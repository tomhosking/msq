"Are German Merkur or Herkules hops noble enough to sub in a Pilsener?","<p>On an impulse last week I picked up some German <em>Merkur</em> and <em>Herkules</em> hops from the LHBS to use as flavoring and aroma hops in a pilsner, because I thought they might be an interesting twist. But now I'm not sure if they will really fit the style, or even the style of a ""light lager"", since they're described as primarily bittering with some dual-use on the hop reference sites I've found for <a href=""http://beerlegends.com/merkur-hops"">merkur</a> and a <a href=""http://hopsteiner.com/pdf/EBC%20P16%202007.pdf"">conference poster</a> comparing them. </p>

<p>Has anyone had experience using them for their aroma? Or using them at all? </p>

<p>Both have an AA of around 13-14, which is high for flavoring and aroma schedules, but the labels claim they're good for all parts of the schedule for pilsners. I haven't experimented, but have noticed (and also been told) that you can get a fair amount of bitterness from even a 25 or 30 minute boil, despite conventional knowledge. Does it sound like I might get appropriate bitterness if I left out a bittering hop and threw one of them in around 30 minutes, and the other around 5? And more importantly, which one should be used for each step? I could just open them both and choose after smelling them on brew day, if no one has recommendations.</p>

"Brett, Pedio, Lacto. Reuse and kegging","<p>I have 6 gallons of a bretted whit that has been sitting in the basement for 8 months and a Pedio/Lacto/Brett Dubbel that has been working for about 7 months. </p>

<p>If I wanted to reuse these cultures could I just throw wort on top? I know that one method is to use oak chips to preserve the bugs and use the chips/cubes from beer to beer. </p>

<p>I was thinking of racking the finished beer into kegs that I use for other beers. The issue that I see is the chance of cross contamination. The beer that goes into the kegs is gone within a month so is this really an issue? Would one use a separate keg for bugged beers? </p>

<p>Has anyone used the same equip for bugged beers and had issues? Star San and B-Brite seem like a pretty harsh environment for a yeast to live through if the equip was properly sanitized. </p>

"Need help accenting the ""clove"" character of my Hefes","<p>So I enjoy the heck outa making Hefeweizens. Its a great style and very wonderful when fresh. However, my Hefe's never seem to hit that ""clove"" note properly, they always lean much more towards the ""banana"" side of the flavor spectrum.</p>

<p>I suspect this is because I am a single infusion masher. I've never bothered with a protein rest or any kind of steps, I just hit 150-155F and let it sit for an hour. Works great on my other beers, but I think it's making my Hefe's a little one dimensional.</p>

<p>I ferment in a fridge, usually at 64F, so it's not a temp control issue leading to more banana flavor. Furthermore, I like WLP380 Hefe IV yeast, which is supposed to give more balanced clove/banana than the WLP300. As such, I am pointing the finger at my mash schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have a mash schedule they use to accent the clove character?</strong> And if its not too much, would you mind explaining what volumes of water you use to hit those steps?</p>

<p>Or, if you think there's something else I can try besides a different mash schedule, that would be great too. Thanks!</p>

"Estery fruit flavors in my vanilla bourbon imperial porter","<p>I'm still pretty new to home brewing, so I'm sure I made about a hundred mistakes with this beer. I brewed a 1.079 OG imperial porter, and used Safale 05 (only one pack, unfortunately). First of all, I think I under-pitched the yeast, and then I only kept it in primary for seven days. I tasted it during racking, and there were definitely some pretty distinct fruity flavors there that I did not expect or want. The gravity read 1.032, so I assumed I did not have enough yeast for that big of a beer, and the yeast got really stressed out, hence the fruit. I added 1.70 cups of bourbon, an ounce of oak chips, and three cut-up vanilla beans at secondary, as per the recipe that I found. Since the gravity was still so high, I repitched into secondary with a new pack of 05, hoping that would kick-start more fermentation and get the gravity down to 1.017 where it's supposed to be. After four days, there is barely any activity in the airlock, so I don't think it's fermenting. Is there any hope for this beer turning out, or for those fruity flavors to disappear? I'm also concerned about leaving it in secondary with the oak chips and vanilla beans for too long. Could someone please point me in the right direction?</p>

"What is a protein rest?","<p>I am new to all grain brewing and mashing, however I am about to brew a Belgian Witbier (Northern Brewer all grain kit) and I have a question about the mash schedule.</p>

<p>I have only done a single step mash before (with a batch sparge) which is super easy, however this recipe is calling for a multi step mash:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protein Rest: 122°F for 20 minutes</li>
<li>Sacch’ Rest: 152 F for 60 minutes</li>
<li>Mashout: 170°F for 10 minutes</li>

<p>With the grain bill as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3.5 lbs. Weyermann Pale Wheat</li>
<li>3.5 lbs. Belgian Pilsner</li>
<li>1 lbs. Flaked Oats</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the grains came in 1 pre-mixed bag not separately.</p>

<p>What is a protein rest?  What water ratio do I use for this?  How do I get the mash up to 152 after this (mash in a cooler so I can't apply a heat source), just by add boiling water to it?  If so what should I be looking to keep left over for the sparge/mashout?</p>

<p>I usually use a 1.25 gts./lbs. ratio for mash water and try to hit 6.5 gallons in the brew pot pre-boil.</p>

"Yeast for very high gravity (1.138) stout","<p>I'm planning to brew a very high gravity stout. I'm expecting an OG between about 1.118 and 1.138 depending on how much my efficiency suffers. I've done this before with decent results, but I think I can provide a better fermentation than I have before.</p>

<p>I'm planning to mash pretty low (140-145F) so that I will have a very fermentable wort, and to minimize residual sugars.</p>

<p>I expect that I will want to use two yeasts; one to achieve the desired flavors (esters) and one to brave the extreme alcohol concentration and eat what it can. I'll probably stick with something like Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) for the former; the latter I am a bit unsure about.</p>

<p>In the past, I've used champagne yeast, and I can't say I really had problems with it. However, even with a mash focused in the beta-amylase range, I still had a pretty sweet beer -- even after aging for a couple years. I'm wondering if another high-alcohol-tolerance yeast might attenuate a little better.</p>

<p>To this end, I'm considering using another yeast, like the <a href=""http://www.whitelabs.com/beer/strains_wlp775.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wyeast 775 Cider Yeast</a>, that claims to attenuate much higher (over 80%). Wyeast even claims in its description of the yeast that it can be used for high gravity beers. <strong>In my case in particular, can a yeast really affect attenuation that much?</strong></p>

<p>More subjectively, <strong>would you recommend another yeast for high alcohol fermentation</strong>?</p>

<p>I'm planning to ferment a bit lower to help keep excessive esters / fusel alcohols out. Something like 66F. <strong>Is this appropriate, or will I be hampering fermentation?</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, <strong>should I let let the ""base yeast"" ferment until it has virtually stopped</strong> before pitching my high-alcohol-tolerance yeast, <strong>or should I pitch as it nears its theoretical tolerance limit</strong>? I ask because I'm concerned about the effects that might occur when the yeast hits its limit.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm aiming for a 10 gallon batch.</p>

<p><strong>More Edit:</strong> I'm shooting for as much attenuation as possible. If I can get it up near 80, I'll be quite happy. I think I'll make a low gravity Dry Stout as a starter (5-10 gallons at about 1.040).</p>

"How to properly keep a warm kegged beer (short term)","<p>This is a combination keg/carbonation/beer storage question.</p>

<p>I have only fridge/freezer room for either a carboy or my (currently 1) keg. </p>

<p>I have about half of the corny keg left of a light cream ale, and had to boot it out of my fridge to put in an IPA for a couple/3 week cycle. It was properly carbonated (seemed to work great at 11ish PSI) before I pulled it out and am keeping in a 75ish degree room.</p>

<p>For fun (and science!) I drew a glass off of it yesterday and it was all foam and then flat [tasting] beer under it. </p>

<p>So, my questions, in ""teach a man to fish"" style (and assuming there are no leaks in my system, which I believe to be true):</p>

<p>1) what is the phenomenon that changes how the carbonation level of the beer appears when it is at room temperature? In my mind, I think of a carbonated beer as having bubbles suspended in the liquid once the container is properly pressurized. i.e. a headspace of CO2 that is of sufficient pressure to keep the CO2 suspended in the beer. When dispensing, the pressure equalizes again to maintain that pressure. It's hard for me to visualize how the beer could come out ""flat"" looking if the pressure level of the system hasn't changed. Note, I turned off the CO2 when I took it into room temperature, as it seemed like the right thing to do(?).</p>

<p>Now, at room temp CO2 expands I believe (?), but why exactly did that result in what I observed? I think if I understand that, I'll understand much more about the process.</p>

<p>2) Given #1, and knowing that the beer style matters as far as how it ages, what would you target as a general rule/deadline to get it cold again? </p>

<p>3) Given #1 and #2, should I purge the keg while it is warm and sitting until it's cold again? If so, why?</p>

<p>I know that's a mouthful (or 3), but I feel like I'll understand much more and be able to fish (and drink) if I get these concepts nailed down :)</p>

<p>Thanks! (And as always, if you have articles or chapters of books you'd point to, I'd love those as well/alternately). </p>

"When should I add campden tablets?","<p>So I'm still pretty new to home brewing, I recently finished my first batch of cider from a kit and the end results where ok. Nothing amazing, but it was something I made and feels extra rewarding.</p>

<p>Now onto the question, I plan to start my 2nd brew tomorrow, again, from a cider kit (<a href=""http://www.wilko.com/cider+beer-brewing/wilko-forest-fruits-cider-kit/invt/0318709"" rel=""nofollow"">This kit to be precise</a>). I will be using tap water for my brew, since it's not really possible for me to transport 20 litres (5 gallons) of bottled water, without a car. I want to know, at what stage should I add my campden tablet(s) to remove all chlorine from the water?</p>

<p>Should I put the water in the bucket tonight, add the tablet(s) and then leave it 24hr, before adding the mixture, sugar and yeast?</p>

<p>Or, should I wait till tomorrow, add the sugar and mixture, then add the tablets and wait 24 hours before adding the yeast?</p>

<p>Bonus Question: Best ways to add carbonation to my cider? The sugar added into he pressure keg created lots of c02 to push the liquid out the tap, but the cider itself is flat when tasting.</p>

<p>Thanks and sorry for the long post :)</p>

"Best way to estimate remaining fermentable sugars?","<p>This question is kind of for the chemists here, but I'm open to any ideas.</p>

<p>In this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/15787/yeast-problems"">question</a> Denny Conn, who is far more experienced than me, asserted that a beer is likely finished fermenting, despite being at 1.036 (from a start of 1.056). This would be a beer that's about 2.6% alcohol and 9% unfermentables. To me, that would be undrinkable. Many people suggested rousing the yeast and/or re-pitching to finish out the fermentation.</p>

<p>The important point is, how do you know whether that supposedly stuck beer has any fermentable sugar left? The yeast might have given up early, which is a common enough problem. Or maybe the mash temp was missed by a lot? Or maybe something toxic got into the beer, causing the yeast to die early.</p>

<p>Other than re-pitching and hoping for the best, is there any way to measure the simple sugars? I usually suggest tasting the beer, but the amount of hops will affect the interpretation (as will the taster). I'm hoping for a test as quick and clear as a starch test.</p>
"
"Dynamics temperature measurement","<p>We fight to keep the fermentation temperature controlled, usually constant, but the fermentation is an exothermic activity, so in one side we try to remove energy, and in the other (inside, mainly in the middle), the energy is produced, and keep increasing along the fermentation.</p>

<p>So, if we measure the temperature in the fermenter walls we'll get one very near to the last one applied in the environment that is cooling the fermenter. But if we measure inside the fermenter (the wort), and keep going from edges to the center of the fermenter, the temperature grows progressively.</p>

<p>Considering the thermodynamics in fermentation when cooling is done from fermenter walls, if we measure the most hot point, we will have a lot of wort (in the fermenter edges) some degrees below the expected temperature. So if we measure it in the edges, we'll have a lot of wort (in the center) above the expected temperature.

"Kegging process and serving PSI","<p>I'm now the proud owner of a corny keg. I just have a couple of questions about carbonating the beer and then what to do during / after serving.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, to carbonate the beer I just need to stick the Keg + Co2 tank at 10/12 PSI in a fridge at around 7C / 45f for a week.</p>

<p>Then I can turn the gas off to minimize leaking.</p>

<p>My first question is, <strong>what PSI to serve at</strong>?</p>

<p>I purchased <a href=""https://www.thehomebrewcompany.ie/flexitap-hose-and-out-disconnect-p-65.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this dispenser</a> + hose + tap solution which has me worried. The length of the tube is about 22cm or 8.66"". The width of the tube seems to be 5/16"" or 8mm. Material appears to be PVC braided vinyl. The height from the keg seems negligible given the length of the dispenser.</p>

<p>I have had a look at some of the <a href=""http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/07/18/getting-a-good-pour-kegged-beer-co2-line-length-and-pressure/"" rel=""nofollow"">calculations</a> for dispensing the beer but I'm don't think I'm doing it right.</p>

<p>It seems that I would have to bleed the all the gas from the keg before serving and then set the pressure to about 1 PSI to get anything except foam out of it. Would I then have to set the pressure back to 10 PSI to ensure the beer stays carbonated?</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if I should bite the bullet and purchase something like <a href=""https://www.thehomebrewcompany.ie/beer-line-assembly-ball-lock-and-tap-p-2556.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> to avoid any headaches when pouring day comes around.</p>

"Homebrewing Soda, Safety Concerns","<p>I wanted to try making my own soda this summer, and finally got around to it 10 days ago. <strong>Here's the thing.

"Krausening / Pitching Actively-Fermenting Wort","<p>I heard on one of the old Jamil shows that pitching actively-fermenting starter is a good way to get noticeable but subtle yeast character in a beer.  You need to start with an adequate amount of yeast, but basically to 'get the yeast going' before pitching it.  He was referring specifically to saisons, where you want a good amount, but (IMO) still subtle ester and phenol production, and a complete fermentation.  He was saying it was better to do this as opposed to purposely underpitching or fermenting hot, both of which are risky to say the least.  </p>

<p>We ended up trying this on two IPA's with Conan yeast (from which we wanted ester production) and the results were awesome.  78 and 82% attenuation with the esters we wanted.  </p>

<p>My question is does anyone know the science behind this method, assuming, as stated, equivalent pitch rates?  Why it creates SOME yeast 'character', but not too much?  The yeast are already in the growth phase, and I guess it would maybe minimize lag phase?</p>

"Making a French Cider","<p>Ahoy! </p>

<p>I've been making ciders for last year (with more experience on beers and meads). Two things happened. I tried a french cider couple a month ago and I liked it to the point, that I won't mind making it myself. Also, 5 weeks ago I used French Saison Yeast (Wyeast 3711) on my common cider and on my session mead (both SG=1.050, FG=1.002). The result was fantastic (awesome aroma, taste and even appearance is somewhat close to the standard).</p>

Would it be too odd and out of style if I use Saison Yeast?</p>

"My ginger beer is a thick sludge. Where might I have gone wrong?","<p>I'm a novice fermenter who loves ginger beer, so I thought I'd try to make my own. I ordered some ginger beer plant from these guys and followed their guide: <a href=""http://www.yemoos.com/gingerbeerguide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yemoos.com/gingerbeerguide.html</a></p>

<p>For my first batch I added 1/2 cup white sugar, GBP, and the juice of 4"" of ginger root to a quart of water. I let it sit covered with cloth for 4 days, then I strained the liquid into two swingtop bottles and added 1 tsp. of white sugar to each bottle. I put the bottles in the fridge and ""burped"" them every day. After 3 days I tried the ginger beer, but it was too flat and sweet. The problem seemed obvious to me: I didn't allow enough time, and the fridge was too cold, for good fermentation.</p>

<p>For the second batch I added 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, the GBP I separated from the 1st batch, and ginger juice to a quart of water. This time I let it sit for 7 days. I strained the liquid into 2 bottles again, but did not add extra sugar (I think I must have been scared of too much sweetness at the end). I did not put the bottles in the fridge but let them sit for 7 more days, opening them daily to release pressure (of which there didn't seem to be any).</p>

<p>Today I poured one of the bottles into a glass and a thick sludge came out. I tried a sip, and it did seem to have an alcohol bite to it, but this is definitely not what I had in mind.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that if I only place a single o-ring on each dip tube, the posts leak from underneath.

<p>Put another way, do ions like Calcium, sulfate, carbonate, magnesium, etc. have a direct impact on mash efficiency or is their role limited to adjusting Ph?</p>

<p>Back story:  Brewed on Sunday for the first time with reverse osmosis water, which has virtually no water ions and a Ph of 7.  I used a buffering solution to adjust Ph to 5.2, confirmed with a digital Ph meter.  Other than that, I did not add back those ions until the boil phase.  My efficiency was horrible.  I think it was because I was also using new grain bags that were too tight, but I'm curious whether I should add the salts BEFORE the mash. </p>

"Input on recipe idea (are my calculations correct)","<p>I'm looking for some input as to whether my planned recipe looks right.  I have only just finished my first ever brew and wanted to try my hand at pulling together my own recipe (but I am not skilled enough, nor do I have all necessary equipment to do all grain or start partial mashes, so would be looking at extract with some steeped speciality grains).  At the same time, I have been drinking a lot of Brooklyn Brewer's Sorachi Ace saison beer recently and it is probably my favourite ever beer, so I though I would try and clone it. </p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/perennial-brews/brooklyn-sorachi-ace"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brooklyn website</a> I know that the beer has an OG of 15 degrees plato (about 1.062 gravity) and an IBU of 34.  I also know that a little while back, they produced a homebrew kit which shows the hopping schedule but unfortunately not quantities (1/8 hops @ 60mins; 1/8 hops @ 30mins; 4/8 hops @ 0mins when boil is turned off and remaining 2/8 hops for dry hopping after 3 days of fermentation).  I know they use a belgian strain yeast too.  So... I was thinking of something like this:</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the calculations look right?  </li>
<li>The hops added at 0 mins when the heat is turned off and Belgian candi sugar stirred in to dissolve - my understanding is that there will be no efficiency and therefore no IBU contribution.  If they are being strained from the wort, is this not a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> (given the amount used) waste of money and hops? Or is it a case that there <em>would</em> be an IBU contribution while the candi sugar is added and dissolved and then while the wort cools?  If so, I definitely need to rethink my hop schedule, but I'm not sure how to calculate IBU contribution while the wort cools in order to adjust my other scheduled amounts.</li>
<li>The yeast - Brooklyn use their own strain of Belgian yeast so I figured this would do the job - but does anyone know if it will be good for a beer that typically has or aims to achieve an FG of around 1.005 or an ABV of approx. 7.2%?</li>
</ol>

1lb Belgian Candi Sugar (clear) (typical yield 36ppg) - (36 x 1) / 6 = 6
Total Points / OG - 62.2 / 1.062
Boil Gravity @ 3 gallon boil - ((8 x 40) / 3) + ((1.25 x 14) / 3) = 112.5

Method
1.  Add Crystal Malt (in grain bag) to 3 gallons of water, bring to 160F and steep for 30 minutes.
2.  After 30 minutes of steeping, remove grain bag, bring wort to boil and add DME plus 1.25oz hops.
3.  After 30 minutes of boil, add further 1.25oz Hops and continue boil.
4.  After 60 minutes of boil, turn off heat and add 5oz hops.  Stir in Belgian Candi Sugar to dissolve.
5.  Add wort to ice bath and use wort chiller to cool to 65F and add to fermentation vessel.
6.  Add cool water to bring wort to 6 gallons.
7.  Pitch yeast.
8.  Insert blow off tube with other end in bowl of sanitiser solution.
9.  After 3 days (or when vigorous bubbling subsides) remove blow off tube, add 2.5oz Hops to grain bag and add to wort.  Insert airlock and continue fermentation for remainder of two week schedule.

<p>I'm trying go for around 1.05 FG and 7%~10% ABV. This can be done easily fermenting dry then adding honey afterwards. But if I want to make it sparking I need to ferment it further, which will either leave me with a dry sparkling mead or a a semi-sweet flat mead... Or a bottle bomb.</p>

<p>I was thinking about it and I came up with three ideas.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fermented it dry, add extra honey for priming, add a non-fermenting sweetener (Stevia? Lactose? Xylitol?)</li>
<li>Fermented it dry, kill the yeast via pasteurization/chemicals, add extra honey to desired FG, add dry ice for carbonation.</li>
<li>Fermented it dry, add extra honey to desired FG, add a bit more honey for the priming, pastureize after a couple of day. (But how to be sure that is in the desired FG/Carbonation?)</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think? Any other ideas? Or is it impossible to do this?</p>

"GCB Materials on Cold Wort Aeration","<p>Currently studying for the General Certificate in Brewing from the IBD.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn't the relatively cool temperature of the wort actually <em>increase</em> the solubility of the oxygen, and so <em>reduce</em> the need for vigorous mixing?</p>

<p>Or is this actually a reference to the aeration taking place inline, and so being at relatively higher pressure than when in the fermentation vessel? If so, I wondered why it isn't listed as a disadvantage for inline <em>hot wort</em> aeration as well.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is:</p>

<ul>
<li>what chemicals to use for cleaning (detergents and sanitizers) </li>
<li>what chemicals to avoid (to not deteriorate the stainless steal)</li>
<li>what tools to use / to avoid (i.e. are ""abrasive cleaning pads"" a no-go, as they scar the surface)?</li>

<p>My brew-setup (pots, fermenters, valves) consists of stainless steel alloys which I want to clean, i.e. remove also not eye-visible biological agents (in order to avoid contamination. Even though my setup is stainless steel alloys of the 300 series, it might be necessary to follow up any cleaning agent, with a passivating, re-passivation step, as to not risk the anti-corrosive attribute of the stainless steel.</p>

"Are there levels of infection in a beer or is it a case that it's either ""infected"" or ""not infected""?","<p>I am trying to understand the nature of infections in beer. I find it difficult to imagine ( considering there are wild yeasts and moulds and micro-organisms in the air - aren't there? ) a scenario where a beer is 100% free of infection, <strong>or is this normally the case with a properly brewed batch?</strong> Or is it a case that when infection is lower than some threshold we don't notice it and that beer is considered to not be infected? </p>

<p>I am interested because being new to homebrew and educating my palate, particularly with regard to off flavours I often wonder whether I have some kind of infection. But I would usually discount this if the beer is question is pretty drinkable, because I would have assumed that an infected beer would REALLY stand out and not really the kind of thing easily confused with an off flavour, but considering what I was asking about above; could it be possible to have a small amount, or even a tiny amount, of infection being responsible for off flavour if we define infection as ""above a certain ( detectable ) threshold""?</p>

<p>If that's the case then is it a case that we're trying to <em>reduce</em> infection rather than avoid it, <strong>or is it possible to avoid it <em>altogether</em></strong> - and <strong>is it a case that minute infections are common but to the degree that we eradicate these we are likely to get better tasting beers?</strong></p>

"Safale US-05 Temperature Drop","<p>I am brewing a stout and using Safale US-05. Here in middle Georgia the weather is already plenty warm so I'm using a water bath to keep my wort at a stable temperature. I pitched this yeast at a temp of 60°F and planned to let the temp gradually grow 1-2 degrees per day until primary was finished. I'm on my fourth day of fermentation. Things seemed to be still going well until I checked my wort temp this morning and it was 69°F. </p>

<p>I was worried about the temperature rising too much while at work, so I chucked a frozen gallon jug in the water bath to <strong><em>neutralize</em></strong> the yeast activity, but I came home on my lunch break to find the wort temp at around 62°F. Obviously, I'm worried about the yeasties going down for a nap prematurely. </p>

<p>The first recipe on the second page I linked calls for just over 1 pound for a total of 1 gallon of liquid (including the juice from the oranges).</p>

<p>And then the second recipe on the second page also calls for 3 pounds of sugar.</p>

<p>Is there a reason that orange wine recipes seem to call for so much sugar? Is it likely that the sugar will be consumed during fermentation, producing a dry, high-alcohol drink, or is the quantity of sugar so high to ensure a sweeter final product?</p>

"Would this grain bill make an Amber Ale?","<p>I am planning a small experimental 1 gallon BIAB batch of something like an Amber Ale.  According to one article I've found:</p>

<p><strong>Description of Typical Grain Bill</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amber Ale is traditionally made with American two row pale malt as the
  base, making up 60-85% of the grain bill. Medium to dark crystal malts
  are used to provide color and caramel flavor, typically making up
  10-20% of the grain bill.</p>

<li>2 lbs. Briess Organic 2-Row</li>
<li>0.5 lb.  Briess Caramel 60L</li>
<li>0.5 lb.  Crisp Amber Malt</li>
</ul>

<p>If I were to follow the amounts above, which would put my base malt at 66% and medium/dark malts at 33% (higher than normal for this style), what would I get? </p>

I did BIAB for 1 hour and put right into a fermenter. I let it cool down to about 100 °F and pitched 2 pills of Lactobacillus plantarum from Swanson Probiotics. It sits in a room without A/C, so the heat remains fairly high especially now with a heat wave in Southern California. Day 2 I added 2 more lacto pills. </p>

"Can I increase secondary fermentation temperature after a week?","<p>My ale batch (US-05) was <strong>fermented</strong> at <em>68ºF for 11 days</em>, when I removed the sediment and moved it to a <strong>Secondary Fermentation</strong> with a much lower temperature <em>(41ºF) for a week now</em>.</p>

"Maintaining a constant room temperature","<p>There's a lot of discussion about maintaining the correct temperature of fermentation vessels, but pretty much all of the stuff I read assumes people are either in the desert or the arctic! Being in the north of England our outside temperature can vary (in extreme cases) between -10C (14F) and 30C (86F). There are times when I would be wanting to reduce the temperature of my FV, but other times when I would like to raise it.</p>

<p>There are methods like the wet blanket, refrigerator, or fish tank heater solutions but all of these require that you man a sentinel post to watch over your brew to tweak the temperature either way.</p>

<p>So, let's say I'm wanting to set up a dedicated fermentation room (and perhaps another dedicated conditioning room) and I want to keep the temperature constant which may involve either heating or warming compared to the outside temperature. I would also like to use a ""set it and forget it"" type system. What is the easiest way to achieve this? Is there a single type of product that can do this or do I need to rely on separate heating and cooling systems?</p>

<p>In the UK we don't have houses with air conditioning as standard because it is rarely used - therefore I have no real experience of its capabilities other than their use for cooling hot, stuffy offices... would that be the correct solution?</p>

"How to Use a Johnson Digital Temperature Controller with a Fermwrap - General Questions","<p>This is my first temperature controller and first use of a Fermwrap.</p>

<p>I understand that the Johnson A419 Temperature Controller can only do hot or cold at one time. Which mode does it default to when you buy it?</p>

<p>I plugged in the Fermwrap into the controller and set the controller's set point to 80F. The Controller read 66F, but the Fermwrap did not warm up. Not sure whether or not the default mode was cold, I set the set point to 50*F and a green light switched on. I assume this means that the Fermwrap is about to warm up. I flipped the jumpers to set the controller to hot mode.</p>

<p>I set the controller's set point to 80*F and the differential to 1.</p>

<p>I laid the Fermwrap on the ground and put the johnson probe directly on it, and the probe quickly warmed to ~74*F. </p>

<p>I then taped the Fermwrap onto a carboy full of water. My Raspberry Pi with its waterproof DS18B20 temperature probe is telling me the water is 65.18*F. The Johnson probe that I taped to the carboy with styrafoam is at 68*f.</p>

<p>The water in the carboy is not heating up -- How hot can the Fermawrap get? Or more appropriately, given an ambient temperature, let's say 40*F, can the Fermwrap pull the carboy up to 60-70*F? I've read about people using a freezer with Fermwraps wrapped around a carboy to support ale temperatures, so I would think this would be OK.</p>

<p>I'll update this question, but the carboy is not moving up in temperature. The Fermwrap barely goes around 1/2 of the circumference of the carboy.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if it will just take a while to heat that much water and/or if the Fermwrap is simply ineffectual. The temperature is supposed to drop to 45*F tonight. Can I expect the Fermwrap to counter the drop in temperature quickly enough?</p>

<p>Are there any tricks I should be doing? I thought about wrapping the carboy in some kind of insulating material, but the piece of paper that came with the fermwrap suggested that this would be inappropriate. </p>

<p>Edit - 17:50 PST the temperature of the water has increased from 65.18 to 65.3.</p>

<p>Edit - 18:10 PST increased to 65.4116*F</p>

<p>Edit - 18:50 PST increased to 65.6366*F. The Johnson probe on the outside of the carboy says 72*F. I thought it would have been in line with the temperature of the water in the carboy.</p>

<p>Edit - 23:10 PST increased to 68.45*F. Johnson probe reads a whopping 76*F. This doesn't look good.</p>

<p>Edit - 01:00 PST increased to 70.025</p>

<p>It was a Double IPA kit from Brewer's Best, with Columbus hops for flavor and Cascade hops for aroma.</p>

<p>I could sit here and try to analyze my beer all day long, but I want to keep this simple and ""pick on"" the two biggest flaws I can detect.  The first is that the hop aroma disappeared almost immediately after opening the bottle.  When I first cracked the cap, it had a nice strong aroma, and after I poured it into my glass it also had an aroma.  However, after a few sips the aroma was gone.</p>

<p>The second flaw was the color, it had much more of an amber color than most double IPA's I have seen.  </p>

<p>So, my questions are, what are some common mistakes or errors in the brewing process which I could look to correct in my second batch to reverse these flaws??</p>

<p>I boiled for 60 minutes, adding Columbus Hops at the start and with 15 minutes left, and then adding the Cascade hops at the end.  I let the wort cool in an ice bath, and it took about 2 hours to cool.  I transferred to my primary fermenter via a siphon, and I let it ferment for 15 days.  I bottled on 12/30/2013 and two weeks later (today) I cracked open my first bottle.</p>

<p>Thanks!

"Thick blobs of yeast cake looking stuff in my bottles (Image Added)","<p>The last batch of beer I have made seems to have a lot more sediment in it than any of my other beers. It has been sitting for 3 weeks and some of the bottles when I pour have gloopy looking sediment which I am presuming is a yeast cake type of thing?</p>

<p>The beer is a Muntons Connoisseurs Larger with an OG of 1.048. I used Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 for the first time (instead of 1kg of dextrose) and added an extra cup of castor sugar. After 6 days fermenting I added Wakatu hops by dry hopping without using a muslin bag and let it sit for another 10 days before bottling. The FG was 1.010.</p>

<p>The beer tastes fine but there is a bit of wastage when I am pouring them. Is the extra sediment cause by the use of the Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 or is it something else I may have done? </p>

<p>The only difference between this beer and the others I have made is the additional Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 and not using a muslin bag with the hops. I also note that the OG and FG are higher than I normally would have.</p>

<p>Here is the difference between two beers I have done. One was using the method above, the other was using dextrose, and hopped in a muslin bag. I had to use the flash for the image so you cant see the clarity as good but you can see the sediment better.

I tried adding more sugar and mixing, but that didn't seem to make any difference. The mixture inside is very dense, dark and strong, so I can't really see what's going on in there. It's also not very wet.</p>

<p>The question is: should I be worried by this lack of activity, or is it natural for this kind of brewing? Should I be doing anything to fix it, or just leaving it alone?</p>

"Is this recipe correct","<p>Hi I'm brewing some apple wine at the moment, following a recipe for a dry apple wine from CJJ Berry's ""First Steps in Winemaking"" (2006 reprint p185).</p>

<ul>
<li>2.75k apples (I used golden delicious)</li>
<li>1 kilo sugar</li>
<li>150ml white grape concentrate</li>
<li>1 teaspoon citric acid</li>
<li>4.5L water</li>
<li>Yeast &amp; nutrient</li>
</ul>

<p>At no point in the recipe does it mention adding the citric acid, but it does mention within the method that you should ""strain the stewed apple liquid onto the sugar and the <em>thinly peeled rind of the lemon</em> "" (my emphasis). The lemon juice is added with the yeast. The lemon is never mentioned in the ingredients. </p>

<p>Obviously there's a printing error/typo that never got picked up in proofing, but should I be using both lemon and citric acid, or only one? The wine has just about stopped fermenting, and I'm about to rack it off for bulk aging. If I needed to add the citric acid now (I used only the lemon) is it too late?</p>

"Longer time on yeast for a bigger beer?","<p>I ferment all my beers single stage in a glass carboy immersed in a water bath to maintain temperature. This is the first time I've made a bigger beer (this one started at 1.080) on this system. I made a nice big starter and aerated twice. It took off well and visible signs of yeast activity are essentially gone after a week; everything looks great.</p>

<p>Typically I would allow another 1-2 weeks for the yeast to clean up before bottling. <strong><em>My question is: with a bigger beer, and without the option of transferring to another vessel for conditioning (other than a bottle), should I give the beer more extra time on the yeast, or less?</em></strong></p>

<p>I would guess that additional time would allow the yeast to clean up the larger amount of by-products it likely produced during the adaptation and attenuative phases, but the environment inside the fermentor is also more hostile, so perhaps off flavours from old and dying yeast, which I normally am not concerned with, and have not noticed in my beers, are worth worrying about now?</p>

<p>Just like the questioner in that article, I thought that protein rests were unnecessary for well-modified malts, but Mr Wizard says that brewers still consider a protein rest necessary where there is 20% of more wheat in the grain bill (for clarity purposes, I guess), or to ease separate of wort in the lauter.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me, because it seems that any proteolytic enzymes in the malted wheat (and other malts) would have been destroyed by the malting process, meaning that no protein is being affected by the protein rest. Is it correct that there are no or negligible amounts of proteolytic enzymes in modern malted grains?</p>

<pre><code>5L water
40g Waimea Hops (17% alpha acid)
1 kg Pale ale malt
150 g caramel malt (caraamber 60-80)

10g added 15 min prior to the end of the cook
20g added 0 min prior to the end of the cook

"How to use ""natural"" Irish moss","<p>I've just bought this stuff (pictured) - what appears to be Irish moss in its natural, dried state.</p>

<p>Being a bit of a noob I haven't used Irish moss before, thinking (perhaps foolishly) that my beers could be clear with it. Nope... at least, not so far. So, I bought this particular product for a couple of reasons...</p>

<ol>
<li>For various personal reasons I like to keep my beers as ""natural"" as possible - I'd rather not start adding pig bones, fish bits, or lab-produced carrageenan. Call me weird, but I'd rather avoid anything that comes in those little white snap-top pots with unclear labelling. So, if I'm going to start using some kind of clearing agent I'd rather be using something that is as natural as possible... hence this choice of product over normal pre-prepared Irish moss.</li>
<li>This product cost only £10 for 250g, which is at least 50% cheaper than buying it in pots.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is, simply and noobishly, how best do I use this? Perhaps more specifically...</p>

<ul>
<li>Generically, how much do I use? Currently I'm doing 5 gallon batches.</li>
<li>Do I put it in the last 15 minutes of the boil?</li>

"Define ""yeast slurry""","<p>If I'm creating a yeast starter from previously harvested yeast I'm supposed to know how many cells are in my slurry to effectively calculate how much yeast to use in my next batch.</p>

<p>To me common sense suggests that a fully-settled layer in the refrigerator will be pretty consistent in the number of yeast cell per unit volume - some may not be viable, yes, but a consistent density non-the-less.</p>

<p>However, as far as I understand it, and according to Wyeast (<a href=""http://www.wyeastlab.com/com-yeast-harvest.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wyeastlab.com/com-yeast-harvest.cfm</a>) a yeast slurry is <em>not</em> the fully-settled layer but the yeast in suspension prior to it settling out (settling out is simply a mechanism to allow the brewer to gauge how much yeast is in a slurry). Therefore, isn't this purely down to how much water I've added whilst harvesting? How do I know how dense the yeast population is in a watery slurry like that? Isn't it best to work from the settled layer?</p>

<p>By my reckoning, and reading the Wyeast page, there are approximately 2 billion yeast cells per millilitre of fully-settled yeast cake. Is this not a more sensible way to gauge your slurry?</p>

"Canning unfermented wort for yeast farming?","<p>Canning is often used to preserve foods: the microorganisms inside mason jars are killed by a boiling water bath and sealed when removed. Small amounts of unfermented wort are useful when yeast farming. Has anyone tried canning unfermented wort so that you have a small amount on hand? Specifically I'm thinking of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparing the mix like a yeast starter. Say 1/2 cup of dried malt
extract to half a liter of water. (Per quart jar- leaving them
roughly half full.)</li>
<li>Cap the jars with standard canning lids and
bands. </li>
<li>Process in a boiling hot water bath for 15 minutes. (My
thoughts: basically the same as boiling for 15 minutes.) </li>
<li>Remove from caner and let cool for 24 hours. (They should seal during this
time.)</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point you'd have jars of unfermented wort ready to use. So instead of going through the whole boiling process for a yeast starter, maybe you just sterile a flask and add in the wort and yeast.</p>

I am thinking about putting the fermenter in a large tub of water and sticking it in a spare room where the temp fluctuates between 66°F and 70°F, hoping that internal beer temps will stay in the high 60s°F. Will this higher temp lead to production of esters inappropriate for these styles?</li>
<li>I have heard that Irish Ale yeasts sometimes have trouble finishing. Have you experienced this? This may be subjective, but would you recommend another yeast for the stout to achieve adequate dryness? I have seen many recipes call for US-05.</li>

"Interpreting single-infusion mash instructions with two temperatures listed","<p>I've been brewing all-grain for a while now, but I can't figure out why the recipes I read have the following.  Take this example:</p>

<pre><code>Mash Schedule: Single Infusion, Light Body
Total Grain Weight: 10.25 lb (4.7Kg)
Single Infusion, Light Body
Step Time Name Description Step Temp 
75 min Mash In Add 12.81 qt of water at 163.7°F 152.0°F 
10 min Mash Out Add 8.20 qt of water at 196.6°F 168.0°F 
Sparge with 2.64 gallons 168.0°F water
</code></pre>

<p>Why do the Mash In and Mash Out have two different temperature readings if it's single infusion?  Did the brewer mash in at the first temp (in this case 163.7°F/73°C) to get to the second temp (152.0°F/67°C)?  This is what is seems to me, yet if that is the case I don't think mashing out at 196.6°F would get to a final temp of 168°F.  In any event, if someone could clarify this for me it would be appreciated!</p>

"Correction of Tinseth's for pellets vs cones","<p>As I understand Tinseth's formula is derived from curve fitting (as I read it from his <a href=""http://realbeer.com/hops/research.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>). </p>

<p>However I can't see if he's using pellets or cones and I think that the utilization differs. I expect that eventually one would get the same utilization from hops and pellets so the difference in the formula should then be in the time constant in the time factor. That would lead to a formula like:</p>

<pre><code>IBU = ... (1-exp(-kt))/4.15
</code></pre>

<p>Should one use different value for <code>k</code> depending on if I use pellets or whole hops? Which one does the standard value of <code>k=0.04</code> applie? Or is there a different formula for the use of pellets or whole hops?</p>

"Mashing in food-grade plastic fermentation bucket","<p>So I have been dabbling with the use of my sous vide immersion heater for maintaining a perfect mash temperature (it's pretty unbelievable how efficient and accurate these guys are). I have only been doing smaller batches (~3 gallons) up until now. As I have looked to go bigger I have tried to find polycarbonate food bath containers that are large enough, but without much luck. Then it hit me...my <a href=""https://www.morebeer.com/products/bottling-fermentation-bucket-spigot-6-gallon.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MoreBeer Buckets</a> are food grade up to 180 degrees!</p>

<p>So, my plan is to mash in there and then move to two 6 gallon kettles for a split boil (working with an electric glass stove top that won't allow me to achieve a boil on a full 5+ gallons of wort). </p>

<p>Question is, do you think the <a href=""https://www.morebeer.com/products/rotating-spigot-bucket-sediment-block.html?site_id=9"" rel=""noreferrer"">spigots</a> are also food grade? If not, I can always just use my bucket that does not have a hole/spigot, but it would be much easier to transfer the mashed liquid into the two kettles with the spigot vs. pouring straight from the bucket or siphoning. </p>

"Exactly how big is a ball lock keg post supposed to be","<p>I recently ordered a pair of used ball lock Cornelius kegs from a website. One of the posts of one of the kegs is slightly bigger than the other. In order to get the beer out line onto the keg in the first place, I needed a mallet. I could not get the out line off even with a monkey wrench and a screwdriver. I eventually chopped the ball lock connector in half with a dremel tool.</p>

<p>The problem post is 15.81 mm. I was able to measure 4 other posts, on my various other kegs. They measure 15.53mm, 15.63mm, 15.47mm, 15.83mm. This is about 0.3mm of difference between the biggest and smallest parts. I have never put a connector on the 15.83mm post. </p>

<p>For my day job, I am an engineer. When two parts are supposed to snap together, it is important to machine those parts to a precise size, or you will find yourself jamming things together and prying them apart. 0.3 mm sounds very small, but it makes a huge difference in whether two parts can fit.</p>

<p>On my old keg, I have always had trouble with one of the posts. I always have to fight to get connectors on and off of it. I suspect that I have an issue with an incorrectly sized post or an incorrectly sized connector.</p>

<p>How big is a ball lock post supposed to be? Are sticky, difficult connectors a common problem?</p>

"New England IPA - What sets it apart from a ""traditional"" IPA?","<h2>Background</h2>

After reading <a href=""https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/news/new-england-ipa-haze-craze/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, I've gathered that it features fruitiness, cloudiness, and somewhat creamy medium bitterness. The specific aromatics and tastes seem to be a bit at-large. Haziness also seems to be a consistent characteristic.</p>

<p>After having done a few West Coast IPAs (largely consisting of Cascade, Simcoe, and Centennial pellets), I haven't been able to nail down exactly which hops, yeasts, or other ingredients seem to be ""successful"" for this style.

"Soda: Fermentation dynamics and off-flavours","<p>I came here not only to solve my off-flavour issue, but also to learn more about early stage of fermentation. I am making sodas (mostly Ginger Beer) which I am fermenting for carbonation. Everything went well all winter and I didn't have an issue, but suddenly, two batches in a row, I am smelling and tasting solvent like/nail polish off-flavour. According to the descriptors it seems like it could be ethyl-acetate. The recipe I am using stayed the same, I suppose this could have something to do with the dynamics of the fermentation.</p>

<p>My variables are following: I have a 13 Brix solution made with inverted cane sugar (its taste is part of the drink's signature) and I am pitching it with 2.5g of EC-1118 per 10 litres. What has changed is temperature. In the winter I have put the fermenter in the warmest place in the house (+/- 21 °C), now that the heating is turned off, the temperature has actually dropped to around 17 °C. The fermentation is noticeably slower. The usual 24 hours in the primary produced less froth and the finished soda is less carbonated after similar time in the bottle (i usually pasteurise after 16-20 hours of in-bottle carbonation, staying rather on the safe side)</p>

<p>What seems a little counterintuitive is that most discussions and resources online point to high pitching temperatures as the main culprit. Others say that actually low temperatures actually help the production of esters. One resource hinted me at the concurrence of high metabolism and low growth rate. However my current sugar content should be a piece of pie for the EC-1118, so I wouldn't think this is high SG problem. </p>

<p>Should I just pitch more in lower temps? Or should I avoid lower temps altogether?  I have rejected the idea of too much aeration, I doubt the yeast would respire with this much sugar. Am I missing something? Thanks for discussing, I am keen on learning more about the mechanics of the process:-)</p>

"Flavoring Cider at bottling","<p>The general caution I read when I started this batch of cider was to not do flavoring during fermentation as to avoid off taste weirdness. So my cider is now fermented and I'd like to keep it dry but would like to add some flavoring. Potentially ginger. 
I have carbonation drops that I plan to use for carbonation, I figure these will impart some sweetness by themselves whether I like it or not. But in terms of adding flavoring, what are my options?  To do ginger at this point my only idea is to gri her ginger and steep it like a tea to make some sort of ginger flavored water, then add some to each bottle right as I bottle. But I would guess That ginger will naturally have some sugar in it(?) so I fear that might screw things up.

<p>I've browsed several questions on this site relating to high gravity beers and the tendency seems to be towards putting in all fermentables and yeast(s) right at the start of fermentation and just letting it crack on.</p>

<p>My question is, is this method more favourable over doing a secondary pitch of yeast along with a secondary addition of fermentables into the primary after an initial fermentation period?</p>

<p>My plan was to initially use enough fermentables to reach 6/7% ABV (FG equivalent) using US-05 at the low end of the fermentation temperature range, leave that to go for 3/4 days and take a gravity reading. Following on from that, I would add a second lot of boiled malt along with a high ABV tolerant yeast and allow that to ferment slowly over the next week or so, slowing upping the temperature until everything has fermented out. How does this sound?</p>

I racked it, added sulphites (Campden tabs), added fining, left for a couple of months. At this point the wine smelled great, but had a bitter aftertaste (not acidic), probably a bacterial effect, so I racked again and filtered, giving me a nice clear wine that tasted fine, with an alcolohol content of about 6.4%.</p>

<p>After reading various articles on sparkling wine making, I added more Campden tabs (a smaller amount) to ensure there were no more bacteria and left it for 2 days for it to gas out. Then I added yeast and a sugar solution for the secondary fermentation and bottled it. Now I'm finding that the fermentation is stuck - after a week, there is nothing happening in the bottles, no gas production at all. I've read that sulphites should be gone within a day or two, so it's OK to use them for sparkling wines if they are given time. I've also read that though sulphites are often used to 'kill' yeasts, they don't apparently kill them, just slow them down.</p>

<p>Is my second fermentation dead? Or do I just need to give it more time?</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>As the posted answers suggested it might, this did eventually kick off and it'a been a success overall. I'm still getting a slight bitter aftertaste, so this year I'll get the sulphites in earlier to make sure I kill off any bacteria before they get a chance to take hold.</p>

"Will this recipe make drinkable mead?","<p>I want to make mead, but lack any real equipment/skill. <strong><em>I have done ""wine"" and ""mead"" before, but only at the ""hooch"" level of quality and control.</em></strong> All I have access to is a siphon tube and ~2L plastic bottles. There is a store that sells brewing equipment, but I didn't think I cared much for clearing my wine or stopping the yeast from producing since I do not trust the products that well. This may be an argument from ignorance though so bear with me. </p>

<p><em>My idea was to:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>use 12oz of honey, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/2 of orange and some orange zest.</li>
<li>sanitize equipment(2L bottles) via antibacterial soap and/or rubbing alcohol. Let dry upside down, rinse several times.</li>
<li>put ingredients into 2L bottle, fill 4/5ths the way full with water, shake to mix.</li>
<li>add 1 packet of bread yeast, shake to mix.</li>
<li>close cap until almost shut to allow for airflow for C02 out of the bottle.</li>
<li>cover cap with rubber glove, tied at base to prevent contaminants from dust, and to allow for determination of fermentation via C02 production.</li>
<li>wait 3 weeks, use sterilized siphon filter off from top of bottle my ""mead"", into new sterile container. Cap tight, refrigerate?</li>
<li>enjoy????</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess the only thing i am concerned about is caping the bottle tight after I re-bottle it, for if fermentation is still active, it could cause a bursting of the bottle. I could try and do SG readings with a hydrometer I  have, but I feel given my lack of equipment( no graduated cylinder ), exposing my product to air to test multiple times would be folly and pointless. <strong>Should I attempt to degass in any way, and if so how would I given my lack of equipment/skill?</strong></p>

"Should I factor out sugar-to-alcohol conversion in stage 2 of a three-wort batch?","<p>I am planning to make a tripel with OG near 1.085. I need to make a strong starter before subjecting yeast to that kind of gravity. I have read that 1.040 is a good gravity for making a starter. So I have the following plan in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cook a 1-gallon first wort with an OG of 1.040. Pitch one Wyeast activator pack.</li>
<li>After 24-36 hours, cook 2 more gallons of wort, cool, and add to the first gallon.</li>
<li>After another 24-36 hours, cook, cool and add the rest of the wort to a total of 5.5 gallons, with all the remaining fermentables to bring the estimated OG to 1.085 (that's a 1.085 if all fermentables had gone into all 5.5 gallons from the start.)</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is at stage 2. Regardless of whatever else might be wrong with this plan, should I:</p>

<ol>
<li>be adding 2 gallons of 1.040 wort, being consistent with the 1.040 ideal for starters? Or</li>
<li>since I am about to add it to one gallon that has already underwent some fermentation, should I add something more like 2 gallons at 1.050? That will then average out to 3 gallons at 1.040, but with some alcohol content already present?</li>
</ol>

<p>Which choice leaves me with a healthier yeast count for stage 3? (And if my numbers are off - say I should be staring with stage 1 at only 0.5 gallon instead of 1 - I'd still like to know if in principle I should be factoring out the gravity that has already been fermented away.)</p>

<p>And if there is anything else wrong with this plan, don't hesitate to let me know :) The  fermentables are:
11 lb extra light LME,
1 lb specialty grains,
1 lb liquid candi sugar,
and 0.5 lb maple sugar,
brought up to 5.5 gallons.</p>

"What amounts and times should I use to clean/sterilize my brewing equipment?","<p>There are actually 2 questions here. The first one is more of an opinion (although I would like to know), but the correct answer will only be awarded for the second question.</p>

<p>I have been researching online to find out what the best way is to clean and sanitise your equipment. From what I have gathered so far, I was going to use Oxiclean to clean my equipment, and Hydrogen Peroxide to sanitise it.

"Any reason not to lower a hydrometer into my secondary?","<p>Is there any reason not to simply lower a hydrometer into my carboy during secondary fermentation, so that I can monitor gravity just by peeking in with a flashlight? </p>

<p>I'm thinking about doing this with a recent tripel batch, so I don't have to disturb it multiple times by taking readings. I'll take precautions like sterilizing the hydrometer. I also think I will tie something like dental floss (sterilized) to it so that I can gently lower it in, drape the loose end over the lip wedged between the lip and the bung, and remove it safely later.</p>

<p>It'll sit there like an iceberg poking its head out, and I can act early if I start to feel like fermentation has stuck. Keep in mind this a beer I would like to leave in the secondary for 3-6 months.</p>

<p>The TAD came with 3 6L PET bottles.  I have 2 5 gallon batches that are ready to be bottled and I have a 3rd batch I am about to brew, so I wanted to fill 1 6L (1.5g) bottle from each batch and 12oz bottle the rest. My problem is that I can't seem to find a real source that tells me how much priming sugar to use per 1.5g bottle.</p>

<p>I've seen everything from '6 slightly rounded teaspoons per bottle' to '1 heaping tablespoon' to '1/3 cup per 5 gallons'.</p>

<p>EDIT: These 'measurements' do not make me feel good, I usually like to do my sugar by weight.</p>

<p>I would like to know if anybody has any experience with this.</p>

<p>Also, since I am only going to be putting 1.5g out of my 5g into this Tap-a-Draft bottle I normally bottle a 5g batch with 5 oz. of priming sugar.  It looks like the TAD takes much less than that to carbonate (I'm assuming because you use CO2 for the dispenser) so I will need to factor that in, if I use 5 oz. for 5g I should only be using 3.5 oz. to bottle the remaining 3.5g in my 12oz bottles.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.midwestsupplies.com/using-tap-a-draft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here are the instructions from Midwest Supplies</a>.  They say to add 6 rounded teaspoons to each bottle directly.  Do you not need to boil the priming sugar w/ water first?  I usually do that when bottling so that I know it is disolved, then I put that in the bottling bucket and rack my beer out of the carboy onto that to make sure it is mixed well.</p>

<p>Will I be ok if I bottle the TAD with the same ratio of priming sugar that I use for the regular glass bottles or should I be using less priming sugar in these PET bottles meaning I would have to do 2 different mixtures?</p>

"Premature Kegging - leave batch in keg or rack to carboy?","<p>I kegged a batch of hefeweizen on Sunday morning and force carbonated. My all-grain recipe was a combination of several that I found online, but largely an original creation. The plan was to leave the batch in primary for a week and then transfer to secondary for three weeks or so. Life circumstances prevented me from racking the beer to secondary, so it sat in primary for nearly two and half weeks. One of the weizen recipes I consulted called for a two week primary fermentation with no secondary, so I went ahead and kegged without a secondary fermentation.</p>

<p>Things of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pitched one pouch of <a href=""http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=59"" rel=""nofollow"">Wyeast 3638 Bavarian Wheat Blend</a> in wort cooled to 64 degrees. </li>
<li>Fermented at a steady 68 degrees (temperature controlled by putting it in my basement, which is really steadily 68 this time of year).</li>
<li>Fermentation was really active for 4-5 days. After that, there was no visible sign of fermentation activity, however, I did not pull a sample until beer was kegged.</li>
<li>The beer tasted good out of the carboy after 2.5 weeks (albeit 68 degrees and flat)</li>
<li>On Monday night, the batch was sufficiently carbonated but tasted a little green; mostly a little too sweet. Definitely drinkable and on the right track, but I probably jumped the gun a little.</li>
<li>The gravity right before kegging was very near the expected final gravity. Expected OG 1.051, expected FG 1.014; actual OG 1.056, actual FG 1.020. </li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line: the beer doesn't seem finished now that I've carbonated it. Should I leave it in the pressurized keg in the fridge and condition for a few weeks to a month; or should I release pressure, let it go flat, and put it back into a carboy to finish out?</p>

"Ideas for rescuing an under-pitched and under-hopped batch","<p>A few batches ago, I had a ""learning experience"". I now have some pretty good ideas of where I went wrong (mainly, not having any idea how to design a recipe), but I'm wondering what I can do with a case of not-very-tasty (but not completely ruined) beer. This mess started with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using too much molasses (12oz jar of molasses, with 9lbs DME)</li>
<li>Pitching a single smack-pack into a wort with OG of 1.090+</li>
<li>Using about half of the amount of hops I probably needed</li>
</ul>

<p>The batch finished around 1.025, tastes way too sweet, and is not carbonating after about 6 weeks in the bottle. Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warming the bottles up (it's summer in Georgia. They're not too cold)</li>
<li>Inverting the bottles (rewarded me with a tiny hiss after a week. Still flat and sweet)</li>
<li>Mixing with a light beer (it takes a full bottle of light lager with half bottle of my beer-syrup to make something drinkable)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have another batch that is about ready to bottle. I was planning on pouring my remaining 36 bottles of beer-syrup into the empty fermenter (on top of this batch's yeast), and adding a gallon of heavily-hopped light (1.030) wort to try to bring the IBUs and body back in line with something resembling beer. I would let it re-ferment for a few days before re-bottling.</p>

"How does electrical conductivity of a fermenting liquid change over time?","<p>Has anyone ever measured how the conductivity of fermenting liquids changes over time?  </p>

<p>I have a hypothesis that it does change over time, and that as the fermentation rates and stages change, so will the capacitance of the wort.  Also, that one will see more capacitance change during early fermentation, but it will settle down to a steady value as fermentation dies down, flocculation occurs, etc.</p>

<p>Why do I ask?  I would like to digitally measure fermentation activity without directly sampling to measure specific gravity.  Measuring SG would be great, but what I'm really interested in is activity level of fermentation.  I'm not trying to calculate SG - I'll do that when I transfer the batch from primary -> secondary -> bottling.  I'm thinking though that seeing that conductivity value level out is what's the signal for when to transfer.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I've found online that seem to say this might be worth pursuing a bit.  For example here is a paper titled, ""Electrical conductivity as a tool for analysing fermentation processes for production of cheese starters"" <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958694600000601"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958694600000601</a>  </p>

"Using yeast from a local brewery","<p>My favorite local brew-pub has a standing offer to share their yeast with homebrewers; bring in a jar &amp; they will fill it for you.</p>

"Stuck fermentation - Should I be concerned?","<p>On Jan 19, I brewed what will end up being a 5 gal. batch of Nut Brown Ale.  I had decent mash efficiency and ended up at 1.046 @ 68 deg. after the boil and subsequent cool.  I then split the total of six(6) gal of wort evenly into two sanitized corneys.  The evening before I made a yeast starter with 2C water to 1/2C light DME and two packets of Safale S-04 dry Ale Yeast and left it on the stir plate with sanitized foil over the top of the flask.  I pitched this yeast split evenly between the two corneys and sealed and shook/stirred the kegs.  Then I installed my air locks which are nothing more than air in connectors with a copper tube for structure running through a vinyl tube to a regular air lock.  I have used this method once before quite successfully.  I stored these in the den with a brew belt around the middle of both kegs.  After only a few hours, I started to see reasonable activity in the air locks.  Just two days later we were hit with a cold snap that dropped the house temp to between 60 and 64.  At that point, the activity stopped completely.  It is now the 31st of Jan.  The cold snap has been over for a couple days now but the former activity has not resumed.</p>

"What is the scientific explanation behind open fermentation leading to increased esters and yeast flavor & aroma?","<p>As a recent experiment, I wanted to try something that was unconventional for most homebrewers, and is widely considered to be clown-crap crazy.  I wanted to ferment a beer topless, without a lid.  I settled on ten gallons of a Belgian Dubbel, split into two batches, one went into a better bottle with bung and airlock, the other half in a bucket without a lid for the first ~48-72 hours.  For those who haven't tried this, I'd highly recommend it at least once, as it is amazing, being able to look into the beer closet/fridge and seeing the yeast snap, crackle, and pop while you look down on it during fermentation.</p>

<p>Due to space constraints in the keezer, I could only get one of the two on tap at a time, so I opted for the closed fermentation half first, during which time I cold crashed the other half in the lagering fridge.  The closed fermentation tasted very similar to what I would expect for a commercial Dubbel;  subdued yeast character, dark fruit, a little clove, hardly any banana, quite malty, a very calm, typical Belgian ale.  I just kegged off and drew a sample of the topless fermentation half, and the best way of describing it is: Woah!  Completely different flavor and aroma.  I get a very profound banana flavor, some clove, some dark fruit, all of it overpowers any malt flavor.  It's almost undesirable, it's so intense.</p>

<p>What is the scientific explanation behind open fermentation leading to more ester formation during fermentation?  I assume it has something to do with the CO2 pressure blanket over the wort, so I wonder if similar results can be seen if using a carboy with a more confined hole in lieu of a wide open a bucket.  Can anyone explain this?</p>

"Is my beer oxidized?","<p>I brewed a batch of bitter 5 weeks ago, simple recipe with 90 % pale malt and 10 % crystal. IBU is aout 30. I have brewed this beer before, and it was great.</p>

<p>Everything went perfect, up until I pitched yeast. It is a long story: re-pitched yeast harvested from primary from earlier batch (WLP002), but I pitched way too little.

"General questions about controllers","<p>I do 5 gallon all grain batches using a 16 gallon Bayou BK, a 10 gallon water cooler mash tun, and a burner. Eventually I'd like to upgrade my equipment to electric with either a RIMS or HERMS setup, and make some sort of automated system. I've been researching a lot on controllers, but all the information out there is still somewhat fuzzy to me in terms of what they can or cannot do.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can BrewPi (or something similar) control the electric kettle(s)?</li>
<li>When creating your own DIY BrewPi, why do you need a RaspberryPi and
Arduino -- shouldn't the Arduino be able to act as a web server?</li>
<li>Can I hook up a Netduino and have it do all the
monitoring/controlling along with acting as web server? (I know C#/.NET)</li>
<li>Is using a BCS overkill?</li>
<li>What about other kinds, such as Brewtroller?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm thinking of starting small and using the controller to measure/control my fermentation temperature in order to understand things better. Then I want to upgrade my system to electric and have the controller regulate temperatures in the mash. Finally I would want it to control pumps/flow control. Can the BCS do this? Can Arduino/RPi?</p>

"cider - during and after second fermentation","<p>I've just started making my first batch of cider. Using the magnum cider starter kit. Here's the link for instructions so you can see what im doing.. 
<a href=""http://www.home-brew-online.com/magnum-cider-kit-instructions-i50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.home-brew-online.com/magnum-cider-kit-instructions-i50</a></p>

<p>I'm onto the second stage fermentation now and a bit confused on what to do next as the instructions are a bit unclear.</p>

<p>I've transferred ot over into pressure keg and added the 60g of sugar, now it's saying to leave it for around five days and then 'cool to clear'.. what exactly does this mean?
Will it ever stop fermenting in the keg?
Can I store keg in spare fridge in garage to keep cool and ready to drink as and when I need or will this affect the cider?
And can I travel with keg in the car to friends houses etc, or will this disturb segments on bottom if there is any?</p>

<p>Sorry to bombard you with questions but I've search high and low on forums all evening to try and find the answer to these questions</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance 😊 </p>

"When racking my beer, it looked like someone had poured cream in","<p>I made my first beer from a kit and followed the instructions carefully as well as reading around. Specifically, I was very careful about cleaning and sterilisation.</p>

<p>I had a 2 FV setup and after 2 weeks of fermentation racked into my secondary FV when the gravity had stabilised. It all looked fine except that in the first litre or 2 being syphoned into the 2nd FV, I observed a 'creamy blob' floating on top of the beer a bit like an oil patch floating on water. It was quite white and opaque, it looked just like I'd poured a splash of cream in and it was sitting on top.</p>

<p>I was able to remove it with a small sieve in one piece leaving no residual bits behind and continued to rack, then primed and bottled. I've seen no obvious issues with the beer so far - it has bottle fermented and is currently conditioning. One I tested seemed OK considering it was very new, and I had no ill effects! Sadly I didn't get a photo.</p>

<p>I'm just wondering what this is likely to have been? A small infection? Some by-product of fermentation lurking at the bottom of the FV? Something to do with the tap on my primary FV perhaps - I used this tap to take samples and wonder if beer left in the tap could've got infected?</p>

"How to approach unknown hops?","<p>I will have about 1kg of wild hops, gathered last week and frozen. It's wild, but probably it's genotype contains Lubelski (closely related to Saaz), Marynka (bittering hop), and who knows what else.</p>

<p>I want to use it. I will use it. But I wonder - what kinds / styles of beer to brew with it to have best idea about it next year? I can brew few batches with it, used differently. But what styles to brew to get most information for future use, in case I would have access to it next years? I mean, only brewing Pale Ales will give me information about it's taste and aroma, but no information about how it plays with dark malts, for example. I can't try a significant part of known styles, so which ones to try?</p>

"Considerations for temperature control of a freezer?","<p>I have brewed a few dozen batches of ale, but I'd like to brew a lager and am considering low-cost equipment to purchase. I see many using a chest freezer with a temperature control device (such as described in <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/861/temperature-control-for-fermentation"">this question</a> and <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/865/7873"">this answer</a>), so that's what I'm considering first. </p>

<p>However, <strong>I'm concerned about the reliability of a freezer when ""harshly"" power-cycled</strong> by something <a href=""http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/fermenting-equipment/fermentation-temperature-control/johnson-controls-a419-digital-temp-controller"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">of the style of this device</a>. It plugs in between the outlet and the freezer, and seems to work by turning on or off the freezer by essentially ""plugging in and unplugging"" the freezer to keep the contents in the right temperature range.</p>

<p>On compressor-based systems (refrigerators, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, etc.) <strong>I see warnings against ""harshly"" power-cycling these type of machines</strong>: it seems to imply that plugging and unplugging the system is somehow ""bad"" for unspecified reasons, and (based on the behavior of, e.g., unplugging and re-plugging a dehumidifier) it seems that some systems have some logic to avoid frequently turning on and off the compressor.</p>

<p><strong>Should I be concerned about this at all?</strong> From your experience, <strong>have you seen any reliability (or other) concerns regarding this type of power-cycling?</strong> I'm surprised that I can't find other questions about this, so perhaps I'm just over-thinking this.</p>

"Primary Fermentation Only Cuased Bubbles for 2 Days","<p>I think the area I fermented in was too warm for my Brewers Best Weizenbier.  About 75 degrees instead of the recommended 68-72.

Now, I have 1 corny keg but in the future, I would like 4 kegs hooked up, my wife also would like a chest freezer for storage. I think I can fit 2 kegs with gas in an under the counter fridge, so I'd need 2 and also this chest freezer. I was looking in the store today at refrigerators and I have found a fridge/freezer that I think I can satisfy everyone with! I can fit 4 kegs in the top and enough room for gas and a few bottles of ale. And the wife can have the bottom section for storage. This way will save me about £100. </p>

<li>My beer lines will be a little longer, probably 2 meters, will this

<li>Can I store the gas bottle outside of the fridge? Or does the
CO2 have to be chilled also?</li>
<li>Can I cut my hole in the side of a fridge?</li>

"My propane burner is hard to ignite, and when it does, the flames are small","<p>I have a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009JXYQY"" rel=""nofollow"">Bayou Classic KAB4 propane burner</a>, which I've had intermittent success using to bring my wort to a boil. When I hook it up to a full tank it seems to work fine, but when I use a tank that is slightly less than full, it takes several tries for me to ignite it, and when it does, the flames are extremely small - even with careful adjustments to the fuel and air intake valves, the they die quickly. Just to make sure I'm not going completely nuts, when this happens I hook the tank up to my propane grill, and lo and behold, it works perfectly with my grill.</p>

<p>I do notice that when my burner is hooked up to a full tank, I can hear the characteristic propane hiss when I open the valve. With a tank that's <em>mostly</em> full, this hiss is much more faint. (With my grill, the hiss is the same no matter how full the tank is.)</p>

<p>There are no leaks in the hose. I even took the burner into the homebrewing store where I bought it and the guys there couldn't find anything wrong with it. My workaround has been to swap out my propane tank for a full one every time I brew, which has been taking a steady toll on my wallet.</p>

<p>Not sure if this makes any difference, but I brew in an open garage with both the burner and the tank on the ground, roughly at the same elevation. I've seen other brewing setups with the burner elevated. Would elevating the burner above the tank make a difference?</p>

<p>Is there anything else I should check for in my burner, or do I need to modify my setup in some way so my burner will behave more consistently?</p>

"Special considerations for primary fermentation in a carboy?","<p>I brewed my first batch this weekend (Scottish Ale) and have been keeping an eye on it during primary, largely out of curiosity but also first-timer's paranoia.</p>

<p>We added too much water before pitching (lower than expected OG, 1.026-28 vs 1.034-38, and almost no head-space) and as a result it overflowed the airlock on the first night.  Luckily we planned for some overflow and now know to use a blow-off if we're going to do primary in a carboy, or so the Internet says.</p>

<p>That said, I'm still not sure about a few things.  In particular, there's a dark gunk in the neck of the carboy:</p>

"Degassing wine - how to proceed","<p>Long time brewer, first time vintner here.  Working through a winexpert Pinot Grigio kit.  Primary and secondary fermentation went off without a hitch.  Got to the stabilizing, degassing, and clarification last night.  The wine is currently in a 6 gallon glass carboy.</p>

<p>I added the stabilzation chemicals as the directions indicated, and stirred for the 2 minutes, as the directions indicated.  I was using a mix-stir gizmo, hooked up to an electric drill.  For these first two minutes, right or wrong (I'm beginning to think wrong), I was stirring full blast with the drill.  Lots of gas came out. I added the clarification chemicals and stirred, full blast for 2 more minutes.  A lot of gas came out again.  I did the ""puff test"" at this point, using the thief to fill a hydrometer test tube about halfway, sealed the lid with my hand, shook it, and released my hand (instructions say puff - still dissolved gas, no puff - you're good to go).  I got a puff.</p>

<p>At this point I was thinking that I probably aerated the wine, and may need to stir slower.  I did some research and began stirring slowly on and off over the course of the next 1.5 hours until stirring no longer produced foam the way it had earlier.  At this point, it was producing very very little foam if any.</p>

<p>My questions are:  </p>

<p>Did the over-zealous mix-stirring damage the wine?
If the wine is not degassed (never did the puff test again after the 1.5 hour degassing marathon), how shall I proceed?  What is a standard timeframe for letting the wine degas naturally?  I am in no rush.</p>

"Ideal fermentation temperature","<p>I'm just finishing up a DIY fermentation chamber made from a chest freezer, reptile tank heater, and a temperature controller.</p>

"Did I correctly add fruit flavour to my beer?","<p>On a whim, I decided to make a raspberry flavoured IPA. I bought a pre-made wort and some liquid malt extract. </p>

<p>Basically, I boiled about 1.5L of water with some raspberries in one of those hop mesh socks. The water got some nice color and a nice smell. Then I added another 0.5L of water and the wort. I mixed the whole thing for about 2 minutes, then I added the liquid malt extract. After a little more mixing I added the mixture to my primary fermenter (pail) and filled it to the top with cold water.</p>

<p>It's currently sitting at 26.5C (a little warm but still within the range given by the wort's instructions). My OG reading was 1.035.</p>

<p>My big issue with this though is the raspberries, did I add them at the right time? Should I have added more? Should I also add some during secondary fermentation?</p>

</ul>

<p>I realize that I've been lucky and have not had any bad batches thusfar (other than from obvious brewer error), but I think my fermentation is stuck.  I have no clue how to revive a stuck fermentation, how do I proceed?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Tested pH and I think it was below 3.2.  The color was closest to 3.2 but did not match either 2.8, 3.2, or 3.6.  I figure I have a pH of either 3.4 or 3.0, but my gut tells me from looking at the color chips and comparing to the color or my test paper that it's 3.0.</p>

<p>So, either my pH is on the bottom end of acceptable, or is too acidic to ferment.  How do I raise the pH?  Do I pitch another package of yeast (since it's been almost 7 months since pitching the first time)?  Do I add more nutrient/energizer?</p>

However, the yeast did not just float at the top like it usually does when used dry, instead some was suspended in the must and some even ended up at the bottom.</p>

"Measuring yeast activity by collecting CO2","<p>I've been thinking about ways to measure the progress of the primary fermentation, looking for an alternative to taking samples and measuring the gravity.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has tried to predict the amount of alcohol produced by capturing the CO2 and measuring its volume? </p>

<p>It seems like this should be simple to achieve, you'd just need to run a tube from the primary into a graduated cylinder/bottle submerged in water. As the CO2 enters the bottle, water is forced out, and you can measure the volume easily. It should be possible to calculate the amount of alcohol that has been produced given the volume of CO2 that's been released.</p>

"Why does the temperature of bottle conditioning determine the amount of priming sugar?","<p>When using CO2 calculators or the <a href=""http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter11-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">nomograph on Palmer's site</a> we see that depending on the temperature of your beer, you use a different amount of priming sugar in order to get the same effective carbonation.  Why would temperature effect the amount of CO2?</p>

<p>My (incorrect) logic goes like this:  You put ""X"" number of yeast cells into a bottle with ""Y"" amount of food.  When the yeast are done, you have ""Z"" CO2.  So if you do two bottles, both with X and Y counts, and one bottle is warmer, then all of the food might get consumed sooner (presuming both temperatures are keeping the yeast happy), and you get Z CO2.  But the cooler bottle, once all the food is gone, should also have Z CO2, not Z plus something.</p>

<p>So what is going on that changes the food to CO2 ratio when temperature changes?</p>

"What is the purpose of boiling wort?","<p>Theoretical question here.</p>

<p>What happens when wort is boiled? Why do we do it? Why is the process not done at cooler temperatures?</p>

<p>My limited understanding, with some assistance from <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/is-a-long-boil-with-extract-necessary"">this post</a> and <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/3503/what-causes-wort-darkening-in-the-kettle"">this post</a>, is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pasteurization</li>
<li>Maillard reactions, Melanoidin formation, possibly some caramelization</li>
<li>Isomerization of hop acids</li>
</ul>

<p>But I'm not confident that's the whole story. I know why #1 is important, I can guess at why #2 is important, and I assume #3 is important because all homebrewing instructions tell you to do it.</p>

<p>The genesis of my question is the discovery of this little beastie:
<a href=""http://www.williamswarn.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.williamswarn.com/</a></p>

<p>(I have no intention of buying one. It's just an item of curiosity.)</p>

<p>The kits they sell include LME (presumably pre-hopped) and DME, with dry yeast. The instructional video on the home page show the procedure as putting hot-but-not-boiling water in the machine and then adding the extract and the yeast right on top of it before closing the lid. No boiling of the malts at all. That generates the question: why is wort boiled?</p>

<p>One would presume that these extract kits are pasteurized, removing that part of the boil equation. Digging further in the web site reveals recommendations for doing partial mash; steeping specialty grains and hops (in separate pots) before adding to the machine. There's even a reference to all-grain brewing, assumedly a mash conducted before adding wort to the machine, which led me to the conclusion that the WilliamsWarn is not a brewing machine per se, but rather an automated fermenter with integrated carbonation and serving. But I digress.</p>

<p>So what is the difference in procedure between a normal homebrew process and this machine which allows them to get away without a boil? What purpose does the boil serve us?</p>

"Fermwraps and Contact with Towels or Cardboard ** Safety Question","<p>I have four carboys in the closet and four in my bedroom on account of doubling production. The carboys in the bedroom have towels wrapped around them to prevent sunlight from hitting them.</p>

<p>I ought to purchase better drapes, but in the meantime, is it ok for me to wrap a Fermwrapped carboy in a towel? Edit: I am referring to safety and efficiency.</p>

<p>Edit: Another thought: I have all the cardboard boxes which the carboys came in. Can I place them upside down over the carboy if it is wrapped in a fermwrap? (it is tall enough to fit the airlock).</p>

<p>Here is what I am worried about the most:</p>

<p>I am using a Raspberry Pi with a commercial relay device (PowerSwitch Tail II) to monitor the temperature of the beer and turn on and off the Fermwrap if the temperature of the wort gets too low or too high, respectively.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of programming it so that:</p>

<p>I initially set the minimum temperature to 30% of the ""optimal temperature range"" and the maximum temperature to 40% of that range, meaning the fermwrap will turn on if the temperature is under 30%, and turn off if over 40%. </p>

<p>In the event that the temperature of the wort goes way higher than I anticipated due to the insulation effect of the towel/cardboard, the minimum and maximum range should decrease by 5%.</p>

<p>In the event that the temp of the wort goes too low, increase the minimum and maximum by 5%.</p>

<p>I'm worried that if I don't program this correctly, the temperature of the fermwrap could possible get too hot and a) ruin the beer; but more importantly b) present a firehazard to the towel or to the cardboard.</p>
"
"At what point on a Yeast's Optimal Temperature Range should the power to a Fermwrap be turned off?","<p>I finally hooked a PowerSwitch Tail II up to my Raspberry Pi and Fermwrap. The RPi has DS18B20 temperature probes directly measuring the temperature of the wort by going down through the airlock.</p>

<p>For this particular yeast strain, Northern Brewer recommends its optimal temperature range as 66-74°F (18.9-24.3°C).</p>

<p>What I did was subtract 66 from 74 to get 8. I rather arbitrarily chose that the fermwrap should be turned on when the temperature is lower than the bottom 30% of the range -- (8 * 0.3) + 66 = 68.4°F, and the Fermwrap should be turned off when the temperature is hotter than 60% of the range -- (8 * 0.6) + 66 = 70.8°F  ---------- This is 20.2°C and 21.6°C respectively.</p>

<p>I left the house for several hours and came back to find the brew at 74.8°F -- 0.8°F over. The Fermwrap was turned off as it should have been (I am assuming it turned off exactly at 70.8°F). Yet the temperature increased way more than I had intended it.</p>

<p>I figured that by cutting the Fermwrap off at 70.8°F, and given that the ambient temperature was dropping as it was getting later into the night, that the carboy's temperature would not have kept increasing.</p>

<p>What point should I cut the Ferwrap off? Is 60% of the scale too high?</p>

<p>Could the fact that I am surrounding the carboy and the fermwrap with a towel (to block sunlight) have anything to do with it?</p>

"What are the consequences of a ""weak"" boil?","<p>I am new to homebrewing and am getting help from an experienced brewer. So far I think everything has gone OK. I am doing all-grain brewing on a stovetop. I have done 2 brews. I am doing the mash and boil in a 15 gallon kettle. As far as the mash, I have had no problem hitting my target saccharification rest temp and can hold it there (within about <code>+-</code> 3°) for 60 minutes. However when attempting the boil I have run into somewhat of a problem. I can't quite reach a rolling boil. I can only hit about 210° with the lid off. And over the length of the boil, the temp slowly decreases to about 205°. If I leave the lid on, I can hit a nice rolling boil. For future brews, I plan on having a smaller amount of liquid in the kettle and will leave the lid on. Once I noticed I can get a much better boil with the lid it was too late to brew that way because I had about 6.8 gallons in my kettle and needed some of it to evaporate so I can get down to about 5.5 gallons.</p>

<p>So my question is this: What are the chemical, taste, etc. consequences of doing a ""weak"" or ""light"" boil at about 210° ? Will I taste a difference? Would an experienced brewer taste a difference? Was it not 100% sterilized?</p>

"First brewing experience, First kit. need advice","<p>Okay, so I got a homebrew starter kit for xmas about 5 years ago.  it contained 23 litres of prepared wort, a primary pail, a secondary glass carboy and nearly all the tools needed.  I still had to get the cleaning stuff though.</p>

<p>Long story short, the kit sat in my parent's basement for the 5 years untouched.  I was careful to put the airlock into the carboy to prevent dust from entering, as I wasn't sure when i would start.</p>

<p>I haven't ever done anything like this, although I've seen a couple people ferment and bottle, and I've read up quite a bit before i started.  I took some notes here and I would like to get your input and advice.  will this batch work out? I know it might not taste perfect....  Will there be any toxins I should be aware of?</p>

<p>So, I started with a ""FestaBrew Blonde Lager"" wort.  it's 5 years old, but I got fresh yeast for it.  I got a ""Lallemand Windsor Yeast"", British -Style Beer Yeast. (0.388oz, expiry 01/2015)  I had asked the clerk at the brew shop what yeast I need for this lager work I had.  He didn't seem responsive, and all I understood from him is that any yeast will work.  With some research I understand now that any yeast SHOULD work.. but it's the yeast and temperature and time which define an ale or a lager.  The yeast I got was an ale yeast, so I'm trying to follow ale methods.</p>

<p>Feb 22 @ 12am - Cleaned and sanitized the primary, and racking tube and my hydrometer and testing cylinder.  Poured in the wort, making sure to create lots of turbulence.  I then siphoned off a small sample to test later.  I boiled some water, poured 100ml into a sanitized glass, and waited for it to cool down to the ideal temperature that the yeast packet called for.  once at 35 Celsius, I added the yeast, and gave it a small stir to dissolve it.  Then I added it to the wort already in the primary, and gave the whole thing a small stir to evenly distribute it.  I then put the lid on and installed the airlock, with sanitizer in the airlock.  One thing I did notice at this point is that the lid didn't have a gasket and so there wasn't an air-tight seal.  I got a little concerned here.  The sample a siphoned off, without the yeast added had a S.G. of 1.045</p>

<p>Feb 22 @ 12pm - No airlock activity, rather it appears to be ""reversing"", or vacuuming.  I burped the pail/airlock to prevent sanitizer from being sucked in. - probably due to the lid not having a gasket.  I could smell beer from the lid edges.  I peeked through the bunghole and it appears to be active.</p>

<p>Feb 23 @ 12pm - No airlock activity, but still having the vacuum effect.  Burped it again.</p>

<p>Feb 23 @ 10:30pm - Peek through bunghole, yeast is active.  Burped the airlock.</p>

<p>Feb 24 @ 7pm - No airlock activity, no vacuum effect.  No need to burp.</p>

<p>Feb 25 @ 9pm - No activity on airlock, racked into carboy.  Small sample gave a S.G. of 1.013, which indicates that there was some kind of activity.  The sample tastes like beer, and smells like beer.  The beer appears quite cloudy which I'm not sure about, and there was sediment in the pail, which I know is normal.  The airlock began to work immediately when i put it in.</p>

<p>Feb 26 @ 6am - Airlock working just fine, cloudyness starting to fall, as there is about 1"" of clear beer at the top.  No yeast foam observed.  Installed stick on temp guage.  It reads about 65F or lower.  Ambient temp is 74F.</p>

I know that's to be expected, but I feel like it's more bitter than I thought and I am paranoid that the whole grain steeping might have released tannins. This is because we let the temp get slightly above 170 for a brief period (maybe 2 minutes - my girlfriend turned the burners up when I wasn't looking). I guess there's no way to know by asking on here. I guess my question in general is: does the wort(?) taste extremely bitter before fermentation vs. after?

"Step Mash Calculation","<p>I just brewed my hefeweizen for the 3rd time. At the time of the first batch I'd read an article that suggested a ferulic acid rest at 110°F to accentuate the banana notes in the aroma.<br>
I mash in a picnic cooler a la @DennyConn and am having issues with the raising the mash temp to the 150s.  </p>

<p>Initial mash is 11.75 lbs of grain and 2.9 Gal. of water @116°F.  I hit the temp fine and let it rest 20 mins.  At 20 mins, I added 3.8 Gal. of water at 170°F and only hit 140°F.</p>

<p>I used the strike temp calculator at <a href=""http://www.homebrewing.com/calculators/?page=tools&amp;section=strike&amp;action=entry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Homebrewing.com</a> with the  following data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grain Mass - 34 lbs (2.9 Gal. water (@8.5lb/Gal) + 11.75 lbs) </li>
<li>Grain temp - 110°F </li>
<li>Water amount 3.8 Gal. </li>
<li>Target Mash 152°F</li>
</ul>

<p>I verified using a different calculator and got similar results.  What am I missing?</p>

<p>Also, BeerSmith showed that I needed to use 189°F water for the sac rest and I ignored it in lieu of my regular calculator.</p>

"Higher temperature during first two days after pitching yeast","<p>I am brewing for the first time. It is a Chinook IPA. The yeast that came with the kit is Safale US-05. I brewed and pitched it on July 4th in the afternoon. The primary fermentation time is 2 weeks as per instructions.</p>

<p>Though the instructions have a temperature range mentioned against the yeast -  I didn't realize that this is the ambient temperature range I need to maintain while fermentation takes place. I learnt later in the night that it's better to maintain a temperature between 62F and 70F and anything above 72 risks esters and off flavors. I checked the fermometer on the side of carboy in the night and it read 76F-78F. Yikes! I immediately wrapped a couple of wet shirts around the carboy and turned up my AC and that brought it down to 74-75. Then I ordered an insulation bag for the carboy into which I can put ice packs and bottles that will bring the temperature down to range I need. The bag won't arrive till tomorrow - July 6th. My question is- 
1) when is the most important time for fermentation? Am I already too late? I already have a thick Krausen within 18 hours of pitching. </p>

<p>2) will bringing the temperature down now control the hot alcohol  / off flavors? </p>

<p>Also, I didn't check the temperature when I pitched the yeast.  I'm quite sure it wasnt too warm because I had cooled my wort down in a water bath and added cold water to the carboy + cold water on top to bring the water level up - the tap water is quite cold even in summer where I live. I have a robust fermentation going with constant bubbles in the airlock and a 1.5 inch krausen already. </p>

"How to increase gravity / decrease amount of water in my wort, and extract the same amount of sugars?","<p>I have this problem: I'm regularly achieving 90% efficiency with my mash and sparge, and I like this effect. But I usually end up with about 30 ~ 35 liters when I aim for 20 ~ 22 liters. Boil to reduce water takes long time. So I need to reduce amount of water used without loss of sugars. How can I do it?</p>

<p>My current procedure, shown on most recent example:</p>

<p>I took 6kg of malt (weighted when dry), wet-crushed it, and mashed it in water. Total volume of malt + water was about 20 ~ 22 liters. I received about 13~15 liters of first wort at 18 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">°Bx</a>. Then, before my filter bed got anything near dry,  I started to pour sparge water. I ended up sparge at 2 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">°Bx</a>, ending up with a total of 35 ~ 37 liters. I didn't mix it up right away, because I don't have pot large enough, so can't tell exact gravity, but at the end I got bit under 22 liters at 17.2 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">°Bx</a> - perfectly consistent with BrewTarget (expectation was 22 liters at 17.1 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">°Bx</a>).</p>

<p>Any way to recreate this result without getting to boil away 15 liters of water? Where I might went wrong?</p>

<p>Note - dry vs wet crushing does not change anything in that regard. Wrote it just for completness.</p>

<p>For sparge and filtering, I'm using this:</p>

<p>I used for my first batch:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 liter cider </li>
<li>3 tbs honey </li>
<li>Enough yeast for 1 gallon ( due to having no way to measure it accurately)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's been sitting for 7 days not with little bubbles still filling my balloon. </p>

<ul>
<li>1 gallon cider </li>
<li>1 packet of yeast ( good for a gallon)</li>
</ul>

<p>It has been sitting for about 4 days and is very bloated the bottle ( being that it's plastic and the other ones glass).</p>

<p>This one doesn't have any balloon on it just a cap sealing it.</p>

<p>When will I know if they're done?</p>

<p>How do I bottle them correctly with still allowing them to have some carbonation? </p>

<p>If I pasteurize them will that kill the possibility of having it carbonated when I bottle it? </p>

"Possible wild yeast contamination?","<p>In May I brewed the following beer:</p>

<ul>
<li>81% Pale 2 row malt</li>
<li>16% Brown malt</li>
<li>3% Black malt</li>
</ul>

<p>Single step mash at 73C.</p>

<p>With 290g of hops for a total of 103 IBUs.</p>

<p>The OG was 1.077 and it went into primary fermentation at around 18C on 9th May. With an old vial (around 1 year after the best used date) of WLP007 Dry English Ale (I made 2x 1.5l starters for it).</p>

<p>So on the 16th May i checked again and it dropped to 1.036, waited and on the 5th June it still was at 1.036 (figured the fermentation was finished?) so I racked into the secondary and added 50g of Burbon soaked oak chips.</p>

<p>On the 27th of June I racked it of the oak chips as the beer already had a heavy tanninic/woody/unpleasant note.</p>

<p>As I didn't have any space in the cellar I moved it into the flat and stood there (no bottles for filling) at around 23C. </p>

<p>And then the fermentation started again. The airlock got activity and by the 9th of September dropped down to 1.009.</p>

<p>Now 9th of October it went down to 1.006 and activity is still present.</p>

<p>So I was wondering what happened? It is a very attenuative yeast but down to 1.004 should not happen especially with the high mash temperature.</p>

<p>So possibly contamination with a wild yeast? The beer is at the moment quite hash, but at that IBU and alcohol content with not much sugar left it is no wonder.</p>

<p>I thought about waiting for the residual fermentation to stop and then adding lactose to get some sweetness back in?</p>

"What types of artificial sweetener are normally used in fruit cider in the UK & US?","<p>Since yeast will generally eat any sugar you add to your must/cider, adding sugar for sweetness in home-brewing isn't really an option unless you get more elaborate and pasteurise, etc. So artificial sweeteners are the obvious option to allow bottle-conditioned sparkling cider with sensible ABV and a nice level of sweetness... especially the modern trend of sweet ""fruit ciders"".</p>

I have, however, added 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient on brew day. </p>

<p>I've been checking the amount of carbonation every day and the bubbles have been very small and not very intense. The liquid is very cloudy (probably due to the ludicrous amounts of yeast I put in) and the airlock bloops have pretty much stopped after a week. After inspecting it closer and messing around with the airlock a bit, I think i may have caused a small crack around the rim of the airlock cap. It seems like it is still likely air tight, but who knows. </p>

<p>So.... The questions I have for you experienced cider home brewers:
Is it likely the sugars were eaten by the yeast at a expedited rate and my brew has almost fermented weeks in advance due to the excessive yeast? Or do I have an airlock problem? Or is it going super slow because I didn't prepare the yeast better?</p>

<p>I'm considering getting a new airlock and seeing how the process continues, unless I've completely botched my first batch like a newbie. In that case I would like to start over, but any input helps! Thanks yall.

<p>The part that involves fermentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put 2 cups of cherries in a really large jar with a cup of sugar. Do not pit the cherries, she warned, because the pits are critical to the fermentation process. Let the fruit and sugar ferment for 2 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has anyone tried this before? I'm thinking about doing this but I'm concerned that just putting cherries into water with sugar could easily get mouldy. Should I add some yeast too, to ensure that it ferments correctly? I'm guessing this recipe depends on wild yeast but I've never had any luck with that.</p>

<hr>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>So I'm trying this out. After about a week, the sugar had drawn out all of the moisture of the cherries so now the wrinkly cherries are floating in this thick, pinkish syrup. I hadn't expected it to go as fast as it did - it probably went so fast because it's been unusually warm in the apartment this week. There's a very slight ""sharpness"" to the smell which <em>might</em> be the product of fermentation, but the taste is very sweet and I can't taste any alcohol. When I opened the jar today, it sounded like there was a bit of gas escaping. I might let it sit in the fridge for the second week, before I add the vodka.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Update 2</h3>

<p>I am making it again this summer (2013), and this time I am <em>very</em> certain there is some kind of natural fermentation taking place. There are many tiny bubbles all along the edge of the jar, at the top of where the cherries are. The bubbles only started appearing after about 90% of the sugar was dissolved. There's a distinctive sound of pressure being released when I open the lid on the jar, and it smells like it's fermenting (but not in a bad way). I think this time I will wait until the bubbles stop forming before I add the vodka, but I'm wondering if there's any way to estimate (based on the amount of sugar and sour cherries) how much alcohol is going to be produced by this natural fermentation...</p>

So couldn't one take a yeast slurry, measure its weight and volume and use this measure of density to determine what percentage of the mass is composed of yeast, and what percentage is composed of water?</p>

<p>Clearly, since wort is more dense than distilled water, you may have to wash the slurry first.  But this seems much simpler than whipping out a microscope or doing multiple dilutions.</p>

<p>Should this work?</p>

<p>Note: I'm talking about measuring the number of yeast cells in a slurry, not their viability or vitality.</p>

"Any way to rescue an overly bitter beer?","<p>My latest batch of IPA has come out really unpleasantly bitter, it was only supposed to be about 45 IBUs, using a combination of Northdown, Target and Bobek for bittering (60 minutes) and some more Bobek at flame out and for dry hopping.  But I think I may have messup up somewhere as it tastes like it's much much higher than that...</p>

<p>I've not bottled it yet (it's still in the secondary - been there for a couple of weeks), so I was wondering if there was a way I could rescue this batch, or at least make it more pleasant to drink?</p>

<p>Is there something I could add to the secondary, prior to bottling?</p>

<p>Should I just shove it in the bottles and age it for a while to see if it mellows out?</p>

<p>If it's still too harsh after aging, would it be worth trying to blend it with another beer to counteract the over the top bitterness?  If yes, what do you suggest, something more malty?</p>

<p>Here's the details on the hops as requested in the comments...</p>

<ul>
<li>Northdown (8.1% AA) - 23g at 60min</li>

My chilling solution isn't working as well as I'd hoped, and it's currently around 60F after about 16 hours - I've just got some bubbling in the blowoff.

"Is leaving some cider in the primary bad?","<p>When bottling my cider (FG 1.000) I ran out of bottles and saw this as an opportunity to flavour the remaining third and try racking.</p>

<p>I added some boiled cinnamon and clove then left it for a day while I got around to purchasing a second carboy.  It occurred to me that this may have been bad when the cider turned brown and, I swear, developed a heavier mouth feel.  I suspect drawing in oxygen through my water lock as I bottled may have started it turning to vinegar.  Could this or anything else bad happen so quick?  (we used apples from our tree with no potassium metabisulphate)</p>

<p>To rescue the situation, I racked the 5 litres to a smaller carboy, begrudgingly adding half a tablet of potassium metabisulphate to kill off anything bad and added a small amount of brown sugar to initiate a small secondary ferment to push the O2 out of the head.

"Needs to be mashed","<p>I recently had a debate with a brewing buddy of mine about malts that ""need to be mashed"".
For instance victory malt is listed in Palmers ""How to Brew"" as being in the needs to be mashed column.  I can understand that there are unconverted starches in the malts and mashing them makes fermentable sugars, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Base malt certainly needs to be mashed because it normally consists of 80-100% of the grist.  But if you were putting victory malt in at the rate of 5% or less.  What starch load would you really get?   If you made a base wort and steeped 5% of victory in a 6 gallon batch would a starch test even show positive?  What does it matter at such a low amount.</p>

"Why did my Oktoberfest turn out so light?","<p>I recently did my first batch of beer: Oktoberfest (True Brew kit).  Brewed up the wort, fermented and bottled to a T.

I was certain I had done everything right according to the recipe and had achieved a great beer. </p>

<p>Upon tasting I was slightly disappointed by a less characteristic light flavor.  I'm wondering what I did in the process to cause this?  The beer is not bad, just not at all what I expected, very bland.  Perhaps it's the brew kit itself? I usually expect my Oktoberfest's to have a richer full bodied flavor while this Oktoberfest drank more like a very light bodied smooth Amber Ale.  </p>

<p>Some important notes: The gentleman at the home brew supply store switched out the initial Lagering yeast of the kit and replaced with an ale yeast so it could be fermented and bottled as an Ale would be versus as a Lager at cooler fermentation.  My wort was more concentrated, I believe 2 gallons in full, and then added to 3 gallons of water.  Fermented for 9 days, aged in bottle for another 10.  </p>

<p>For my Doppelbock 7.0, this Sunday will make it 3 weeks in the keg for fermentation. The previous beer I made was a pale ale, and I let that one ferment 3 weeks also, and waited to bottle until the surface cleared up.

I assumed it to be yeast colonies, but unlike the yeast colonies for the pale ale, these spots haven't changed since I noticed them. They haven't grown or shrunk. Is this yeast? Is it bacteria? Should I wait to bottle it until it goes away? Is the beer infected? I tasted it, and it didn't have any horrible flavors, though I did notice a decent amount of hop particles in the glass. Is that something that will settle as I bottle condition it? I have been able to keep the temperature between 66 and 68 degrees throughout, except that the first 2 days it was at 56 degrees.</p>

I'm considering moving the fermenter (plastic bucket type) from my kitchen down to the basement for a few days in the hope that the lower temperature will improve the clarity of the beer.</p>

<p>How risky is it to move the fermenter near the end of fermentation?  I'm worried that moving it down the stairs will cause sloshing and aeration, or disturb the trub and nullify any clarifying effect from the chilling.  I added a Whirlfloc tablet near the end of the boil, does that reduce the benefit of cold crashing?</p>

"Does Dry Hopping create a white film with bubbles?","<p>Might be a weird question!</p>

<p>I have brewed, with a friend, 6 batches of beer so far. An IPA, then a Stout, a Saison, a Doppelbock, an Baltic Porter and finally, the same IPA. All grain, always.</p>

<p>Of all these, only twice we had that weird white film over the beer in the carboy, in the second fermentation. It comes with a few white bubbles. there are some lines of that white that are traced, a little bit like a spider web.</p>

"Does skunking only occur after fermentation starts or finishes?","<p>I've had discussions with other home brewers who claim that a bi-product (which I've admittedly since forgotten what exactly it was) of fermentation conflicts with the hops to cause skunking of beer.  I've always thought that skunking happens immediately after the beer goes into the carboy, but then it occurred to me that so many brewers are doing their hop additions outside on a burner in broad daylight.  Where is the line drawn?  Does ultraviolet rays cause skunking from the minute they're added to the boil kettle?  Does the beer have to ferment (or begin fermenting) in order for the beer to become skunked?  What is the scientific reason behind beer getting skunked?</p>

"IBU above 100... how bad is that?","<p>First of all, I didn't really plan to make a beer with IBU above 100... I popped the hops into the calculator and it came out about 85.

I recalculated the IBU according to my steps, and it came out as 120 (that is what happens when you put Magnum and Columbus at 60mins of boil). </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not against hops, and I love hoppy IPAs and DIPAs with tons of hops (I'm a hophead and an addict, I know). However, I've read that a human won't be able to taste bitterness of IBU above 100... In other words IBU 100 and IBU 150 would taste the same... Is it the case? </p>

<p>Will it be bad? Can I neutralize the over-bitterness with any additional ingredients into secondary like oak cubes, maltodextrin, caramel or crystalized honey? Or I just should not worry about it and just enjoy it like an extra bitter IPA?</p>

"Will blending a highly attenuating yeast with a highly alcohol tolerant yeast cleanly lower the final gravity in a very high gravity ale?","<p>I've brewed some ridiculous beers in the past, my highest original gravity resulting in over a final 18% ABV using WLP099 yeast.  That particular beer turned out well for how inexperienced I was when I decided to go crazy with that, but I wanted to revisit the idea.  My thoughts were to try and brew a crazy, Quadruple IPA (I totally just made that style up, since some commercial breweries have brewed up to whatever they defined as their ""Triple IPA"").  In order to get anywhere near the distinguishable hop character, I need to get the final gravity low.  My intent is to have at least a 15% ABV beer, with well over 100 IBUs, and no higher than a 1.016 final gravity.  I'm hopeful that 1.016 is just enough body, that it will assist the hops with masking the alcohol.</p>

<p>The obvious concerns that I should be able to deal with are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mash tun capacity </li>
<li>Expenses for all the grain and dextrose </li>
<li>Several aerations throughout primary fermentation</li>
<li>Controlling fermentation temperatures to subdue esters and alcohol burn</li>
</ol>

<p>What I am uncertain of is how to ensure I get a clean fermentation out of it.  What I initially had in mind was to start the fermentation with an adequate dosage of <a href=""http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp090-san-diego-super-yeast"" rel=""nofollow"">White Labs' San Diego Super yeast (WLP090)</a>, of which I'm a <em>huge</em> fan of for clean ale strains.  I would pitch a sufficient starter to see the entire fermentation through.  According to Mr. Malty, for 6 gallons at 1.130, that's 2 vials at 2.66 liters (using a stir plate).  This would ensure that I have at least enough of WLP090 to pull me through should it need to.</p>

<p>The catch is, I'd also blend in any equally sized starter of <a href=""http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp099-super-high-gravity-ale-yeast"" rel=""nofollow"">White Labs' Super High Gravity Ale Yeast (WLP099)</a> approximately 72-96 hours into the fermentation.  I figure at this high of a gravity, over-pitching is better than under-pitching, and I can make up for the lost IBUs by throwing more hops at it.  I've noticed that the ester profile of WLP099 increases at high gravity, and I want the IPA to be hop forward instead of ester forward.  That's why I'd allow the ester-subdued WLP090 handle the majority of the work, and allow the WLP099 finish up what the WLP090 couldn't.</p>

<p>My questions regarding this are, when taking this approach, using a 2 vial/2.66L starter of WLP090 at the start, and another equally sized starter of WLP099 at the 72-96 hour mark, will the ester profile remain subdued, will the beer still ferment low given how the WLP099 will likely out-ferment the WLP090, and are there any complications I haven't outlined above that will throw a wrench in the bucket?  Will the lesser alcohol tolerant ale strain cleanly ""crap out"" when it hits its max or will it throw crazy, unwanted esters?  Would I just be better off using one of the two strains?  Is the attenuation of WLP099 going to be negatively affected by allowing WLP090 to chew on the wort beforehand?  Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

"Fermentation Schedule on a Biere de Garde","<p>-TLDR version of the questions:  How long could/should you keep fermented beer on the yeast at 72 degrees after reaching an appropriate final gravity before racking/bottling to minimize off-flavor compounds (I’m particularly gunshy about diacetyl and acetaldehyde)?</p>

<p>-Does biere de garde benefit from cold-crashing, and if so, can I cold crash on the yeast, or do I need to rack to a carboy?</p>

<p>I brewed a 55 gallon batch of biere de garde with my homebrew club this past Saturday.  We came out a little light on FG (1.061, compared to recipe target of 1.068), and also had an issue with our plate/pre-chiller set up, and only got most of the wort down to the mid-70’s/low-80’s.  We split up the wort (each guy got 5 gallons).  I had to leave early, and the guy who hosted pitched a cup of Brewer’s Art Resurrection (dubbel) yeast at about 75 degrees, and kept it in his basement, ambient temp of about 70.  Came back a day later, fermenter temp was about 75 with vigorous airlock activity.  Took my fermenter and another for a fellow member and put them in my ferm chest, and dialed back the temperature.  Per Jamil’s recipe, I set the controller to 66 degrees, and placed the probe on the outside of my fermenter (ale pail) with styrofoam/tape on the outside to insulate it from the ambient temp inside the ferm chest.  </p>

<p>Jamil says to raise the fermentation temp by one degree or so per day once fermentation slows until you are at 72.  As I noticed airlock activity slowing (I didn’t take a gravity reading) two nights ago, I let it creep up to 67, then 68 last night.  I plan to take a gravity reading tonight.  Also, in Chris White’s book, he notes that a great technique achieve proper attenuation is to pitch on the warmer side (mid/high-70’s), let fermentation start, then ratchet it back to your desired temp (as we did here, somewhat accidentally).  The only caveat is that if you do this, you need to raise the temp back up at the end of fermentation to clean up these compounds.  </p>

<p>Here are my questions: I have been operating under the wisdom that as homebrewers, we should not take beer off the yeast for at least 2 weeks.  Even if the krausen subsides and FG is reached, leaving the beer on the yeast can ONLY benefit the beer (autolysis seems to be less of a concern with today’s yeast strains).  However, I am new to temp control, and I know commercial brewers regularly have primary fermentations in the 6-7 day range.  Also, I would like to cold crash this for at least a month.  Should I take it off the yeast before doing so? </p>

My question is, can I kick start the fermentation at this point to knock off a few more points? I would ideally like to end up around 1.010. I've tried swirling the bucket to stir up the yeast a little, but I don't want to go crazy and accidentally oxidize or taint it at this point. Here are some things I was considering:</p>

"Can wort layering significantly affect OG reading?","<p>A few days ago I brewed a 5-gallon recipe with the following fermentables:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 oz Crystal 20</li>
<li>8 oz Crystal 40</li>
<li>One 3.3 lb can Briess Munich LME</li>
<li>2.5 lb Light LME</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://beercalculus.hopville.com/recipe"" rel=""nofollow"">Beer Calculus</a> predicts an OG of 1.046.</p>

<p>For the first time in years, I got distracted for a moment and there was a boil-over. This is an annoying complication to my question (which is coming below). I don't believe too much was lost during the boil-over. I know I started with about 1.5 gallons of water when I mashed the grains. After removing the (waterlogged) grains and sparging with maybe a quart of water, I added the syrups. After the boil-over, I noted that I still had about 1.5 gallons in the pot. Now, having cleaned up the mess, I'd say about a pint of wort was lost to my stove top. When I consider the water that would have been removed with the grains, I feel like these numbers add up, but I'll let the experts weigh in on that. If I'm right about losing a pint when there were 2 gallons total, that would reduce Beer Calculus's OG estimate to about 1.043</p>

<p>So I finished my brewing, and topped off the carboy to 5 gallons. After I pitched the yeast, I took a gravity reading: 1.030. That seems incredibly low! At first, I told myself that the combination of losing some concentrated wort during the boil-over and a low efficiency from the mashing might explain it. So I told myself whatever happens will happen with this batch, and I went to bed.</p>

<p>But this morning I had another memory/realization. My girlfriend and I both noticed a ring about 1/3 of the way up in the carboy after the brewing. It was a ring of particulate inside the wort. I thought that was neat - there was a little meteorogical system in the carboy. Liquid of a heavier density had settled to the bottom and the particulate was floating on top of it. Possibly relevant - I used Irish moss in this batch (1/2 tsp for 10 min) which I do not normally use.</p>

<p>So I wonder: could my low OG reading be (in significant part) because I sampled from the top, where the less dense liquid was? Or is this just wishful thinking? I've never before seen the layering I saw with this batch. Does anyone else see that in their recipes?</p>

"Carbonated in carboy from primary fermentation?","<p>I recently brewed a batch and let it set in the carboy for 2 weeks. When it was transfered to the bottling bucket we noticed that it was a little carbonated already, which seemed odd. We ignored it and proceeded on to keg it like normal.</p>

<p>It measured a FG of about 1.002. Which was another red flag but it was not insanely lower than the <a href=""http://hopville.com/recipe/1519282/american-wheat-or-rye-beer-recipes/rye-ale"" rel=""nofollow"">projected</a> 1.008.</p>

<p>The really odd part was when sugar was added to the keg for it to prime. Right when the sugar was poured into the beer it started overflowing the keg, and sort of foamed but mostly just gushed out, and was pretty neat/messy. </p>

<p><strong>Any ideas what could have caused this effect?</strong></p>

<p>We tasted the beer used to calculate the FG and it tasted good. No noticeable off flavors. One thought was that we did mash at 144, but I don't see how that could effect the carbonation. </p>

<p>Since I am writing this question a few days after the case and have had time to think I wondered if it could have been that the 3 piece was partly blocked from foam but not enough to push it off? I did not notice any hiss, or oddities from the 3 piece when I opened it, although I had ""tasted"" a few brews by that point.</p>

<p>EDIT: fixed FG to take temp into account.</p>

"Using a low alcohol tolerance yeast in potentially high alcohol must","<p>i have posted this question on other forums but haven't really gotten a good answer.</p>

<p>Based on my calculated OG (this may change) I'm looking at 1.122. This is capable of fermenting up to around 15.6% abv. I'd like to stop it around 14-15%. If I use a yeast with a tolerance of 14% (Lalvin 71B or d47), this should leave a significant amount of sugars in the mead by the time the yeast gives out, right? Sugar left means sweet, and the luscious mouthfeel I am looking for.</p>

"Freezer-pack-based cooling","<p>I haven't done any brewing this summer because when I brewed some mead last summer, my apartment was very warm during the days, and I think this higher brewing temperature was related to some solvent-y flavours that some people detected in that batch.</p>

<p>I'd like to start a batch now to be ready later in the fall, but it's still rather warm (gets close to 30C indoors in the daytime) in my apartment. I don't have a budget for a temperature controlled fermenter. I make small batches (5 Litres) and the fermenting jar will fit nicely into a small picnic cooler. My plan was to put a few freezer-packs into an inch of water inside the picnic cooler to lower the temperature overnight and then put the fresh wort in the next day (in contact with the cold water at the bottom to keep it cooler). I imagine I'd have to change the freezer-packs twice a day.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea? I know that the process of fermentation itself will generate a <em>little</em> bit of heat and while I don't <em>think</em> it's enough to overwhelm the freezer-packs and overheat the inside of the cooler, I'm not 100% sure about that. Has anyone used this method before? Does it work (or sound like should work), or should I wait for cooler weather?</p>

"Doppelbock fermentation and lagering question!","<p>Iv'e got a Doppelbock 1.090 brewed 7/19. Pitched the Whit Labs ""X"" at 60 deg. Placed the  carboy in the fridge (first time trying a lager fermentation). Two days later the beer was at 44-46(thats the highest temp I can get my fridge), fermentation was ok (again I'm used to ale temp fermentation), krausen was in between an inch and a half of an inch. I currently use a ""blow-off"" and the air bubble was always below the water level but never at the bottom of the tube. On the 31st (12 days later) my gravity was 1.050 so I decided to warm up the sluggish(?) fermentation by taking it out and wrapping it in a blanket (slow warm-up). Well we had a little heat wave here in Washington and according to the stick-on thermometer temp is now at the last square 76 deg. (currently 1.030)</p>

<p>So my question is what can I expect, and what can I do? fermentation was more then 50% complete so at this point, so am I reducing diacetyls quicker at higher temp or did I not take it far enough? I'm assuming putting it back in the fridge isn't going to do me any good.</p>

"Top Cropping Cell Counts","<p>TLDR:  I have no idea how much top-cropped yeast to pitch into a ~1.055 OG Octoberfest (5.5 gallons)</p>

<p>I am planning on making an Octoberfest (late I know) on August 18th.  Instead of making a boring old starter, I decided to spring for some ingredients and use up the Northern Brewer hops in my freezer and make a steam, which I will do on August 10th.  While different from San Fransisco Lager Yeast, Wyeast's bavarian lager has very similar characteristics (and is likely distantly related) to the SF lager yeast typically used in steams.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm planning on making a 1.5L starter + yeast nutrient with the BL yeast (smack pack), pitching in the low 60s for the steam.  Then I am planning on top-cropping as much as I can at high krausen (24-36 hours?) off the steam, harvesting into a sanitized mason jar, and pitching that into my Octoberfest Lager at around 50 degrees.  </p>

<p>this being my first lager, I am obviously worried about stressing the yeast, excessive sulphur production, etc., however the proprietor of my LHBS told me that it was not advisable to pitch onto an existing yeast cake.  I had heard this wasn't a good idea (but not a horrible idea), as there is a lot of other material in this (dead cells, trub, etc.), but he mainly cited the fact that if you overpitch, the cells won't need to grow, and they will actually competitively crowd each other out/kill each other (!).  </p>

<p>I am left with a few alternatives:</p>

<p>1.)  top crop and grow a 1.5-2 L starter for the Oktoberfest
2.)  top crop and pitch as-is (maybe a cup?)</p>

<p>EDIT:  someone on another site just commented that I won't be able to top crop since this is a lager yeast.  aka.  a BOTTOM fermenting yeast.  Even if there is a krausen, it doesn't sound like it will have huge amounts of yeast cells in it.  Maybe I'll just reserve some of my steam starter and do a second starter...making this entire exercise circuitous and pointless.  Gotta love homebrewing!</p>

"Yeast Washing - danger in long seperation times?","<p>I attempted my first yeast washing last night after bottling.

In the morning (about 7 hours later) there was a lot more seperation, but the top layer was much clearer than any of the videos I've watched online.</p>

<p>Given the conditions I would have expected to be closer to FG (1.012-14) after a week. I haven't had such a slow fermentation before, though I haven't used 1010 before, nor do I often brew with honey. I roused the yeast and am now another 2 points down so I know it's not stuck. I'm disappointed because I was hoping to have this beer in the keg by this weekend.</p>

<p>Are there any clues here as to why this fermentation is so slow? I couldn't find any evidence of 1010 being slow, and it seemed so happy the first couple of days. I can only think the problem is in my recipe or process. Maybe after chewing through the honey, the bulk the yeast didn't switch over well to the maltose?</p>

"Will Sparkolloid slow or stop fermentation?","<p>Background: My wife drinks cider like a fish drinks water and buying cider at the store was leaving me pretty much broke. The LHBS turned us on to the idea of making our own a couple years ago so we gave it a whirl. Preservative-free apple juice and a Wyeast Cider smack pack yields a decent dry cider that is super easy to make. The best part about it is that she will drink it without much fussing (She is normally pretty fussy about food and drinks). The worst part about it is that it takes a long time to clear. To get a clear product faster, I tried my hand at adding Sparkolloid when there was probably about 10 gravity points left in fermentation. About 8 hours after the addition, it appears that fermentation slowed significantly, nearly stopping. I'm not talking about just the air lock not bubbling as much. The production of CO2 bubbles coming out of the cider itself has nearly halted. </p>

<p>So - did Sparkolloid have something to do with the slowed fermentation? I'm leaning towards no since I could not find anything supporting this idea on the www, but figured I would ask you experts.</p>

<p>Bonus question - When is an appropriate time to add something like Sparkolloid to wines and ciders? In my beer production, I normally just add Irish Moss near the end of the boil and I've never had a turbid batch.</p>

  brown porter use amber malt as a base malt [2](though this was
  diastatic and produced in different conditions from a modern amber
  malt). Amber malt has a bitter flavor which mellows on aging, and can
  be quite intensely flavored; in addition to its use in porter, it also

<p>Our local homebrew shop, however, was out of Brett but we were able to pick up everything else, thinking we'd just use the pedio. After some additional research though, it seems that Brett is practically seen as a requirement with pedio due to its heavy production of diacetyls.</p>

<p>Should we hold off on brewing until we can get Brett or is there something else we can do to help limit diacetyl production?</p>

<p>Is this something that could be addressed with a diacetyl rest (maybe in combination with pitching additional yeast?)?</p>

"Calculating alcohol percentage after diluting with a sugar syrup","<p>I am making Limoncello, I have added 8 lemon zests to 1 liter of 96% alcohol and put everything in a big glass container.</p>

<p>After 1 month I started making the real liqueur by diluting the alcohol down with a sugar syrup. The sugar syrup consists of a dilution of 800 grams sugar in 1 liter of water.</p>

<p>I've put the big container on a scale, used the tare button to put it to zero. In all my silliness I've decided to use the scale/a weight factor in order to 'measure' my dilution - so I went on and added 1 kilogram of my sugar syrup.</p>

<p>I think that the next time it would be better to measure an amount of 1 liter of sugar syrup instead of 1 kilogram - but I am still thinking about this.</p>

<p>Now I am calculating like crazy, but I cannot really figure it out. The most simple and erroneous calculation would be to say:</p>

<pre><code>1 L alcohol + 1 Liter/Kilogram sugar syrup = 2 Liter/Kilograms
1 L alcohol = 96%
2 L mixture = 96 / 2 = 48%
</code></pre>

<p>But I know this is wrong. I however cannot figure out how and why this is wrong. Diluting alcohol with water will work this way, I guess. But the added parts sugar to the water makes it hard. So the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much alcohol do I have in my mixture?</li>
<li>How do I calculate alcohol percentages after diluting with a certain sugar syrup concentration?</li>

"Recycling Screw-top Bottles for Homebrew","<p>With my budget being somewhat limited I can only really afford to put my wine into sanitised used bottles from store bought wine, rather than proper bottles with corks.

"Fermenting Soda","<p>Years ago I attempted to ferment Mountain Dew (about a decade ago so my recount of the details may be a bit off).  My goal was to have a drink with similar carbonation, similar flavor, and reasonable amount of alcohol.  Talking with some coworkers who were amateur wine makers, they suggested using a champaign yeast.  I took a 5 gallon carboy, filled it most of the way up with Dew, added yeast, and added granulated sugar until it was sugary enough for that particular yeast to thrive.  I don't recall how much sugar was added but I was shocked that the Dew itself didn't register high enough by itself when tested.</p>

<p>When the fermentation was complete, something to make carbonation was added, it was bottled, and put in a cool dark place for a month or so.  When I finally tried it, the results were a bit disappointing.  There was a flat, yeasty, slightly bitter &amp; alcohol taste, but the Dew flavor was almost nonexistent.  All in all it was a fun experiment that I couldn't wait to try again.</p>

<p>My questions is this... I got a Mr. Beer kit as a gift and I thought about trying my ""Dew Brew"" again.  Is there anything I can do to get better results (more of a Mountain Dew flavor with better carbonization)?  Do I need different equipment?  If the problem was that the Dew was already fairly diluted (relative to most pre-fermented liquids) would it work to go get a bag of the syrup that is used in soda fountains?</p>

"Process and timing to detect a stalled fermenation in order to add more yeast (repitch)","<p>Working with a 1.060 original gravity wort, mashed at 152F, and using the WLP565 Dupont yeast (that is known to stall), when should the brewer investigate if adding a secondary strain of yeast will be required?  Is there a rule of thumb or accepted practice that suggests if X% of expected attenuation is not complete by Y days, then attenuation will very likely require a very long time?</p>

<p>Of course there are various options for the brewer, such as raising the fermentation temperature, removing back pressure, or simply waiting for the fermentation rate to start again.  But this question is about the earliest point where the brewer might know with reasonable certainty that action is going to be required to get the beer to quickly completely attenuate, and what to do at that point.</p>

<p>The default process is to take multiple gravity readings, and when the slope doesn't change from one measurement to the next, then it's time to take action.  But is there a way to ""know"", right away, by taking just one, properly timed measurement?  </p>

<p>With this yeast, there are many brewers reporting ""stuck at 1.030"" or ""stalled at 1.035"", which are roughly only 50% or 60% of expected attenuation, but it's usually after a few weeks of frustration and multiple measurements.</p>

"Slight difference pre and post boil gravity","<p>Long story short. Trying to understand my new set up, I made a mistake, I didn't check the post boil volume and also didn't have good rolling boil. The wort was boiling, but not so much. Simple grain bill:  </p>

<p>However, three days later, there are no signs of fermentation (bubbling airlock) in the new batch.

We decided to pitch the yeast anyway and then put it in the fridge. Well, after a month or two it's definitely not good beer based on the hoppy flavors and lack of activity. We added some nutrient and the yeasts woke up for a little bit but died off again shortly after. The evidence points to that we didn't get enough sugars in there somehow.

For this recipe, Jamil says to carbonate the beer, then lager for one month at 45-50F.  I have the ability to do this in my ferm chest, but doing so would mean I can't ferment anything else for that month.  On the other hand, I could put the carbonated bottles into the fridge at 36F for a month before calling them ready to drink.  What is the difference between lagering the conditioned beer at 36F versus 45-50F?

Part of me wants to say he suggest those temps because they're convenient for those who keg: force carbonate, then place the keg in the kegerator, which is typically at 45-50F for serving, and leave it for a month before tapping.  Since I bottle, my serving chamber (the beer fridge), which sits at 36F, is the most convenient place to keep the beer.  If I lager it at 36F, will I be missing the point of lagering at 45-50F?</p>

"How to Properly Increase the Temperature of a Batch after Primary Fermentation","<p>I've read tidbits how that after the first 3 days of fermentation, you would ideally raise the temperature of the carboy for the remainder of the brew.</p>

<p>How, exactly, does one do this?</p>

<p>Say the Wyeast I buy states an optimal temperature range of 60-72*F (15.5 to 22.2*C), and I don't know enough about the flavor profile at different temperatures of a yeast, so I arbitrarily decide that the midway point is going to be my target temperature.</p>

<p>For the first three days I hold the temperature at 66*F (18.9*C).</p>

<p>Given that (I've heard) only 50% of the batch is brewed in the first three days, why would I want to raise at all?</p>

<p>Assuming I want to raise, </p>

<p>1) Do I raise after 3 days or some other amount? (Rule of thumb here as I'm not going to take gravity readings)</p>

<p>2) how much do I raise the temperature by?</p>

<p>3) how many hours/days do I take to raise the temperature?</p>

<p>Now to the question. We used 10.5kg of grain for 26.25 liters of water for the mash. From the recipe calculator, we should have gotten around 1.208 OG. We ""only"" managed to get it to 1.120.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask if anyone had an idea of that poor efficiency. Mash went wonderfully at a temperature of 66°C.</p>

<p>When I brew, so far always from a prepackaged kit, after the steep, I get the boil going, add the steep/rinse water, bring back to boil, add liquid extract, bring back to boil, add hops, boil 60 min, add finishing hops...</p>

"Advice on my second batch","<p>I recently completed my first batch, which was the DIPA kit from Brewer's Best.  It actually turned out much better than I could have imagined, so I was very pleased.  My only complaints, and these were confirmed by friends who tried it, was that while it had a bitter taste, it didn't have a distinctively hoppy taste.  It also had a pleasant aroma, but the aroma was not long lasting.  </p>

<p>The hop profile of the kit was Columbus hops added at 0 min and 45 min of the 60 min boil, and then cascade hops added at the end for aroma.</p>

<p>I want to get a bit creative for my second batch, and try to use this kit again but add in some additional hops.</p>

<p>Based on all of the material I have read, the general rule of thumb is early hops for bittering, middle hops for flavoring, and late hops for aroma.  </p>

<p>What I want to try is the following hop profile (I did some analysis on characteristics of hops, and picked some I think could be interesting);</p>

<p>Bittering Hops - Simcoe and Chinook</p>

<p>Flavoring Hops - Warrior and Columbus</p>

<p>Aroma - Cascade</p>

<p>I then want to dry hop with Glacier and Palisade.</p>

<p>My question is, with this many hop additions, do I boil for more than 60 minutes?  Is there a right or wrong way to make multiple hop additions during a boil?  A set amount of time I should wait between each addition?</p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>

"Does temperature rise time between mash steps matter?","<p>When doing a multi-step mash, does the amount of time you take in between steps to raise the temperature make a difference? (Aside from the obvious ""taking longer will make your brew day take longer""). I've only done multi-step mashes a few times. The first time I basically had my burner on the whole time and let the mash temp raise from about 120°F to 152°F over about the course of an hour. The second time, I let it rest at each step without any heat and heated between steps as quickly as I could manage to stir without scorching. Raising quickly certainly takes less brew-day time, but I can't say I noticed any difference in the final wort (disclaimer: these two mashes were not the same grist, so it wasn't an experimental comparison, so to speak).</p>

<p>Is there something happening on the enzymatic level that I'm not aware of? Does this make a difference only when using under modified grain?</p>

"Force-carbonated Homebrew Keg Foaming","<p>I see there are other keg-foaming questions on here, but they seem to usually be related to commercial kegs or have answers that I've tried (hastily). </p>

<p>I have a keg of homebrew brown ale and a brand new 2-tap Edgestar Kegerator which has a roughly 1ft tall stainless steel tower. We upgraded the hardware on the kegerator to have a manifold between the two CO2 lines as well as threaded disconnects to support either corny keg (ball lock) connectors or commercial kegs. The kegerator has been cold since Monday, and the keg was chilling for 24 hours on Monday/Tuesday in the kegerator before we started force carbonating it.</p>

<p>We are force-carbing it because we have a holiday party on Friday (tomorrow!) and we want to have it ready by then.</p>

<p>Finding various techniques for force-carbing, we ended up going with 20psi for one day and 30psi for another day, with rocking the keg every couple hours in between, before letting the CO2 out of the head space in the keg and getting it back down to 10psi. </p>

<p>We now have the liquid line connected, and nothing but foam is coming out, pint after pint. The beer itself, once the foam fades, is very flat.</p>

<p>Here's what other people have suggested to fix that I've already confirmed are not a problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get it cold - yep, the keg and the beer coming out of it are cold</li>
<li>Use 3/16"" ID tubing - it already came with that</li>
<li>Make sure the lines are cold - they are, and the faucet itself gets cold once it starts flowing</li>
<li>Make sure the lines are long enough - they are about 3', which according to the L = (P - (H x .5) - 1) / R formula they are more than long enough for 10psi</li>
<li>Clean the lines - these are clean, brand-new lines</li>
<li>Make sure the lines don't dip below the top of the keg - they're currently spooled up on top of the keg</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on other answers and other websites, here's what I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting the regulator to zero, clearing CO2 from keg, then slowing raising it back up - no luck at 5, 8, 10, or 12 psi</li>
<li>Crank up the pressure to 10-12psi directly after clearing CO2 from keg - no luck</li>
</ul>

<p>So is there anything I can do to get this ready for tomorrow evening? Is it undercarbonated (since it tastes flat) and the pressure is wrong for pushing it out, or is it overcarbonated and the flat taste is because of the foam? Do I really need to by a tower cooler fan to blow the cold air up into the tower? Or is there no hope for having it ready by tomorrow and we just need to let it sit at 10psi for 2 weeks?</p>

"Troubleshooting new keggerator equipment - sanke tap, gas manifold, etc","<p>I've been using a converted chest freezer for nearly a year now for storing and dispensing from corny kegs and for lagering. Depending on whether I have kegs of homebrew, I may have a sanke keg of commercial brew. </p>

<p><strong>I just added two pieces of equipment to the system: a one-to-three gas manifold and a second sanke tap</strong> and hooked up two sixth barrel kegs from the same brewery. There was a large discrepancy in how the two kegs dispensed -- one was slow, as if there was almost no pressure; the other was way too pressurized and foamy.</p>

<p>When I adjust gas settings at all -- change pressure on the regulator, bleed gas with pressure relief valve, etc. -- the system hums like a harmonica. This may have come from one of the pressure relief valves (on the sanke tap or on the manifold) and seemed to be a red flag. I have not been able to detect any leaks. Upon visual inspection, everything seems fine as well.</p>

<p>My question is this: <strong>Why would these two identical kegs fitted with identical taps filled with beer from the same brewery dispense so dramatically differently?</strong> Does one tap have a defective pressure relief valve? </p>

<p>Secondly, a big BBQ party drained both kegs in a day, so I didn't have much time to troubleshoot. How can I further test this if both kegs are blown?</p>

"Why did fermentation take so long to start?","<p>I boiled and pitched a low-gravity (~1.033) <a href=""http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=143"" rel=""nofollow"">Scottish Ale</a> this past Sunday.</p>

<p>The wort was cooled via immersion to under 75° F and then aerated via a whisk-on-drill contraption before pitching the yeast. The house has stayed at a consistent 75° F the whole time, within range of the yeast's comfort zone. </p>

<p>As of this morning (Wednesday), there was no activity to speak of. Despite verifying the airlock and seals were all tight, it was apparent no pressure had been generated. I removed the airlock and found neither krausen or any yeasty smell--it looked and smelled the same as before I lidded it on Sunday.</p>

<p>When I came home this afternoon, I was about to attempt a re-pitch when I found something rather different. The airlock was bubbling away. I popped the top I found quite a healthy-looking (if a bit dark) krausen, and a definite yeasty smell. Perhaps it wasn't quite the smell I expected (I'm not used to smelling it mid-fermentation), but it certainly smelled more of beer than of wort.</p>

<p>So what was going on the past three days that made the yeast take so long to kick in? Do I need to worry about acquiring an infection during this time without alcohol, and particularly having now opened the lid twice (I'd never opened it before bottling time in the past)? Or should I just relax, not worry, and drink a homebrew?</p>

"Water Volume on Palmer's Spreadsheet","<p>Anyone have any experience with Palmer's Spreadsheet?</p>

<p>The way it was described to me and the way I read and understand it now states that for the water volume in Step 4 you just put the amount of water for the initial mash strike. So for my purposes right now only put 3 gallons, even though I will eventually have 6.25 gallons in my kettle pre-boil once the mash and sparge are complete. </p>

<p>Then adjust my salts and minerals for the 3 gallons until I reach the desired water profile. 
I was told to then split the total salt/minerals additions into two parts. 
Put one part into the mash and the other addition into the boil kettle once all the wort is collected. </p>

<p>Can anyone explain why you would only calculate for 3 gallons and not 6.5 gallons? Is the spreadsheet accounting for this?
I feel like you would need to calculate for 6.25 gallons since that is what you would be boiling in the kettle.</p>

<p>I've read a lot of posts of other people saying they just put the total pre boil volume in there and not the mash sacchrifaction volume and it's starting to confuse me. </p>

<p>Listening to Brew Strong, Palmer states that you put only the initial 3 gallons for mash and then you have to calculate an additional salt/mineral addition for the other 4 gallons that would top off your kettle for say a 7 gallon pre boil volume.
So thinking it over, was what my friend trying to tell me when he said split it into two additions, he didn't literally mean split it in half, but to do two separate additions of the equal value, since your mash &amp; sparge volumes are almost equal?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Do you need any special tubing to attach the stone to the gas-in dip tube?</strong> The stone I have has a 1/4"" barb, but I wasn't sure if I
needed special hoses or gas hoses for this. Also wasn't sure if it would be a good
idea to have gas hoses sitting in my beer, i.e. if the plastic/vinyl
they're made from is safe for long term contact with beer. I figured
I would use plastic clamps here so I don't have to worry about a bad
steel clamp rusting or something. Would love to see pictures of this
if anyone has any.    </li>
<li><strong>Can you leave the stone on there for serving?</strong> I was planning to attach it to the empty keg, then siphon the into the keg beer and then seal it up and leave it on there to avoid contamination. I won't need to use it again for a while.</li>
<li><strong>Will yeast settling at the bottom of the cold keg clog the stone and/or prevent it from working?</strong> I was thinking of sticking the fermentor in the fridge overnight before siphoning to have some the yeast settle before transferring to the keg. Not sure if that's worthwhile though.</li>

"Deep cleaning equipment after ""brett"" contamination","<p><strong>A Few Contaminated Batches</strong></p>

<p>Although most of my beers have been coming out 'clean', I've had a couple of my beers show up with what I think might be bretanomyaces or some other 'bug'.  The contamination shows-up after they're bottled and have sit at room temperature for a while.  It has that slight ""cherry pie"" flavor that shouldn't be there.</p>

<p><strong>Oxi-Clean and Star-San</strong></p>

<p>My standard cleaning process includes overnight soak of the auto siphon and plastic carboy with Oxi-Clean Free.  I put about 1/2 cup of Oxi-Clean into the carboy with 5 gallons of hot (120F) city tap water and pump it through the auto siphon.  The next day all visible material adhering to the carboy walls is gone. I triple rinse with city tap water.  I then put a few cups of properly mixed Star-San solution into the carboy, pump it through the auto siphon, swirl to hit all interior surfaces, dump the Star-San and store the equipment. Before using the carboy or auto siphon again, I repeat the Star-San step.  I don't think the contamination is from my counterflow chiller, but I'll mention that I store it full of Star-San, then during the boil, I run boiling wort through it without the chilling water turned on.  So it sits at well over 150F for 10 minutes before I start the chilling process.</p>

<p><strong>Salvaging Equipment</strong></p>

<p>Apparently my sanitation practices are not good enough. I presume the problem is in the carboy and racking (I don't ever secondary, just bottle).  So the question is, what should I do to ""bring out the big guns"" from a cleaning perspective.  An easy step 1 is to throw out all my vinyl hoses.  Consider that <strong>done!</strong>.  But what to do about my auto siphon, which I'd hate to throw out.  And also my plastic carboys.  I don't see any scratching on them, and I've kept from using brushes on them, ever.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing Out the Big Guns for Cleaning/Sanitizing</strong></p>

<p>What more powerful cleaning solutions are available to me?  Bleach? Boiling water? I saw something in another post about quat or something like that?  I have not used PBW, and understand it's different than Oxi-Clean, but is that going to make the difference?  I don't want to get into a religious rant about sanitizers, but is Star-San letting me down? I've never used Iodaphor, and don't know much about it.  Should I use a powerful ""yes-rinse"" sanitizer first, and a no-rinse sanitizer after?  If you have suggestions, please recommend specific concentrations.</p>

"Wild fermentation with improvised equipment, any advice?","<p>First some background. I am in Indonesia for a bit, separated from my equipment and have had a chance to make the native fermented rice dish tape hitam (basically red rice wine without straining, eaten like a porridge.  Yes, this is beer you can eat with a fork, quite literally!).  Tape Hitam uses a mixture of cultures similar to Sake or Chinese Red Rice Wine.  I have also had Tape Putih, which is fermented cassava root using a similar process.  At least with Tape Hitam, typically the rice is just covered with a banana leaf.  No full seal or airlock is used, though the fermentation is only a few days at (tropical, no-air-conditioning) room temperature.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I had what I <em>thought</em> at the time was intentionally fermented soursop (you may know the fruit as guanabana).  It turned out it was not intentionally fermented, but was tasty anyway and rather intoxicating.  So I figured I would try to reproduce this, possibly using it as a basis for wines made from local fruit, etc.</p>

<p>So my current plan (which sounds really odd to me and my 20 years of brewing experience) is to follow the process that lead to the unintentional fermentation and do as follows:</p>

<p>let 1-2 soursops fully ripen and begin to go past their ideal ripening point, then scoop out the flesh (omitting any rotten spots) and put in an enclosed tupperware dish in the refridgerator for 2 weeks.  I might add some coconut sugar or honey but haven't decided yet.  After 2 weeks I will sample and if it is any good will mix in other fruit as I feel like, and grow the fermented fruit at that point kind of like a sourdough culture, preparing of course for some spoilage at some point.  If I can get an airlock (and maybe even if I can't), I hope to try to use this as a culture for making mead as well, probably in one of the water dispenser bottles.</p>

"how well to strain wort after boil","<p>Just wondering how well you folks strain your wort when transferring to primary.  </p>

<p>I brewed my first batch last night and, aside from forgetting to take an OG reading, everything went well.  However, I was surprised at the amount of trub in the wort.  As I was poring the wort into the fermenter using a cheap strainer, I couldn't help but wonder if I should be taking more care during this step.</p>

<p>I have a typical wire mesh strainer, like you might find at Target, which catches most of the trub but probably lets plenty through as well, that I used last night.  I've read somewhere (Palmer?) that you can line it with a couple layers of cheesecloth.  I also have a fine mesh strainer (like you might use to strain a consomme or something), but it would probably take upwards of 20-30 minutes to strain 3 gallons of wort through it.  I tend to think that the cheap strainer sans cheesecloth is probably fine, especially since I'll rack to a secondary before bottling anyway.  </p>

I will be happy you comment/correct me, and I have some questions at the end.</p>

<p>So I brew few amber ale from extract kit (very successfully) and want to try something new.<br>
I want to brew wheat beer with honey, and wish it will be as clear as possible (I know wheat beer should get the haze, but I am trying something here :)</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/335104/ava"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this recipe</a> with small amount of changes.
my steps should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat 21 Litre (5.5 Gallon) of water to 70 C (155F)</li>
<li>Take the flaked wheat and oats, put it in a steeping bag and steep the grains for 30 minutes</li>
<li>Take out the bag of grain and wash it with small amount of water at 80C (175F) - few times with ladle - not squeezing the bag.</li>
<li>Get to boiling point</li>
<li>Add the DME once the water is boiling and mix it.</li>
<li>Add hops for 60 mins (the only one in this recipe)</li>
<li>In the last 15 mins add the immersion chiller for sanitizing.</li>
<li>Add Honey and orange peel</li>
<li>Add whirlfloc tab</li>
<li>After 15 mins turn the flame out.</li>
<li>Start chilling</li>
<li>Rehydrate the yeast with 110 ML (4 oz) - 40C (105F) of the wort for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the wort is 24C (75F) whirlpool it and start siphoning it to the primary fermentation without trub as you can.</li>
<li>Stir the wort to add oxygen</li>
<li>Take OG value</li>
<li>Add the rehydrated yeasts</li>
<li>Close, add the airlock, and put it for few days in 22C (70F)</li>
<li>After the bubbles in the airlock are at much lower rate (±5 days), take gravity value once a day.</li>
<li>After 2 days with no change transfer it to secondary (slowly, not to oxygen).</li>
<li>Take FG value and calculate ABV</li>
<li>Give it another ±10 days.</li>
<li>Cold crash for 3 days at 2-3C (35-37F)</li>
<li>Boil 2 cups of water and add 220g (7.7oz) of corn sugar (calculator). Let it cool to 25C (77F)</li>
<li>Add it to the priming bucket, and slowly siphon the beer from the secondary (without trub as possible).</li>
<li>Bottle it.</li>
<li>Give it another 2 weeks at 22C (70F)</li>
<li>Cold it to 3C (37F) 24 hours before drinking.</li>
<li>Enjoy</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think about the process and steps?<br>
My questions for perfectly understand the process are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full boil or partial boil? I read a lot of pro and cons, but if I understand correctly, clearer and tastier beer will be a result of full boil wort.</li>
<li>Should I use Gelatin after transferring to secondary for clearer beer? or will the affect be very tiny and not worth it?</li>
<li>What will happens if I will use Lager dried yeasts instead of Ale, will it be clearer? of course I will use Lager fermentation rules (temperature, diacetyl rest, lagering). in general - can Ale or any other beer can be made with Lager yeasts?</li>
<li>Should I use DME or LME? If I am understood correctly, DME will give me lower SRM, right? any other differences?</li>
<li>Will late adding the extract (DME or LME) will help the beer to be clearer or lighter in color?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know it is not common to publish such a huge detailed question, but I wanted to gather it all in one place for the new brewers as well.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"When should you treat your water for pH for a sour beer?","<p>According to <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/3042/when-should-you-measure-and-adjust-mash-ph"">this question's answer</a>, from Denny Conn, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't pretreat the water because it's the mash pH you're concerned with, not the water pH.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this agrees with this <a href=""https://byo.com/hops/item/1493-the-power-of-ph"" rel=""noreferrer"">article on the power of pH</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Malted barley contains phosphates, which are acidic buffers. Making a mash of grain mixed with water will cause the phosphate buffers to achieve a natural pH of around 5.6. Therefore, <strong>it does not matter what the initial pH of your brewing water is</strong> because the interaction between ions in water and buffering components of the malt will always change the water pH.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in this <a href=""https://byo.com/stories/issue/item/3497-german-gose-style-profile"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gose recipe by Gordon Strong</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. <strong>Add 1⁄4 tsp. 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5</strong> at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://sourbeerblog.com/fast-souring-lactobacillus/"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast souring article</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>After your saccharification rest is complete</strong>, reduce the pH of the wort to 4.5 by addition of food grade lactic or phosphoric acid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what I'm gathering from all this is that you treat your mash to be between 5.2 and 5.5 for the purpose of ensuring the mash converts efficiently, and you treat your wort, post mash, to make it more friendly to your lacto inoculation (although, this is not specifically in Gordon's recipe). </p>

<ol>
<li>Does this sound correct, and if so, is Gordon's recommendation to treat the water incorrect, or does it have to do with the RO water? </li>
<li>For a sour, would you treat the wort pH post mash or post sparge? Or does it matter at that point?</li>
</ol>

<p>If it matters, I am batch sparging. </p>

"Can you increase the pH for the boil after kettle souring?","<p><a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/21804/when-should-you-treat-your-water-for-ph-for-a-sour-beer"">This question</a>'s answer led me to <a href=""http://www.milkthefunk.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.milkthefunk.com</a> which is a great source of information. </p>

<p>Since there's a few methods for making sour beer, I should mention I've been doing what some call a kettle sour (or fast sour) where I do a mash, then a full boil, then sour the beer using l plantarum in a sealed keg purged with CO2, then do another full boil (topping up with water) then ferment as a standard ale, then keg for carbonation. </p>

<p>One of the issues I've had with sour beer is DMS, really with any pilsner as well. (This is why I am now doing a full boil before kettle souring.) It turns out, there are some reasons for it, as according to <a href=""http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Dimethyl_Sulfide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the article on DMS</a> </p>

<p>For one, I'm boiling at 6500 ft elevation, so my boiling temp is ~199F/93C (instead of 212F/100C)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has long been reported that the half-life of SMM doubles for every 6°C cooler, meaning that at 95°C the half-life is ~70 minutes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And two, especially important for sour beers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pH plays a role in the reduction of SMM to DMS, with a higher pH reducing the half-life of SMM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning I really need to be boiling for >2 hours to be rid of DMS for an ale! For a sour, the pH may be in the 3.4 range, where SMM half-life is now 142 at 200F/94C. </p>

<p>Empirically, I've been having good success with a 75 minute boil for a standard ale. My ales do not have significant DMS with that boil time.</p>

<p>Does this mean I need a 284 minute (nearly 5 hour) boil for a sour beer at elevation to remove DMS!?!?!? (I am doubling the half-life after adjusting for both temperature (elevation) and acidity (pH).) If I do a full boil before souring, and a full boil after souring, do these add together? Or, not really, since each boil went above 80C, each boil needs to be figured independently?</p>

<p>Lastly, the question this has been leading up to, after the kettle sour portion is finished, can I raise pH to 5.2 using Calcium Carbonate to increase the DMS boil-off without altering the taste? Or will that kill the ""sourness"" by reducing the acidity? </p>

"is my cider infected or is this normal for safaleUS05","<p>Made a batch of cider with granny smith apples 13%brix. Juiced my self.
used half or maybe less of Kmeta than what is suggested on the packet</p>

<p>July 3: saf-ale US05 yeast. Starter was 2L apple juice with 1 packet left to ferment for 24 - 48 hours.
took a couple of days to start fermenting.
Apple juice was very appley and nice.</p>

<p>July 8: I wanted to try adding  pectic enzyme at the start of fermenting.</p>

<p>July 10: Started tasting and smelling like vomit and it lost the strong apple smells and tastes. Had milky haze that would stick to the side of drinking glass.</p>

<p>22 July: vomit smell/taste was gone and juice sweet but insipid 7%brix</p>

<p>I want to re-use the yeast but am concerned the yeast might be infected with something. Perhaps cider sickness? seems strange to get infected while fermenting though. Is this to be expected from safale US05(first time using it) when used with cider,or could it be the pectic enzyme addition, while fermenting giving off the vomit smell?</p>

want to use the yeast for beer.</p>

<p>I was thinking that perhaps I should split the must into two buckets and add water to each and then re-pitch?  Would that even work?

"Krausen During Primary","<p>I'm wondering what other peoples' experiences are with krausen at the start of fermentation.  I've had some beers that have bubbled along happily without producing huge amounts of foam, and others that seem like they'll neve stop spuming.  This weekend we started a stout and I installed a small plastic airlock.  By 7 AM the next morning there was krausen up through the airlock, down the sides of the carboy, and trickling away in a tiny stream.  I cleaned everything up and switched to a larger diameter hose with its end in a bucket of water so the foam had somewhere to go, but there seems to be substantial quantities of wort being lost by this (I'd estimate 1/3 gallon in this case).

"How much Malto Dextrine or Cara Pils is needed to mimic higher mash temps?","<p>So from what I've read, a lot of professional brewers mash <strong>all</strong> their beers at the same temps (usually around 150F), and use ingredients to adjust the ""body"" or ""sweetness"" of the final beers. At their scale, its preferable to keep the mashing process identical for all their batches. I guess they find it easier to fiddle with the grain bill slightly than to adjust mash temps for each recipe.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am considering moving to this approach for my homebrew. My question is this, <strong>if I mash all my beers at 150F, how can I mimic mashing at, say, 152F or 154F or 156F with ingredients?</strong> Does anyone have any experience in this area? I could just start with adding 8oz of Cara Pils and seeing where that gets me, but I'd rather hear from someone who's done this alteration before, with the intent of figuring out how to translate a lower mash directly into increased CaraPils or Malto Dextrine.</p>

After I bottle and cap the beer do I store the beer in the fridge? Dark but No Fridge? I think I have done a decent job so far, and would hate to FUBAR everything up at this point!</p>

<p>If it helps the kit I purchased is for a Weizenbier....and when I said we did pretty good I mean that we only messed up and added both cans of LME to the boil at the same time instead of early in the boil and one during the last 15 mins. The maker of the kit said this it would just make a darker wheat bear but should be fine. </p>

"Using trub directly vs. yeast rinsing.","<p>Sometimes referred to as ""yeast washing,"" the process of yeast rinsing separates the yeast from the hops and break material in the trub.  Most brewers who reuse yeast &mdash; and store it for long periods &mdash; seem to prefer the rinsing method.  Some brewers simply store the trub in one or several sanitized jars.  After storing this trub in the fridge, they will then either reuse this yeast directly or create a starter with it.</p>

<p>Has anyone tried both methods?  If you reuse the trub directly, how long have you stored this yeast, and have you ever noticed off flavors?  What are the pros and cons of both methods?</p>

"First brew... 1.010 gravity in 72 hours?","<p>I'm in the middle of my first brew and I'm having some issues. Not sure if I have completely ruined this thing or what. Heres the deal...</p>

<p>During the process, everything went pretty much as planned with a few exceptions. For one, the guy at that local store didn't sell me enough DME for the kit I bought (Munton's Nut Brown Ale) so I ended up using half DME and half table sugar. I researched it beforehand it saw table sugar isn't really recommended, but can do in a pinch. Since I already opened the tin with the syrup, I figured this qualified as a pinch. </p>

<p>Second issue... my airlock O-ring wasn't set properly. Yesterday I got concerned at the lack of bubbles in the airlock and I popped the lid and saw the O-ring wasn't set. After setting the o-ring properly and reinserting the airlock, I did indeed see a pretty frequent bubble in the airlock, say every 15 seconds or so. </p>

<p>Now its only day three and no bubbles at all on the airlock again. After waiting a while I decided to do a hydrometer reading. It came out as 1.010. The kit says primary fermentation should take ""4-7 days or until SG is below 1.008."" So... Whats the deal? Did I containment when I popped the lid yesterday to adjust the airlock? I did read one forum that said table sugar often ferments faster, could it just have really gone that quickly? I did not see a lot of foam, but yesterday there was a fairly small foamy head on the brew. I certainly wouldn't say I saw a ""vigorous fermentation"" like I've seen others talk about. </p>

<p>For what its worth, the beer LOOKS fine. </p>

<p>I have no problem letting it sitting for as long as it needs, but if hope is lost I'd rather start over now that I know a little better what I'm doing. I definitely admit I rushed into my first brew due to a hectic schedule with work and family. </p>

"Pumpkin Ale: what to expect?","<p>Recently I bought some concentrated wort at a closeout sale. 'Brew House' kits have been fairly popular here in BC and possibly elsewhere, and they can produce a drinkable beer, but it seems they're shutting down the plant. Given the choice of a wheat beer and a 'Pumpkin Ale'—the only two styles they had left—I picked up 4 Pumpkin Ales, each good for 5 gallons, at 1/2 price.</p>

<p>I'm about to begin all-grain brewing soon. I'm excited about all of the options, combinations, and ratios of the different grains, but it is very daunting. I have 8 carboys so I might as well use them to learn the distinctive taste of various grains and combinations of grains.</p>

<p>In order for this tasting experiment to be valid, I would need to use the same yeast and hops across every batch. I figure that it would be best to use a shy or weaker yeast and hops, meaning those that would allow the grain to come through more fully, and to use a yeast/hops that interact well with all combinations of grain.</p>

<p>Which yeast and which hops would fit this criteria?</p>

<p>On the other hand, am I missing key pieces of information here? For example, perhaps there does not exist a single combination of yeast/hops that work with all combinations of grain. This could mislead me into thinking that I do not like the taste of a certain grain, when it was really just the yeast or hops that I chose and their interaction with the grains.</p>

"Do I need to continuously measure the temperature of my mash tun?","<p>From what I understand, the all-grain brewer warms up water to a particular temperature (usually 10-15*F over the strike temperature), adds this warm water to the grains in a mash tun, in an attempt to hit a particular temperature (around 145-160*F depending on the grains/style of beer), and then dumps the wort after an hour. I also understand that it is important to keep the temperature of the mash tun consistent at the desired temperature for this entire time; this is why a cooler is recommended for beginners.</p>

<p>However in a few YouTube videos, I've seen the all-grain brewer feed in a temperature probe into the mash tun and leave the cooler lid slightly ajar to allow for this. To an extract brewer like myself, this looks pretty silly, as the temperature would remain more consistent with the lid fully closed.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a risk that (even in a cooler mash tun) the temperature might drop significantly enough to warrant additional hot water, such that measuring the temperature is more important than closing the lid completely? Or is there something else I am not considering?</strong></p>

<p>At the same time I would LOVE to use my RaspberryPi to record this temperature. I'm thinking about drilling a hole for an airlock and feeding a temperature probe into the airlock (as I do with my carboys) to enable me to record the temperature of the mash tun while having an airtight environment.</p>

"Inconsistencies in fermentables' ppg calculation","<p>I've been searching around the net, asking in forums, even writing to Weyermann, trying to figure out what is the correct formula -- using a malt spec sheet -- to calculate the ppg value that I can use in recipes.</p>

<p>According to this article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brewersfriend.com/2012/11/30/making-sense-of-efficiency-definitions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brewersfriend.com/2012/11/30/making-sense-of-efficiency-definitions/</a></p>

<p>.. I should basically account with moisture content (MC%) and extract fine grind value (DBFG%). However, this gives lower ppg values than is widely referenced for given grains. It feels as if all the other sources do not account for MC%..</p>

<p>For example, I have a spec sheet of Weyermann Pale Ale, where:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moisture content = 4% max</li>
<li>Extract dry substance = 79% min</li>
</ul>

<p>Using formula:</p>

<p>ppg = 0.46214 * DBFG * (1-MC) * 100</p>

<p>.. I calculate:</p>

<p>0.46214 * 77% * (1 - 4.5%) * 100 = 35.049</p>

<p>However, for the reference, there is an add-on feature in BeerSmith that allows to add custom malts and their Weyermann Pale Malt gives ppg as 38.</p>

<p>1) Does anybody know what is the really correct way to calculate the ppg?</p>

<p>2) I've seen all the malt specs give MC% as ""max"" and DBFG% as ""min"", but how can I know what is the range (maybe DBFG is in range of 79%..82%, which would make a big difference)?</p>

But now after fermenting the third beer for 6 weeks, the FG has been stagnant for the latter 2 weeks at 1.027. I just bottled it and am certainly looking forward to trying it, but the FG was way off (13 points, where the first was 9 and the second was only 4). Every time, I aerated my wort and used a yeast starter. Thus I really doubt yeast health is an issue but of course I could be wrong. The Belgian IPA stopped at week 3 at about 1.030, so I added about 6 oz of corn sugar to try and get it going again. The yeast attacked it once I dropped it in, but the FG didn't come down much further. The temperature for each of these was around 65 degrees +- 3. I brought my Belgian IPA into a warmer room so it could stay at a steady 68 after the third week (also when I added more sugar) and it still didn't come down. I have been doing the mash in my 15 gallon brew kettle. I suspect my wort isn't as fermentable as maybe it should be. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>My question(s) is this: Before moving forward with another brew, are there any recommendations anybody has to ensure I can get closer to my FG? Would a high ph affect FG in this way? Should I be using a cooler for the mash instead of my stainless kettle? Should I increase the mash time? I have heard the that optimal ph for mash is 5.2 and that the mash process will reach this ph eventually. Should I start the 60 minutes AFTER I reach a ph of 5.2?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><strong>There was never a problem with attenuation or FG being off. If anything, my FG readings were below the target. I didn't realize there was a wort correction factor when using refractometers for FG readings.</strong></p>

"Aside from CO2 and N2, are any other gases used to ""carbonate"" beer?","<p>Obviously, most beers are carbonated with carbon dioxide, while some stouts/porters are ""carbonated"" with nitrogen.</p>

<p>I was curious if there has been any notable experimentation with other gasses to ""carbonate"" beer. If nitrogen can introduce a ""creamy"" texture to a beer, I would think that other gasses would also be able to introduce their own characteristics on beer. If any of these experiments have done, what characteristics do these other gases impart?</p>

<p>I'm sure cost would be an issue for certain gasses that would prohibit its use in beer, but for purposes of this question, cost is irrelevant.</p>

<p>As an aside, what is the correct term to use, as opposed to ""carbonate"", for a question of this nature?</p>

"Possible failed ferment: re-boil or campden + re-pitch?","<p>On Saturday I brewed my 89th batch, an all-grain Irish Red Ale, SG 1.049.  Pitched Wyeast 1084 from an ""Activator"" smack pack dated May 2012 that I'd struck around eight hours earlier, then aerated the wort using a paddle-mixer drill attachment for two minutes.  None of these are new procedures to me, although I typically smack the pack the night before brewing instead of that morning (or make a starter on a stir-plate).  It's been around 40 hours and there's no sign of fermentation and no drop in gravity.</p>

<p>I will give it another day and a half before I call the fermentation failed and in the meantime will order new yeast from a more reputable source.  I probably won't receive the new yeast until Thursday or Friday, so I'm curious about what the best approach is for potentially sterilizing the wort before re-pitching should it come to that.  I can think of three options:</p>

<p>1) Don't do anything.  Assume the wort is still essentially sterile after one week in the fermenter, pitch the new yeast and aerate again.</p>

<p>2) Pasteurize the wort by bringing it up to around 180 degrees F, chill, pitch, aerate.</p>

<p>3) Add Campden tablets at some appropriate rate, let the wort sit for 24 (?) hours for the sulfites to evaporate, pitch and aerate.</p>

"How do I set up a Sestos D1S temperature controller?","<p>I am trying to set up an Sestos D1S temperature controller. Initially, just to see if it works at all, I am trying to use it to control the temperature of my kettle. I've wired it all up correctly so that it can switch the kettle on and off, and the temperature probe is in the kettle. The temperature reading on the front is correct, but the device seems to be impossible to set up.</p>

<p>I have tried autotuning, manual tuning, and simple manual mode. None of thes has worked properly. The only thing which does work is On/Off mode, although it seems to only switch off about 2 seconds after the temperature has gone past the set point.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SzgAY.jpg"" alt=""Sestos D1S""></p>

<p><strong>How do I set up the time period?</strong><br>
Since the kettle heats up very quickly, the time period should be very short, and preferably the duty cycle kept low. Se I set the <strong>Ctl</strong> (Control Period) to 1, for 1 second. I assumed that I would see the output switching on and off at 1Hz, but I do not. I also set the <strong>oPH</strong> to 50, meaning that it should have a maximum 50% duty cycle. However, the output stays on for many seconds.</p>

<p><strong>How do I set the PID valued?</strong>
According to the manual:</p>

<p><strong>M50</strong> = Integral<br>
<strong>P</strong> = Differential<br>
<strong>t</strong> = Hysteresis Time<br></p>

<p>Can this really be correct? Where is the Proportional setting?</p>

<p><strong>How do I get it to auto tune?</strong>
I followed the manual and managed to make it flash 'At', which I think means it's Autotuning. However, the temperature fluctuated wildly, and finally settled, oscillating between 53ºC and 60ºC, even though the set point was 50ºC.</p>

<hr>

<p>Added: I am using the following settings</p>

<pre><code>dF   0.3    (Hysteresis)
Ctrl   3    (PID mode)
M50    0    (Integral)
P   1000    (Proportional?)
t      0    (Derivative?)
Ctl    1    (Control Period: 1 second)
oP1    0    (Output method: Time Duty)
oPL    0    (Output minimum: 0%)
oPH   50    (Output minimum: 50%)
run    1    (Automatic)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Added:</p>

<p>With Ctl at 3 (3 second period) and the output duty at 50% (display reads A 50) I an see that the output comes on for 35 seconds, then goes off for 35 seconds. This is a period of 70 seconds.</p>

<p>With Ctl at 0 (0.5 second period according to the instuctions) the period is still 70 seconds. </p>

<p>So it looks like the control period is stuck at 70 seconds. Flicking through the settings, none of the numbers are set to 70 (or 35 or 140). So I don't think there's another setting which is controlling the period.</p>

<hr>

<p>Added:</p>

<pre><code>Ctl  Period
40  = 40s
20  = 20s
10  = 10s
 8  =  8s
 6  =  8s
 4  =  8s
 3  =  8s
 2  = 70s
 1  = 70s
 0  = 70s
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Added:</p>

<p>I set P=2, I=0, D=0, Max output = 50%, and set the setpoint to 70ºC. I watched the output duty as the temperature rose slowly to 69ºC. At that point, the output duty slowly began to fall, until at 70ºC it was still at 42%. It finally settled at 79.4ºC with an output duty of 4%.  This really sounds like a fault in the control.</p>

"How to proceed when step-feeding a mead","<p>I am in the process of planning my next mead batch, and I wondered if it would be a good idea to step-feed this one since I am planning a high ABV (18%). How would I do this best? </p>

<p>My recipe looks like this for now: </p>

<ul>
<li>3 US gal total target volume</li>
<li>5.3 kg honney (amounts to about 3.7 litres)</li>
<li>Kitzinger Portwine yeast (max ABV of 18%)</li>
<li>Some yeast nutrients and salts</li>

"How does efficiency change when adding grains that are normally steeped to a mash?","<p>Imagine this scenario: you have a an extract recipe that contains a pound of steeped caramel malt. According to <a href=""http://www.promash.com/FAQ/faq_diff.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.promash.com/FAQ/faq_diff.html</a> the average efficiency of steeped malts is around 30% (as steeping is mostly for color/flavor), so you can calculate the GU potential and take 30% of that for the original gravity estimate. Essentially GU = PPG * weight / gallons * efficiency.</p>

<p>Now imagine I change the recipe, and use pale malt as a base instead of the extract turning it into an all-grain recipe. I assume at this point I would throw the caramel malt in with the mash, which has an average efficiency of something like 75%. Does that mean I take 75% of the pale malt GU and 30% of the caramel, or 75% of both?</p>

<p>I'm going to actually take a gravity reading tonight (I was so excited to taste it last night that I forgot to pull enough to measure) and do the forced diacetyl test.  </p>

<p>My question is, what is the purpose of lowering the temp to lagering temp SO.  DARNED.  SLOWLY?  I've read that is should be 1 degree per day, which means this won't get to lagering temperature for 22 days, then another 4-5 weeks lagering!  </p>

"Question about the diacetyl rest process","<p>When producing beers that must have a ""clean"" / ""neutral"" flavor like lagers, usually the fermenting temperature is low to prevent off-flavors to show. But then, is recomended to apply a diacetyl rest in order to reduce the buttery, butterscotch-like flavor to beer that the diacetyl provide. Here's the part I don't understand. You do a lager fermentation at lower temperatures to prevent off-flavors, but to do a diacetyl rest you <strong><em>raise</em></strong> the temperature from  about 50° to 55° F to 65° to 68° F. What's the explanation for that? Isn't raising the temperature causes the yeast to produce undesired flavors to the beer? I don't get it!</p>

"Is delayed yeast activity normal?","<p>I am working on a small batch, 1 gallon of Pale Ale. It came in a kit and the yeast was not labeled so I am not sure what kind it is. This is only the third batch I have brewed. On my first two batches I saw a lot of activity by the second day and things died down by day seven, I racked to secondary (these were 5 gallon batches) on the 7th or 8th day. </p>

<p><strong>What I am unsure how to handle is, on the 7th day there is more activity than there has been all week.</strong> Seems obvious that I should not interrupt the process, but being new I wanted to ask. </p>

"Chill the wort faster by applying convection (by putting it inside a laundry machine)?","<p>There are some new gadgets that allow to chill the beer as fast as 2 min. It's not rocket science, just a more efficient way to increase heat transfer by rotating the desired object (link below provides more details). So i was thinking about using this same principle by putting ice inside a laundry machine and then putting the wort inside a closed container. This would chill the wort very fast and there's the bonus of a massive aeration. Have anyone tried something similar? The more experienced brewers could point out some possible flaws in this approach? Thanks!</p>

"How coarse should I grind the malt?","<p>I and my soon to be wife have just started brewing on our own and at the moment we are using a local provider for our malt. The malt comes ground in a plastic bag and is relatively fresh but a bit unevenly ground. In the bottom of the bag there is quite a lot of malt that is almost in flour form. I have been unsure whether or not to add this flour to the brew as it tends to go through our filter and some times get stuck in our equipment. </p>

<p>I'm afraid it might burn at the bottom of our cooking pot if we include to much of it but I don't want to lose to much of the sugar. It has not burned yet as I have usually separated it out and put it at the top of the brew after adding water to make sure it does not fall out of the filter. This process is how ever quite tedious and I am considering whether it is necessary or not.</p>

"My first yeast starter with a stir plate, possibly a disaster","<p>This morning I smacked my first smack pack, and about 10 times, each time a little harder because deep depression would set in if the goodies spewed across the room. I finally got it, or so I thought. Fizzing away on the inside, it started to swell a bit about after an hour or so, and then 6 hours later, I sanitized my stuff, dumped it into my flask, all that good stuff... and it's doing its thing on the stir plate. It didn't swell up a lot at all, but also read about many people not bothering to even wait when they're using a stir plate. </p>

<p>So it's a 1L starter, that of which I'm going to chill in the fridge tomorrow, throw out the spent wort, and add some more to step it up.</p>

<p>Here's why I'm worried:</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tore open the packet to see the little stubborn pack inside that wouldn't bust very easy, and to my surprise, it's actually a double pack?! One half broke, whereas the other did not! It's a rectangular shaped pack, with two sides, each separate from each other. Is this some type of mixture? Or just double the amount for a higher gravity (which is what I'm trying to make)</p>

<p>So what I'm planning to do, unless someone can instruct me otherwise, is to throw in the contents of the second part of that pack tomorrow, when I step up the starter. </p>

<p>Please advise, and thank you... Loving this. Hope the non-swelling, and extra packet thing isn't going to ruin my starter.</p>

"What does a gravity reading really mean?","<h1>The simple/short version of the question:</h1>

<p>What does a hydrometer gravity reading of 1.036 really mean?  Does it mean the density of the liquid is 3.6% greater than that of distilled water (ignoring inaccuracies and errors in measurement)?</p>

<h1>The context/long version of the question:</h1>

<p>When creating a yeast starter, it is commonly advised to create a light wort in the range of 1.030 to 1.040 gravity by using 100g of dry malt extract (DME) per liter of water in the starter, or a 10-to-1 ratio of water to DME by weight.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(alcoholic_beverage)#Specific_gravity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>, gravity is ""the ratio of the density of a sample to the density of water"", or equivalently, the ratio of the mass of a given volume of a sample to the mass of an equal volume of pure water.  By my math, 1L of water is ~1000g (with variation depending on temperature), and dissolving 100g of DME into that should result in a gravity of (1000g + 100g)/1000g = 1.100.  This is very, very far off from the 1.030-1.040 range expected by common wisdom.</p>

<p>Thinking this common wisdom was perhaps just a commonly-repeated mistake, I checked the suggestions of 4 online yeast starter calculators, to see how much DME they each suggest should be added to 1 liter of water to achieve 1.036 gravity (apologies for the non-links, apparently I need more reputation to post more than 2):</p>

<ul>
<li>102.7g according to www.brewersfriend.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator/</li>
<li>103g according to www.captainbrew.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator</li>
<li>98.18g according to www.yeastcalculator.com/yeastcalc.html</li>
<li>98g according to www.brewunited.com/yeast_calculator.php</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from rounding differences, there are 2 different values given here, within ~5% of each other, and essentially agreeing with commonly-repeated advice.  In contrast, my straightforward calculation would suggest the value is 36g of DME per liter, barely more than a third of the values from the calculators.</p>

<p>So I checked experimentally (and very roughly) while creating a big starter.  Using a kitchen scale, I took 3.1L of hot tap water (the extra 0.1L is to compensate a bit for boil-off), and added 300g of DME.  I brought it to a rolling boil and held it there for ~5 minutes to sanitize, then used a larger pot to make an ice water bath, and cooled the starter wort to ~68F according to my floating thermometer.  I checked the gravity with my hydrometer, and it read ~1.040.  There's plenty of room for little errors here, but the fact is, I got results pretty much in line with the common advice and the online calculators.</p>

<p>I just don't understand how this can be.  It seems like I should have seen a gravity reading close to 1.100.  But when common wisdom, 4 online calculators using (apparently) at least 2 different equations, and my own experimental results all disagree with my abstract logic, I have to assume my abstract logic is incorrect.

"Mead: is it time to bottling?","<p>I have a few questions. I'm making mead for the first time. My mead is now brewing for 2 months (since 11th august), but I'm not sure if it's time to bottle it. That's because it is still sparking. I know that it is the consequence of the brewing, but since the sparkle is not that strong as it was at the beginning, in fact it is very weak. </p>

<p>1- Can I bottle it or I have to wait until the mead is completely still? </p>

<p>2- Also, when I shake it, bubbles of CO2 are still coming up from the airlock. What should I do?  </p>

<p>3- And what kind of caps should I use (sugar cap, plastic, metal crown stoppers, ...)? </p>

<p>You can also see from the pic the mead is still turbid, I guess.

"Advice for a Harry Potter butterbeer","<p>I'm in the inception phase of a Harry Potter inspired butterbeer recipe. Since it's not well explained in the books, I'm going for a a flavor profile in the range of spiced eggnog and root beer.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a big, creamy head and (if possible) a color like hefeweizen. Spices will be nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and sassafras (also considering vanilla bean?). For malt I'm going for 40L caramel malt for steeping, and 50/50 Maillard Gold and Wheat extracts and some lactose. </p>

<p>Does anyone have have advice on amounts of the spices and lactose to use for a 1 gallon recipe and how to add a butterscotch flavor?

"Starsan in double bubble airlock keeps getting sucked into fermenter - why and how to prevent?","<p>I did a brew on Saturday and cooled, got in the fermenting bucket and added yeast, added starsan to the chamber in the double bubble airlock and got it under the stairs. Ever since then, the starsan gets sucked into the fermenter, fairly quickly as well (after I replace it). I've heard this is due to temperature change creating a vacuum. I've also heard that that shouldn't happen with this type of airlock. Its not happened before to this extent (i.e. I've never had to replace the starsan).</p>

<p>Any ideas why this is happening? And is there a way I can prevent it? I'm not too concerned right now as the yeast is still working and producing carbon dioxide but when it finishes I still plan to leave it (three weeks in total) so I don't want the possibility of oxygen getting in.</p>

I didn't forget it, per se, but I forgot that I was supposed to smack the smack pack three hours in advance (per the instructions on the Wyeast Activator package, it says three hours in advance or pitch immediately). Being a beer wunderkind, I split the difference and smacked it 90 minutes before pitch time. It had expanded some before I pitched it, but it wasn't quite full. Should I be concerned? More importantly, if I don't see fermentation activity in the next 24-36 hours, can I just put in more yeast (properly prepared this time)?</p>

"Whirlpool hop additions","<p>What is the real difference between a whirlpool hop addition and a flameout hop addition?</p>

<p>The practice of whirlpooling is more of a pro-equipment setup type of technique, but I have seen and heard pro-brewers mentioning both additions in the same breath.</p>

<p>The difference must be within the way they use their equipment.</p>

<p>The main point for confusion to me is that a whirlpool hop addition happens during the whirlpool but before the chill.  Isn't that the same as a flameout addition????</p>

<p>Unless, the whirlpool is happening post chill; then you could see it more as a dryhop (pre-ferment) addition.  But when you think about how the equipment works, a whirlpool tank post chill doesn't seem realistic because post chill you want that wort in the fermentor and with the yeast ASAP.</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>I was watching a video on youtube regarding corny kegs the other day. In the video a statement was made regarding the static relief valves on pin lock corny kegs. Specifically, the statement made was that once a static relief valve has been activated (i.e at 130 psi) it must be replaced. The video did not state what happens if you do not replace it. Perhaps the keg simply does not hold pressure, or worse it no longer automatically vents pressure. Unfortunately I do not remember the link. </p>

<p>1 week later the fermenting has stopped, tested and carefully transferred to secondary.  </p>

<p>After only 24 hrs i pulled some into a glass and it was carbonated with as expected a bitter yeasty taste as it still needs to mature. </p>

<p>1) why after such a short time is the beer carbonated with no fermenting when it was flat before transfer to secondary? There are no visual signs of fermenting going on. Might my keg explode? it's good for 15 psi. </p>

<p>2) should i leave it 2 weeks (as suggested by some members and mico brewers) in the keg and then add my 5 ounces of primer and bottle or should i prime and bottle now?</p>

<p>I know to convert all-grain recipes to extract, you multiply the grain amount by .75 for LME and .6 for DME. Doing that for this recipe only gives about 3.9 kg for LME (in place of the 2-row).</p>

  the carapils and Crystal 40. Try running it through Promash and tweak
  the DME until you hit 1.074. I'm kind of a noob, so I'd wait for

<p>So, bubbles stopped a long ago, there's no activity on any fermenter, beside 1 of them. </p>

<p>What could be happening to it to restart to bubble? It can be a sign of too much time in primary? Never take so much time in primary, always bottled after 1 or 2 weeks, but reading here make me feel encouraged to spend more time. I live in Brasil, my room temp is sigthly higher than the optimal.</p>

<p>Thanks in advice.</p>

"How to adjust my wine?","<p>I'm looking for some general advice/recommended reading, etc.   </p>

<p>I've made a few wine kits and they've all come out OK.  I feel I have the general process down and I'm ready to start with perhaps fresh grape juice.</p>

<p>I've always thought that one advantage I have over commercial wineries is that I can add anything I want to my wine.  If it's not sweet enough, I can add sugar.  Not enough acid, I can add more, etc.</p>

<p>But my problem is, I don't know how to tell from raw juice what might be needed.  I know I can measure the sugar, etc., but since juice tastes so much different, I don't see how to tell what it will be like in six months.   I don't even know if I can recall how a batch of juice tasted six months ago to say, ""yep that needed more oak, or more malic acid.""</p>

<p>How do commercial winemakers do it, other than making dozens of batches?  Or is there no shortcut?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your advice.</p>

<p>Most of the time in homebrewing materials, it is said that in volume calculations one should account for 4% expansion of water from 20C to 100C (on standard pressure). More precise expansion can be calculated based on volumetric expansion coefficients.</p>

"Effect of adding bacteria when racking to secondary","<p>I recently brewed a Flanders red ale and it is nearing the end of primary fermentation. I'm planning to rack it to a carboy and leave it for up to about a year.</p>

<p>While doing research on the style, I saw various recipes that added everything (yeast and bacteria) to primary and others that used just the yeast for primary and added the bacteria (and Brettanomyces) when racking to secondary. I decided to do the latter for various reasons but I want to clarify that my thinking was on the right track.</p>

<p>My thinking was that if I had added the bacteria to primary, there would have been a lot of additional compounds created as they consumed sugars, competing with the yeast. Many of these may be cleaned up during the long fermentation but I imagine the beer would still end up with some signs of that process, and I'm not sure I wanted that.</p>

<p>By adding it to secondary, I'm assuming that the beer will come out a bit cleaner but still develop a good amount of sourness (probably a little less but hopefully not much less).</p>

"Did I add too much chalk?","<p>I'm doing an AG porter recipe. Historically, I have been dissatisfied with my porters - they come out thin, and a bit acidic. Some research suggested that my issue may be mash pH, so I bought so pH strips and some chalk. I measured my mash pH using the strips and it was in the 4.9 range, so I started adding chalk 1 teaspoon at a time. Eventually I got to 5 teaspoons, and the pH strip still registered about 5.0, MAYBE 5.1, but it is hard to tell with the colors. I decided to err on the side of caution and stop adding stuff to my mash.</p>

"Splitting a kit five ways: yeast (or other) advice?","<p>I'm planning to split a kit five ways to do a test on different water types.  The kit is a two-can 3.6Kg LME kit (St Peter's IPA made by Muntons) that's designed to make about 20 litres of beer.  I figure I'll get five PET one-gallon FVs to brew in, weigh the LME and split into five, add the appropriate water, and split the hop extract five ways (should be doable by eye).</p>

<p>The main question I have is about the yeast.  These Muntons kits come with a 6g yeast sachet, which is pretty small to start with.  Splitting it 5 ways is going to be 1.2g yeast per fermenter, which sounds very small.</p>

<p>Options I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just split it and not worry.  Probably rehydrate first (in distilled water) then split the liquid/sludge as well as I can.</li>
<li>Use a starter to bump up the volume a bit, then split that.</li>
<li>Try to find out from Muntons what kind of yeast they use (it's been labelled ""X HND 6 G YEAST PREMIUM MADE IN EU"" on other kits I've had from them) and getting four new packets and using one in each.  I'm a little worried that inconsistencies between the packets might mess up my test, but perhaps I could rehydrate them all in one batch and then split that five ways?</li>

<ul>
<li>5 gallon batch (I messed up the OG reading, the instructions said it should be ~1.044)</li>
<li>bottled after 12 days in the primary</li>
<li>gravity had stabilized at 1.015 for several days (the instructions expected FG: 1.010-1.012)</li>
<li>added 5oz of dissolved corn sugar (a Brewer's Best priming packet ) to the bottling bucket</li>
<li>racked the beer onto the priming sugar (to mix it) </li>
<li>filled the bottles: about half in 12oz bottles, half in 22oz bottles, and one flip top growler</li>

<p>I took <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/4436/expect-the-unexpected-how-can-i-prepare-for-bottle-bombs/4438#4438"">@Jeff's suggestion</a> and opened and recapped every bottle. Turns out that I had three time bombs waiting to go off that foamed all over the place. I had missed those four bottles with the bottle brush and sent them straight to the sanitizer solution, apparently without looking too closely. Those three gushers had nasty crud caked on the bottom, things floating in the beer, and they smelled bad. Based on what I've read, sounds like an infection. The rest looked fine when I held them up to the sun with a thin white film on the bottom. The bottles were from several cases of 22oz bottles I had inherited from a friend that were really cruddy since they'd been sitting with sediment in a garage for several years. I was checking them pretty closely before moving them to the sanitizer to make sure they were clean, but it looks like four of them skipped a step in that process. </p>

"Scaling a recipe for bad efficiency","<p>A little over a year ago I did my first all-grain.  I adapted it from some recommendations for a good Christmas ale.  I listed the grains below.  It was a huge success except for one problem.  We ran out Christmas morning.  I hit a fairly high gravity, 1.072.  However I had a very low yield.  With successive batches I learned that my problem was in the brew kettle.  I have a very large heel.  I need to boil roughly 7.25 to 7.5 gallons of wort to get 5 gallons.  Roughly a gallon of that is evaporated, the rest is heel.</p>

<p>The brew kettle is on my short list to be replaced. Until then I've been making due with what I have.  from recent batches I know that with 15# of grain and my typical efficiency, I get an OG somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.052 to 1.056 for five gallons.  I'm going to be brewing another batch this weekend and I would really like to hit an OG in the neighborhood of 1.072.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I expect this ratio to be a linear scale?</li>
<li>How much grain should I add to scale this?</li>
<li>Should I add a proportional amount of all the grains or just the base grains? </li>

<li>13#    2-row</li>
<li>1#     white wheat</li>
<li>1#     crystal 40L</li>
<li>0.25#   special roast malt</li>
<li>0.25#   roasted barley</li>

"Should I keep my batch?","<p>I tried to create a sour beer from a sour mash from the second runnings of a Double IPA. I kept the mash tun in the garage, but unfortunately it rained and got colder than I thought it would. (I live in Los Angeles, so I wasn't too concerned about the season at the time.) The net morning it smelled horrible -- like butyric acid, so I know it got colder than the recommended temperature. But nonetheless I carried on!</p>

<p>I boiled the concoction for an hour and added some Simcoe and Centennial, and later WLP001. (Unfortunately I had to boil it inside the house because of the rain, and the whole house smelled like vomit for a week.) After fermentation was done, it did not taste very good. It still smelled pretty bad, and had a strong cheese taste. I thought all was lost, but then thought to try and add some brett (WLP650) a week later. That was on 2/24/2017.</p>

<p>I've been tasting it every so often, and I have noticed the smell and cheese taste have dissipated over the months. The main taste is <strong><em>very</em></strong> acidic/vinegary (pH was at 3.84 in August), but it is kind of rough by itself. Plus that faint cheese taste/smell that lingers. I'm thinking I can blend this with some other beer, but am also wondering if it is worth it. I have about 1.75 gallons worth.</p>

"Sanitizing: Does the same standard apply for ""DIY Juice alcohol""","<p>I'm new to the home-brewing process and I am attempting an experiment in which brewing yeast is added directly into juice for a period no longer than a week so that the yeast converts glucose into ethanol.</p>

<p>All of the tutorials I've seen documenting their process on <a href=""https://www.xojane.com/diy/make-alcoholic-juice-champagne-yeast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DIY juice home-brew (Linked from Life Hacker)</a> don't seem to mention any sort of sanitation process, yet most of the actual home-brewing guides like the one from the <a href=""http://chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/homebrewassoc/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/How-To-Extract.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Homebrewers Association</a> put a lot of emphasis on cleaning and sanitation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have spoken with a homebrewer about getting into the hobby, you've likely heard about the importance of cleaning and sanitizing. For many, sanitizing is the most important aspect of brewing. Unwanted yeast can contaminate beer if it is present in your carboy, on your

<ul>
<li>Obtain pure juice, typically over 20g of sugar per serving</li>
<li>Fill a container or carboy with juice (leave room as the fermenting process seems to raise the liquid level)</li>
<li><p>Directly add yeast to solution (it would appear the juice doubles as the ""wort""?)</p></li>

"Is there any permanent inhibition of maltase production in yeast by glucose","<p>Is is there any long term or ""memory effect"" on the expression of maltase in yeast that has been grown or mainly grown with glucose? In effect does yeast grown with glucose ""forget"" (or have some form of continuing metabolic impediment) how to metabolise maltose?
A somewhat technical question prompted by discussion elsewhere. Catabolic inhibition by glucose is well known and documented. Glucose is preferentially absorbed by yeast and an excess of it will repress the uptake and cleaving of maltose as a result. My understanding is that once the glucose is depleted (or drops below threshold levels) the yeast is once again free to transport maltose through the cell membrane and express maltase to catabolise it. Does anyone one know any different? </p>

"Table sugar + fruitjuice + yeast not fermenting","<p>After several years of beer brewing, I started experimenting with moonshine. I figured since Im distilling I dont have to deal with all the exacting procedures of beer making and I just needed basic sugar water to ferment and distill. So I did just that. I added 2 packages of white table sugar (<a href=""https://i.pinimg.com/236x/c5/a9/e0/c5a9e0778a611c8f8da53f1ec038ed2c.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/c5/a9/e0/c5a9e0778a611c8f8da53f1ec038ed2c.jpg</a>) and 4 gallons of fruit juice to a bucket of water mixed it and added yeast. I sed this high ABV distillers dry yeast (<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0064O77LQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064O77LQ</a>). The first time I did this the yeast went CRAZY! I had heavy foam coming out of the airlock! Ive never seen that before. The resulting 'beer' was fairly disgusting, but after distilling 2x made some great shine. </p>

<p>Fast forward to the 2nd time I did this, 4 months after the first time. I added the same yeast (which was sitting in an unrefrigerated ziplock bag) to the same wort. Hydrometer said it was supposed to be 15% ABV. This time however, the fermentation is going super slow, and pretty much stopped at 7.5%. The max rate of bubbles in airloc was 1 every 3 seconds - pretty slow even for beer. Thinking the yeast might've went bad, I added another yeast (<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0064O6Z4Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064O6Z4Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>). Still nothing. Its still fermenting but super slowly. Last check the hydrometer was at 5% ABV. This is after 2.5 weeks. </p>

<p>Whats going on?</p>

<p>Question 1: Can yeast process water + table sugar or does it need additional nutrients (ie like <a href=""https://beerandbrewing.com/what-exactly-is-yeast-nutrient/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://beerandbrewing.com/what-exactly-is-yeast-nutrient/</a>). Does fruit juice help? If so, why did the fermentation work so well last time?</p>

<p>250L @ 57C to mash in (for 10 mins).</p>

<p>Add 100L of hotter water @ X degrees C = 350L @ 66 degrees C (for one hour).</p>

<p>Add 150L of hotter water @ X degrees C = 500L @ 78 degrees C (for 15 mins).</p>

"Batch not carbonated/off flavor a week after bottling","<p>What does a home brew taste like if it is contaminated? I just bought a home brew kit about a month ago that came with a recipe for an Irish Red Ale. My beer has been bottled now for a week and upon testing one of my brews it didn't taste very good; it left a bad after taste and it is still flat. Has my beer been contaminated? Will it still carbonate? Is there still hope for my beer turning out alright?</p>

<p>I guess I was thinking there would be some sort of positive progress by now. Is the aftertaste or off flavor from contamination or does it just need more to mature? Also, does carbonation need the full two to three weeks before it begins to take effect at all? I'm afraid I may have missed on my very first batch. This wouldn't sit well with me since my dvd made the claim, ""if you can make mac and chesse you can make brew it's that simple"".</p>

"What are the primary causes of Acetaldehyde?","<p>I'm a bit confused about this.</p>

<p>In my own experience, I'm no longer experiencing acetaldehyde flavours in my beer after improving my aeration methods and at the same time starting to use yeast nutrient.</p>

<p>In his <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/IPA-Brewing-Techniques-Recipes-Evolution/dp/1938469003"">IPA book</a>, Mitch Steele says that the biggest cause by far of acetaldehyde comes from dying yeast cells from which acetaldehyde escapes.  It's also stated that acetaldehyde production increases with yeast cell growth - so aeration will increase acetaldehyde production.</p>

<p>I only use a primary fermentor, and it is always used for two week fermentations.</p>

<p>So, my theory to explain why I'm experiencing less acetaldehyde is that because I aerate better and provide a better environment to the yeast with yeast nutrient, there are fewer yeast cells dying at the end of fermentation.</p>

<p>Does this sound plausible?</p>

<p>Since aeration promotes acetaldehyde production, I think this also means I should be careful when dry-hopping to introduce as little air as possible to the fermentor.  Yes, it will be 'scrubbed' out by the yeast consuming it, but this also means the yeast are producing acetaldehyde.   I wasn't worried about introducing air when dry hopping before - because the common concern is oxidation, but it seems to me we should also be concerned about acetaldehyde when dry hopping.</p>

<p>The questions then are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does my explanation of experience less acetaldehyde seem plausible?</li>
<li>Should we worry about acetaldehyde production when dry-hopping?</li>

"Storing full kegs at room temperature","<p>So I have a related question <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/7823/temp-swings-and-forced-carbonation"">here</a>, but my questions are the following:</p>

<p>I only have one (and only have room for one) dedicated chest freezer/fridge for brewing.  I have one beer (Marzen) kegged and carbed (and in this chest freezer, chilled to 35).  I have another beer (IPA) cold-conditioning in the same chest freezer.  I would like to keg and carb the IPA for a competition that is one week from yesterday.  I would also like to brew a stout this weekend and control ferment temp, but if I carb up the IPA, I may be able to store it at the restaurant where the comp is in their cold storage walk-in.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1.)  If I store a keg at room temperature (that was carbed at 35*), pour into a growler and stick it in the fridge for serving, will it be overcarbed (since CO2 is more soluble at lower temps)?</p>

<p>2.)  If I were to let the carbed, chilled marzen warm up when I remove it from the fridge (as I need the fridge to control the ferment of my stout this weekend and into next week), I believe I do need to adjust the pressure to a higher PSI AND LEAVE THE CO2 hooked up, but if my fridge becomes available again and I can keep a keg in there, do I simply bleed the keg and dial the pressure back down?</p>

<p>3.)  Would I be able to keep a keg hooked up, carbed, and warm, and pour into a growler, chill and serve, or would it build up too much pressure while chilling in the growler?</p>

<p>Sorry if these are terribly involved questions, and I know, I probably should just stick to bottling until we move, but I have the kegs and thought I would give them some mileage.  </p>

"Fermentation Issues???","<p>Fermentation Help</p>

<p>I have need some thoughts on what I should do with this batch of beer. I am brewing a clone kit which is called Belgium Wit. The directions were a little off based on the equipment kit I had purchased, so I had to improvise.  To begin, I put the wort into a fermenting bucket ad sprinkled the dry yeast on top. The original thought was that it would be a 2 step fermentation process, as after a week, the plan was to transfer to a plastic carboy for another week, and then bottle.  (2 weeks fermentation total.)  Well, being a real newbie, I didn’t realize the bucket was supposed to have a lid and airlock. (Mine didn’t come with one so I had just covered my bucket with a towel so dust particles wouldn’t get in.)  So after about 14 hours there was a little bubbling that had taken place, but nothing like everyone describes. (Obviously) That’s when I realized I needed  the lid and air lock.  So after consulting with someone at a brewing store, they suggested that I siphon it into the carboy and then use the airlock. I did this and then within an hour or two, I noticed the bubbling and “foam” buildup everyone speaks of.  Here is what I need help with. After about 4 days, the bubbling started to decrease. I would say now, after 5 days, the bubbling has pretty much decreased and there is no foam or bubbles on the top. I decided to taste it, and everything seems fine. It tasted like a good, but flat beer, not sugary, but when I did a reading, this is where I got really confused.  The wort before fermentation was at 1.042.  Now, the reading is 1.076.  I thought it was supposed to be lower?  Like in the 1.012 range?</p>

<p>Before doing the reading, I was inclined to just let it go for the full 2 weeks in same fermenter and then bottle. The reading concerned me though.  Should I add more yeast?  If so, should I first siphon to a new carboy and then add the yeast?  Should I move it to a new carboy, but not add more yeast?  Should I go ahead and bottle? Or should I just leave it alone and continue as originally planned?</p>

<p>Sorry for all the newbie questions, but any help would be much appreciated!</p>

The freezer kicks on just as the A419 moves to 65 degrees as expected, but doesn't kick off until the freezer cools to around 55 degrees (or sometimes cooler).

The freezer runs for about 2 minutes before the A419 finally drops to 61 degrees and cuts off.  But after the freezer cuts off the temp reading on the A419 continues to drop as it ""catches up"" to the actual change in temp within the freezer.  Is this normal?

"Gross layer of foam at the end of fermentation and aging","<p>I experienced few times a gross layer of foam when fermentation finishes. But the beer was fine, no symptoms of contamination neither off-flavors. I never measure the depth of foam but it can have about 2 to 3 cm (among 1 inch). </p>

<p><strong>What can cause this ?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Is that explanation possible?</strong> : One of the explanations I found around the internet is that this foam is composed by dead yeasts, died by ""hydration shock"" when it is directly spread over the wort instead of pure water. This is strange to me, because although I use dry yeast spread directly over wort (at equivalent temperature), I think it would be necessary lots and lots of dead yeasts which isn't all of them within yeast packet. So, they would need to reproduce and dead yeasts don't reproduce, so the explanation about the ""hydration shock"" is very strange, which makes me think that if the foam is composed by dead yeasts the yeasts died after reproduction and not when spread over the wort.</p>

"Bottle Conditioning Lager with Priming Sugar and/or Yeast","<p>I've completed diacetyl rest and transferred to secondary 5 gallon carboy for lagering (say 3-5 weeks). After a few weeks lagering, I anticipate bottling but am curious how adding the priming sugar is going to result in better carbonation. I realize the priming sugar is to be processed by residual yeast, but after practically a month of lagering at 35 degrees F, I'm wondering if the carbonation is going to occur and how long it will take in the bottle. So here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Is it a good idea to add priming sugar after lagering completes and while bottling for conditioning?</p>

<p>2) Is it helpful to introduce additional yeast during bottling, or is there going to be enough residual yeast to handle the carbonation?</p>

<p>3) Could the lagering carboy be locked (with a plug to prevent escape) to introduce carbonation during lagering?</p>

"Struggling with acetaldehyde","<p>I recently started brewing and have completed three batches so far (Amber/Pale Ale). However, each batch seems to have that distinct green apple flavor to it. It's gone down a bit with each batch but even as my latest batch conditions I still smell a small amount of it. I've been reading forums and researching possible causes and still can't seem to fix this issue. Here's a summary of the latest batch:</p>

<p>-Grains steeped in 170F and boil done using malt extract.  </p>

<p>-Wort aerated with a stirring stick for about five minutes until a thick head of foam appears. OG reading of ~1.050  </p>

<p>-Wyeast smack pack is now ready after ~4 hours to get started, pitched in to ~70F wort in a plastic bucket.  </p>

<p>-Airlock activity starts ~12 hours later and lasts for ~24 hours before stopping.  </p>

<p>-A thick krausen forms and lasts for about a week before settling back down. ~10 days after pitching the FG reads ~1.010. Acetaldehyde smell is present by this point.  </p>

<p>-Wort is re-racked to a secondary for conditioning. It's been seven days since re-racking and I'm going to add the dry hops tonight.</p>

<p>What can I do to improve my process? Am I adding enough yeast? Should i use pure O2 for aerating? Would switching to an all-grain brew help? I've been meticulous about sanitizing with StarSan so I don't think sanitization is my issue. Any advice would be welcome, thanks!</p>

"Primary fermentation is still bubbling after 2 weeks. What are the consequences?","<p>This is my second batch in a row where I've seen primary go for over two weeks.  From my understanding, primary fermentation for an ale shouldn't take more than a couple of days (4-5 at most I believe).  As of tonight, it is still bubbling maybe once an hour, but it is definitely still fermenting.  When brewed, I used a yeast starter to increase the cell count, letting it set for approximately 20 hours before adding it to the wort.</p>

<p>Without further knowledge, I would guess I should let it complete no matter how long it takes, allow the diacetyl rest to finish, and then rack it, but this is at most, and uneducated guess.</p>

<p>As far as temperatures, it's been inconsistent.  I don't have any method of temperature control past setting the thermostat of my place, and due to having guests over in the fall season who can not understand or appreciate the importance of regulating temperatures when it comes to brewing, I've had the thermostat set anywhere between 68 degrees Fahrenheit to 74.  </p>

<p>My question is, what are the consequences for having it ferment this long? I've been told it's going to be dry, but past that, I don't know what I'm in for.  Am I going to get a buttery flavor from the warm fermentation temperatures?  Should I aim for the final gravity and just rack it to secondary?

"Adding coffee without secondary","<p>There are several questions about adding coffee, but the best results always seem to result from adding the coffee at secondary fermentation. I simply don't have a second vessel so this is not an option. So I'd be adding it at primary, and I've read that this will be subpar because the primary will blow off a lot of the coffee aroma. </p>

<p>One option is to add some cold brewed coffee right about at bottling time. But so far my results with adding flavor extracts at bottling time have been mediocre. The taste is usually front-loaded, and in fact mostly just aroma and doesn't seem present in the beer. My intuition is that infusing specialty ingredients earlier makes for a fuller taste, and that is what I want from this beer. But I don't want to sacrifice aroma, either.</p>

<p>So I have an idea: What if I added some coffee at the start of primary for a fuller flavor, and then added some more at bottling for aroma? I think it might work because people use a similar approach with hops (add some at the beginning of the boil for flavor and some at the end for aroma). Am I completely crazy or could this work?</p>

"What's the minimum amount of active dry yeast to start a ferment?","<p>So I've been experimenting with sugar washes and Fleishmann's active dry yeast which comes in little square packages. When you open the package and look in, the yeast is in the form of a powder of nearly spherical nodules. I'm sure since yeast are microscopic, then each of these nodules must contain hundreds of thousands if not millions or billions of the fungal spores. And since I know yeast reproduce exponentially the proof should just need enough of the nodules to ensure there is a low probability that all the yeast in a given nodule is dead or something, and enough time for the exponential function to take the starting population to the desired population. So my theory is that if the yeast double every two hours, and I pitch half a package, then I should see the same activity after 2 h, 15 min as I saw after 15 min of pitching the whole package. Or if I pitch 1/4096'th of the package and come back one day later (because 24 hours is like 12 doubling periods so 2^12=4096) then again assuming the small amount of the dry yeast was alive you'd see the same amount of life right?? The only experiments I've done with this is to put smaller and smaller amounts of the package into the starting 1/4'th of a cup of warm sugar water, and the less you put the less it does, and after a few hours if I didn't put enough then I give up and add the rest of the active dry yeast powder.</p>

"What lab equipment could be used to effectively ensure a quality home brew?","<p>For example how could you identify toxins in the simplest manner? I've got a few ideas such as microscopes and spectrometers. A microscope could be used to look at the morphological structure of what is growing in the batch, and if it looks like yeast it's more likely to be yeast, but short of sequencing the dna, how can you make sure there isn't some yeast impostor that looks and behaves similar to yeast but is actually producing some toxins? So I thought one could use spectrometers to measure the chemicals in the batch, and on the face of it I am thinking this is simpler than both dna sequencing and microscopic analysis. Even simpler one could measure the gravity of the solution and if you put sugar in and something is eating it up producing characteristic smells and moving the gravity towards that of water, it is more likely to be yeast. But I've read horror stories of people becoming paralyzed and even stopping breathing because botulinum toxin for example can be made along side the ethanol by bacteria who don't mind the yeast.

"Oxidation of red wine during racking and bottling","<p>I am making a red wine from grapes, the way I did it is, I let the grapes in the wine for 15 days before taking them out in order to extract more colour and tannins and then I racked the wine off its lees after 3 days. Although I was aware of the issue of oxidation when wine is exposed to air, at the time of racking I did not pay attention to it well and so my racking had lot of wine splashing in the carboy.Reading about the issue of oxidation online, I am quite worried if my wine would go bad. however I am also confused, I read in the link posted below that oxidation would be helpful in the case of red wines but not white. So could someone please clarify this? Do I need to be very cautious when bottling and storing or is exposure to air a good thing? (In red wines).

"Porter high OG with fermentation stopping at 1.030?","<p>I was doing a porter/stout with extract and also steeped milled smoked malt for a more smokey flavour as part of the process (steeped in warm water around mashing temperature for about 20 minutes before filtering out and adding it to the boil). (OG was 1.120) I fermented with Safale US-05.</p>

<p>Additionally after boil finished I added vietnamese coffee. Also one of my bags of hop pellets broke and some of the pellet residue got into the primary fermenter. </p>

<p>Today I tasted the beer and doesn't taste sweet, however the FG is now at 1.030. Wondering if this is stalled fermentation. Is it possible the beer is finished (based on my calculation the alcohol level should be 11.8% where Safale US-05 has max tolerance of 12%). </p>

<p>Is my beer finished fermenting or not (might be my OG and FG were higher due to the hop pellet residue and coffee?). I plan to leave it to climb from the 24 degrees it was fermenting at to 28 degrees?</p>

If possible, I'd like to do this without five separate boils.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to boil the hops in separate sauce pans of water and then add this hop water into the primary fermentor for different style?

"Fruit beer: should I allow it to ferment out completely?","<p>I have a wheat beer in secondary that has been on 5 lbs of strawberries for 6 days.  The flavor is phenomenal right now, just perfect.  The strawberries continue to ferment actively, and I want to make sure I don't miss a window where the flavor changes due to allowing the strawberries to ferment out completely.</p>

<p>I know from what I've read that the flavor will fade over a short time, even if the flavor is strong right now. But I don't expect this brew to stick around for long anyways (i.e. less than a month).  I want to capture this overwhelming fresh strawberry flavor while it lasts.  I should mention that the strawberry flavor isn't so much a ""sweet"" flavor, but more of a ""fresh"" flavor as you would get if you stuck your nose into a freshly picked bucket of strawberries and breathed deeply for a few minutes.</p>

<p>I used German ale yeast (Wyeast 1007) and have been fermenting cool for both primary and secondary, at around 58° F, with a 3-day diacetyl rest prior to racking onto the strawberries in secondary.  (OG:  1.066 ; FG prior to racking to secondary:  1.011.)  This yeast does really well at low temperatures, but it did take a few days before the strawberries started to visibly ferment.  At six days the fermentation is pretty vigorous.</p>

<p>Should I keg this now when I think the flavor is at it's peak or should I let the strawberries ferment out completely?  What would be the advantages and/or disadvantages of allowing it to finish fermenting the fruit?</p>

<p>NOTE:  Since I am kegging this rather than bottle conditioning, I don't have to be concerned about fermentation continuing in the bottle and potentially causing bottle bombs.  Any advice people can give me on this would not apply if I were bottle conditioning.</p>

"Kegging Vs Bottling in regards to Conditioning","<p>I recently started kegging, roughly 6 batches ago. Initially I would keg two batches and place them in the refridgerator, waiting two weeks for them to carbonate ""naturally"" (as opposed to ""forced"" carbonation) before I began drinking them.</p>

<p>Then the thought occurred to me that when I bottled, I still waited two weeks, but the bottles were at room temperature and not at 40 degrees in my refrigerator, as were my kegs. From what I remembered, beer which you let sit for a while in a bottle gets better as it ages because the yeast is still active and conditioning at room temperature.</p>

<p>For my next two batches that I was to keg, I then decided to leave the kegs and CO2 tank outside of the refrigerator for the two weeks of natural carbonation such that they could condition while at room temperature, instead of in the fridge.</p>

<p>Taking this to its logical conclusion, however, would result in the belief that kegging is inferior to bottling in regards to conditioning. After two weeks, I put the kegs back in the fridge, where the yeast become inactive and thus stop conditioning the beer. With bottling, I leave the bottles on a shelf for however long it takes me to drink all of the bottles. I simply move some bottles into the refrigerator several hours before I drink. And because I typically have 5 batches bottled at any given time, a single batch can last a long time if I rotate between each batch.</p>

<p><strong>Am I correct in thinking that if you keg a batch and store it in the fridge (or store all your bottles from a batch in the fridge) halt conditioning? Am I simply mistaken? Does conditioning, or the process by which aging beer makes it taste better, have nothing to do with yeast -- or does the yeast in a keg at 40*F continue to condition the beer?</strong> </p>

"First brew question","<p>I've moved the brew into a casket after the initial 4 days after seeing that the overall yeast had nearly stopped working. The cask is pressurized as expected from the CO2 (now @10 days). However I think I let the cask to cool down over a period of 4 days when I went off for a few days, so the FG is only just above the red on my hydrometer.<br>
Would putting the cask back into a warmer spot, start fermentation off again, with the residual yeast left in the beer? The reading before fermentation was 1.030 and is now showing 1.010, or just 2 notches above the red band, which If I'm right works out as a .020 difference making the alcohol level at 2.6%.?</p>

"Help needed with recipe translation","<p>I'm making the move from brewing all-grain kits to a ""full fledged"" recipe <a href=""http://beersmithrecipes.com/viewrecipe/710/prost-weizen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Weizen recipe"">Weizen</a>. However, I'm having trouble with some of the details: namely quantities and sparging. 
Some background: I've been doing small batches (4L) with fermentation on a demijohn. Only done 2 weiss so far. 
For those 4L, the instructions I had ask for 3L of mash water and 4L for sparging (which I do by slowly pouring the water over the sieved grain). 
I've found the following 5 gallon recipe which I was intending to follow and convert. 
My conclusions so far were (please correct me if I'm wrong):</p>

<p>Batch size: 4L. 
Boil size: 4.9L (amount of wort ready to be boiled). 
Ratio from 5 gallon to 4L is 5.683 (22.73L to 4L), which I used for converting grain and hops' quantities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheat malt: 400g</li>
<li>Pale malt: 320g</li>
<li>Hops: 2.5g + 2.5g</li>
</ul>

<p>My first question is, how much sparge water should I use? </p>

<p>I believe the method I've used so far is called partial boil since the (kit) recipe says to add remaining water to fermenter to make up for any loss. How easy it'll be to make it a full boil (as most people seem to consider it ""better"").

"Do you need to boil un-hopped extract?","<p>I'm doing an Epic Pale Ale clone with <a href=""http://www.wagonbrewing.co.nz/recipe-kits/clone-recipe-kits/epic-pale-ale-clone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this partial grain kit</a>. The kit includes two un-hopped liquid malt extract cans. Sterilisation aside, I want some clarification as to whether you should boil un-hopped malt extract.</p>

<p>In Randy Mosher's awesome <em>Radical Brewing</em> book he seems to say you do boil it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're an extract brewer, somebody has done all this work for you, and this is where you take over. </p>
  
  <p>The wort is transferred to a kettle and brought to a boil...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the Black Rock extract website, their <a href=""http://www.blackrock.co.nz/the-process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">process</a> shows that they already boil when making the extract. </p>

<p>The Beer and Wine Journal <a href=""http://beerandwinejournal.com/five-tips-for-extract/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extract brewers should boil the largest volume of wort they can
  manage, up to a full-wort boil. The more volume you boil, the less
  color pick up you will get. In addition, the corresponding lower
  specific gravity will increase your hop utilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but then in the very next paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brewery grade malt extract has already been boiled. It does not need
  to be boiled again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On here user <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/4578/13384"">jsled said</a> (see also brewchez's commnent)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do need to boil the hops in the presence of wort sugars to isomerize the hop oils to get bitterness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there seem to be two questions emerging here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you need to boil un-hopped malt extract? Why?</li>
<li>Do you need to boil hops in the wort? Why?</li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from jsled's comment about isomerization, all the other suggestions about boiling extract seem to be ""boil it in as much water as possible"" to get around the hop utilisation issues and colour pickup issues. If we get better hop utilisation boiling with lower SG, then the lowest of all will be... water. If we just don't boil the extract at all can't we simply avoid these concerns entirely?</p>

<p>For my two-cents, the best home-brew I ever made was a partial grain IPA where I didn't boil the extract and boiled the hop schedule separately in water. Even my sweet-mouthed malt-loving friends thought it was great. I'm sure Randy would approve as long as it tastes good, but I'm interested in understanding the chemistry.</p>

"Why does my lactobacillus batch smell so bad?","<p>I'm getting to be a fairly experienced brewer now but this is my first experiment with sours. I read about using lactobacillus from yoghurt so I thought I'd give it a bash.</p>

<p>The process so far... Simple all-grain mash, OG around 1.047. Sparged, raised to 80oC to pasteurise, then chilled to 30oC. Placed in a sanitised demijohn leaving the smallest possible air gap at the top. Just shy of 5 litres in total. Popped a bubble trap on then wrapped it with a heating belt to maintain 35oC. I cannot rule out the presence of oxygen.</p>

<p>I pitched in a 65ml pot of Yakult live yoghurt that apparently contains 6.5 billion lactobacillus casei. </p>

<p>After 12-18 hours there seemed to be gaseous fermentation going on - bubbles rising and a sort of small krausen formed. This puzzled me because I thought casei was homofermentative.</p>

<p>I couldn't resist popping out the bubble trap and having a sniff of the fermentation. Oh dear... I wish I hadn't done that. I was expecting to smell the beginnings of souring... What I actually smelt was an affront to my nostrils... The sort of smell that makes you pull away. Fetid, perhaps slightly fecal, or dead vegetation.</p>

<p>The fermentation appeared to stop after around 30 hours but the smell is still unpleasant. The gravity is still way up near 1.047 so if fermentation as I understand it took place there wasn't much action.</p>

<p>I have risked tasting the product and there is definitely some sourness there, but it's hard to get past the smell.</p>

<p>I'm now in day 3 and the demijohn is just sitting there looking completely inactive... So I sit and wait. It's around pH 3.5.</p>

<p>My plan is to boil the soured wort to drop the break out and kill the lacto, add some late addition hops, and then pitch saccharomyces as normal.</p>

<p>So I guess my questions are...</p>

<p>What is that smell, and is it normal?
Will the smell disappear?
Will the boil get rid of the smell?
If I wasn't going to boil it would be smell disappear?
Why did it appear to ferment?</p>

<p>Thanks already for your help! :)</p>

<p>/* EDIT */</p>

<p>I boiled it today, about 3.5 days (80 hours) after first pitch the lactobacillus. There's a strong sourness on the palate but it's not lip-puckering. No bittering hops so it was just a quick 45 minutes boil.</p>

<p>The nasty smell certainly mellowed but didn't disappear completely. It's no longer overpoweringly unpleasant but now just a funky 'note' of the aroma profile. </p>

<p>Steeped 30g First Gold whilst I was chilling it back into a different, sanitised demijohn. Pitched a stack of Nottingham dried for a nice quick fermentation.</p>

<p>/* EDIT */</p>

<p>OK - fermentation over. FG dropped to 1.011 - ABV 4.3%. That hideous smell has mellowed a lot but not completely disappeared. It is still detectable but not unpleasant.</p>

<p>Bottled a week ago but couldn't resist popping a bottle today. Obviously carbonation is poor but it's a lovely refreshing sharpness. On the whole, very pleased. I'll be trying this again.</p>

"Adding sugar to an imperial stout","<p>I did not fly sparge properly, undershooting the preboil gravity by quite a bit, and ended up using more sparge water to extact sugars. I then reduced away most of the additional water, and ended up with an OG of about '87 (with a somewhat bigger volume). The target was 1.1. I'm thinking about adding sugar, honey or similar to the primary fermentation (going on as we speak) to get it up to or closer to this level.</p>

<p>My question is fairly general: What might I expect from doing this? From what I understand, I'll need to add almost a kilo of, say, honey to achieve this. BeerSmith warns me that this will lover the estimated FG from '18 to '15. Does this seem reasonable? One of my main reasons for considering this is I still used the same amount of hops, and having first worted quite a bit of it I'm a bit concerned about balance (with the greatly increased boil time). Furthermore, I want the brew to be heavy for the winter months.</p>

"When am I supposed to add my dark grains","<p>Is the simplest answer:  ""if it has a husk and its dark, add it at sparge""?</p>

<p>I have made 40 or so batches of beer, but not a lot of stouts.  I have heard Jamil and others saying that they mash all grains for the full 60 minutes, but have heard of others adding dark grains at sparge.

Maybe the sparge add is a better move for Black IPAs, porters, and beers with the guidelines calling for a more subtle roast character?  </p>

<p>I have a batch of Canadian breakfast stout conditioning where I added all dark grains at sparge (carafa III, black patent), and it doesn't have much roast in my preliminary samples.  Maybe I need to wait until its carbed and ready for serving until I decide which suits my palette.  </p>

"My beer is not carbonating in my Keg","<p>Since I have read so much about how much easier it is to keg your homebrew rather then bottle it, I decided to go ahead and get myself a kegging system setup.</p>

<p>So, last week, after my beer was done fermenting, I went ahead and racked it into the keg and put it into my fridge over night. I should add that the beer I brewed is a highly carbonated Bavarian Hefeweizen.  I have brewed and bottled this style of beer with success several times before. It is my favorite.<br>
Anyway, on Saturday after the beer in the keg cooled down to serving temperature I went ahead and hooked up my CO2 tank to the dip tube and dialed the pressure up to 30 psi and started rocking it back and forth like I was supposed to for about 10-15 min.
I then put the keg back in the fridge and left the pressure at 30 psi. for 5 more days.
On the fifth day I decided to test my beer since I didn’t wanted to end up and over carbonate it.<br>
To my surprise, it was barely carbonated?? Did I do something wrong?
I read before, that if you don’t force carbonate and just let the keg sit in the fridge with the CO2 hooked up it takes about 4-5 days for it to carbonate. 
Well, I kind of did both, and didn’t get much carbonation from it. I thought, maybe it just takes longer then usual since it is a Hefeweizen.

"When is aeration good and/or bad in homebrewing?","<p>I had thought that the point of using a siphon when moving wort/beer is to prevent agitation and aeration and a ruined beer. So we use the siphon when moving cooled wort to the carboy for fermentation, when moving the fermented beer to the secondary fermenter and then lastly when moving the beer to the bottling bucket. However, I recently talked to another homebrewer who would strive for maximum agitation when pitching their yeast so the yeast is really integrated. That really confused me.

"New to Kegging - Help","<p>Just moved to a new house and finally have room for a chest freezer so I can switch from bottling to kegging. 
I have a johnson digital temp controller to regulate the freezer so I can keep constant temps. 
First question is what is the best temp to store kegs at?</p>

<p>Secondly I have a friend that has been brewing for 13years and from what I have read online, his kegging process seems slightly different than everyone else.</p>

<p>Here is what he does:
After he has sanitized and transferred the beer into his keg he sets his pressure at 30psi and shakes the keg for at least 5mins until you no longer hear any gas flwoing into the keg.
He puts it into his chest freezer and turns off the CO2.
Then everyday for about a week he will open up the regulator (I can't remember if its still set to 30psi or if he drops it to around 12psi) at least 3 times a day and lets the gas flow until you hear it stop flowing into the keg. 
Then after a week its carbonated and he unhooks the CO2 and never hooks it back up when he wants to dispense beer from his picnic tap.</p>

<p>Now from what I keep reading online a lot of people leave the CO2 hooked up and gas flowing while its in the chest freezer for a few days to carbonate it. 
And they also hook the CO2 back up when they want to dispense their beer.
But, his way seems to be working for him for years.</p>

Would this work?</li>

"Is degassing wine really necessary?","<p>Last year (2016) I made a small batch of wine from my own grapes. I started out mostly ignorant of most things regarding wine making (I had already been homebrewing AG since 2015), and what I read confused me more.</p>

<p>So I had this thing of ""f**k this"", I will start with it and see what I can do. So the only things I bought were a bag of wine yeast and a bottle of pectinase enzyme. All the rest I had from brewing. The only advice I followed was from a blog, where the writer advised to store the wine cool in order to clear it. </p>

<p>Which is what I did, and in March I had a really nice wine, which I then already bottled, being ignorant of the fact most wines are kept over summer. However, tannins had dropped out beautifully, and it was perfect. I also did not add sulphite, being ignorant of the issue. There were only six bottles, and we drank them all.</p>

<p>So, there was indeed one thing, and that was that it was not degassed. However, I get the impression that this issue is really exaggerated on the web. There is no fizz or sparkle, just a light taste of something that you know is carbon dioxide on the palate. And after five minutes after being poured out is has mostly disappeared.</p>

<p>So why do people whisk their wine? Does their wine really contain that much gas (which for me would be the levels of Lambrusco), or is it just because ""reasons""?</p>

<p>Would my wine have been mostly degassed because of the racking before bottling?</p>

<p>In this recipe once fermentation begins you feed the plant sugar and ground ginger for 7 days.

I'm also not sure what a good ratio of ginger to liquid is.

"Making a melomel cyser","<p>This is my first post here but I've read a few posts for reference on my first few brews. I have now made 5 gallons of cider using 5 different yeasts. Two of them I really liked and plan to experiment a bit more with them next year using honey instead of brown sugar on some batches before primary fermentation. </p>

<p>So my question is, how is making a cyser different from just a regular cider? What steps are involved? What ratio of honey to cider should I use as a baseline? (Like I had read somewhere it's about 3/4 water and 1/4 honey for a mead)</p>

<p>Also, continuing along this line of thought, if I used a cherry blossom honey (just an example), how well does the flavor of the honey come through? I'm thinking of using a Ghost chili infused honey on one gallon, a mango infused on a second gallon, and an Orange blossom honey for a third.</p>

I will add 4 oz of <a href=""http://www.brewersbestkits.com/natural-flavorings.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brewer's Best apricot flavouring</a> as well as my priming sugar to the bottling bucket before I bottle.</p>

"Formulating a recipe with birch sap","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Based on my searching here and elsewhere, brewing with birch sap is quite uncommon with brewers (although I did find one brewer that mentioned <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/5501/1643"">brewing with maple sap</a>).   So I'd like to get a list of things to think about as I develop a beer recipe based on birch sap.  Brewing with sap is different than using syrup because knowing the flavor of the sap once concentrated is unknown in the case of using sap.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Gravity / Flavor Concentration</strong></p>

<p>From what I have been able to ascertain so far, the sap, right out of the tree is in the 1.004 to 1.007 range.  One approach would be to heat the sap and use it as my mash and sparge water.  In that case, there may be very little birch flavor in the final product.  On the other end of the spectrum would be to gently evaporate<sup>1</sup> the sap until the specific gravity gets to a place that would make a beer on it's own, without grain.  That would yield the strongest birch flavor, but might be ""too much"".</p>

<p><strong>Flavors</strong></p>

<p>I have tasted birch sap out of the tree<sup>2</sup>, and it's almost like pure water, but I don't know how the flavor would change if the sap was concentrated by evaporation.  Based on what that taste would be, then hops could be selected that would mesh appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Fermentability</strong></p>

<p>If the out-of-the-tree specific gravity is, say, 1.005, is there any way to tell how much of that will be fermentable sugars, and what will be left as residual sweetness?  Or even how much of that gravity is caused by dissolved sugars versus something else (minerals?).</p>

<p><strong>Recipe Guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Are there any rules of thumb for birch sap based beer recipes?  Or rules of thumb from maple sap based beer recipes?  What techniques could be employed to select a reasonable starting point for the brewing of a birch sap beer?  </p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>

<p><sub>
1. Boiling apparently causes a poor shift in flavor towards ""burnt""
</sub></p>

<p><sub>
2. I cut a branch off of a river birch tree in my yard last spring and the sap dripped for weeks.  I had to taste it.

"Flavor effects of adding yeast energizer or nutrient to beer?","<p>My understanding is that generally (with the possible exception of starters) yeast nutrient and energizer are not really needed for beer, as the barley provides basically everything required.</p>

<p>However, is there any possible downside to adding them?  Obviously using it when it adds no value is wasteful but is there anything in yeast nutrient or yeast energizer that would adversely affect the beer if too much is present in the final product?</p>

<p>On the other end, the yeast energizer I have lists its ingredients as diammonium phosphate, Springcell, and magnesium sulfate.  Of these, magnesium sulfate sticks out as something that might benefit hoppier beers. I would imagine the amount in the yeast energizer would be relatively small, but maybe they could be high enough to make a noticeable difference?</p>

<p>More generally, are there any possible flavor impacts of yeast nutrient or yeast energizer if added to an otherwise normal batch of beer?  I'm mostly thinking all-malt beer, but if this might be different for wheat beer or similar then I would be interested in that as well.</p>

"What does ""a thorough diacetyl rest"" mean when talking about ale yeast?","<p>Most of my knowledge of diactyl rests come from Palmer's <em>How to Brew</em>, and it applies entirely to lagers. It mainly means bringing the temperature up slowly and letting the lager sit at a slightly higher temperature for a couple of days so the yeast consume the diacetyl produced in the cold fermentation.</p>

<p>Wyeast <a href=""http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=22"" rel=""nofollow"">recommends a thorough diacetyl rest with their ESB yeast</a>, though, and I wonder what in the heck this means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A very good cask conditioned ale strain, this extremely flocculant yeast produces distinctly malty beers. Attenuation levels are typically less than most other yeast strains which results in a slightly sweeter finish. Ales produced with this strain tend to be fruity, increasingly so with higher fermentation temperatures of 70-74°F (21-23° C). A thorough diacetyl rest is recommended after fermentation is complete. Bright beers are easily achieved within days without any filtration.</p>

"How much distillers yeast do I use in a 5 gallon batch of beer?","<p>The recipe I'm working on calls for the use of distillers yeast half way through my primary fermentation (among other things like plenty of sugar, aeration, etc...).  Problem is, it doesn't really specify how much I should use.  I picked up a 1 lb bag of Crosby &amp; Baker's distillers yeast, and plan to get a starter going with it.  Only problem is, I highly doubt I am supposed to use an entire lbs when adding it in.</p>

<p>To put some perspective on how much sugar is going into it, I'm waiting for the vigorous primary fermentation to calm down, then plan to add sugar daily, in the amount of 1 oz. per day (cane or demerara, alternating), for five days.  After that cools off, I transfer the beer out of the carboy to rid of the dead yeast cells, add the distillers yeast, aerate, then put back into the cleaned out carboy and continue to add 1 oz. of sugar for another five days before I transfer to secondary to let it sit for several weeks.</p>

<p>How much distillers yeast should I add to this batch based off of the size and the amount of sugar?</p>

<p>I probably should have brought up the target 14-16% ABV part.

  the point that you can make this hop addition. </p></li>
  <li><p>20 minutes before the end of the boil, add the Chinook hop pellets, 1/2 pound of cane sugar, and the irish moss, stir for one minute.</p></li>
  <li><p>10 minutes before the end of the boil add 1/2 pound of demerara sugar and stir for 1 minute. </p></li>
  <li><p>At the 60 minute mark of the biol turn off the heat source. Stir the wort clockwise for 2 minutes as you build up a whirlpool effect.
  Stop stirring and allow the wort to sit for 10 minutes. </p></li>
  <li><p>Chill the wort in a cold water bath to a temperature of 70 - 75 F (21 - 24 C)</p></li>
  <li><p>Transfer the wort into a carboy. Add the yeast nutrient. </p></li>

  <li><p>After the vigorous primary fermentation slows down (around 8 - 10 days) you will hear the airlock bubbling less frequently. Once this

  straight. </p></li>
  <li><p>A few days after the primary fermentation slows down, transfer your beer into the sterilize bottling bucket while you clean out the

"Should I worry about blow-off?","<p>I brewed a batch of IPA yesterday and when I checked on it today it had started to blow-off.  There is so much pressure in the primary that it has spilled up through the airlock and is constantly whistling.  Should I be concerned about this?  Is there anything I should do to correct it?</p>

<p>The beer is a modified version of this recipe: <a href=""http://hbd.org/discus/messages/15516/16500.html?1054613895"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://hbd.org/discus/messages/15516/16500.html?1054613895</a></p>

<p>The modification was to use liquid malt extract instead (10 lbs) and substituted Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) and was made at the recommendation of my local homebrewing store.</p>

"Pitched unnecessary 2nd round of yeast - what will be the effects?","<p>First off, a bit of background:</p>

<p>This is my 3rd batch of homebrew so I am new to this. I'm using the following: Morgan's Golden Saaz Pilsner can of goo, Fermentis Saflager s-23 yeast and a brew booster (Dextrose, malt and corn syrup).</p>

<p>After 2 weeks there was still no bubbling in the airlock so I decided that the yeast must have died and I pitched a 2nd round of yeast and while doing so I noticed a thin rim of krausen on the side of the fermenter. 3 days later there is still no bubbling in the airlock. </p>

<p>I finally realized I should check the specific gravity and noticed it had gone from 1035 down to 1010. </p>

<p>My plan is to bottle a 6 pack and rack the rest off then see how the bottled brew turns out before investing the time in bottling the whole lot.</p>

<p>So, my question(s) is this:</p>

<p>What will the 2nd round of yeast do to this batch? Is it salvageable or should I not waste time with bottling?</p>

"Adding gypsum after fermentation","<p>I have found resources that both advocate and highly advise against this practice.  We recently brewed a IIPA (Bear Flavored's Heady Topper clone) that has 3lbs of hops, plus hop extract in 14 gallons.  We didn't add any gypsum to our 4ppm sulfate water.  I want to make this the best beer possible.  I tried adding untreated gypsum to a prior IIPA (in the glass) and wasn't thrilled with the results.  </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>-Why does adding gypsum to the strike water/mash differ from adding it to the glass, or to the beer post fermentation?
-Would there be any way to mimic adding it to the mash after fermentation?  Maybe making a heavily gypsum-ized starter beer, fermenting it, and blending?
-What about adding gypsum to boiling water, chilling and adding that to the beer?  Does boiling salts change the way they behave on the palette or diffuse into the beer?</p>

"Using 5L oak barrel for beer","<p>I was recently given a 5L oak barrel from <a href=""http://oakbarrelsltd.com/"">Oak Barrels Ltd.</a> and I've never used such a thing before and have some basic questions.</p>

<p>The barrel came with a great little <a href=""https://oakbarrelsltd.com/files/Instructions%20&amp;%20Barrel%20Prep.pdf"">instruction guide</a> which talks about basic barrel prep, sanitation, and storage (among other things). Also on their website they link to this article by Terry Terfinko from 1995 titled, <em><a href=""http://realbeer.com/spencer/Experiments/oak-barrel.html"">Oak Barrel Experiment</a></em>, which answers a lot of questions about beer making with barrels. However there are a few pieces of the puzzle missing:</p>

<ol>
<li>5L (1.3 gal) vs 5 gal: I have 5 gallon batch equipment currently. Should I invest in some stuff like 1 gallon carboys and mini auto-siphons for smaller batches? Should I scale recipes which are for 5 gal down to smaller sizes by just dividing everything by 5? </li>
<li>The instruction guide mentions the idea of ""topping off"" the barrel from time to time. This is because of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel#Angels.27_share"">Angel's share</a>, that being the beer/wine/whiskey that evaporates during the aging process. So how do I do this with beer? Do I need to keep some extra beer around somewhere (refrigerated?) maybe in growlers or something? This may play into the answer to the first question about batch size.</li>
<li>I've been doing extract brewing (with grain bags in there too) so far and don't have all grain equipment, I assume that won't be a problem. I guess the question is, will it (be a problem)?</li>
<li>Any suggestions on kind of beer to make? I thought stuff like a Russian imperial stout or Scotch Ale or some other strong ale might be good. But most of those say to age for 6 months minimum and the guide suggests 4-6 weeks aging for the 5L barrel. Maybe just some basic brown ale for the first time, since they're usually pretty cheap and easy to make.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this longer post. I'm excited to start trying this thing out but without answers to some of these questions, I'm a bit nervous about messing it up (I know, <a href=""http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/RDWHAHB"">RDWHAHB</a>).</p>

I put 1 1/2 brown sugar (Even though some fell off to the side cause I didn't dissolve it, like the twit I am). I would say that MAYBE a cup of brown sugar is in there. Regardless, I read that it may just make it drier but I wanted to know if this may effect the fermentation process. Also, I had to open it during the first few hours to drain some out cause it was about to pop the cap open (overfilled it, we're talking 1 gallon of pure apple juice here, plus sugar, plus the foam from the fermentation). I was worried it would cause an explosion, but even though it seems to be in control, I'm worried that I may have damaged the batch.</p>

"Rescuing a weak lager fermentation","<p>I'm currently fermenting a spiced dark lager with an original gravity of 1.064. I began fermentation 2 weeks ago today with a White Labs 830 yeast that I made a starter with. The yeast was a bit old, so I wanted to make sure the starter was going well before I pitched it into the wort. However, this was my first starter (and lager for that matter), so I may not have produced a large enough yeast batch. Fermentation did start vigorously within about 12 hours after pitching.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, all signs of fermentation have slowed dramatically. The airlock passes a bubble maybe once every 5 minutes. Taking a specific gravity reading shows a steady level of 1.0333 which gives an attenuation of only about 40-45%.

"Cider molding and wont go away but not getting worse?","<p>I have three ciders going, two ""spiced"" ciders and one regular/standard whatever the straight apple squeezed cider (""Ryan's"" brand if anyone is familiar) is called. This is my first attempt at cider, didn't do much research just got a great deal on cider.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>Is my cider done for? can I rack it off the mold? is it safe to drink? what can I do?</p>

<p><strong>HERE'S THE SIMPLE STORY:</strong></p>

<p>The cider was on sale because it was close to ""sell by"" date but not expired yet, when I opened the half gallon jugs a couple of them had small chunks of mold on them. Because I had high hopes I just picked out the mold and dumped it in assuming the yeast would kick out some alcohol and protect it from any mold.</p>

<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong></p>

<p>Well I would be writing if that were the case, one started molding right away (""spiced"" on Lalvin D47 (Dry wine yeast)) o.g. was 1.052 and currently is 1.002, smells very moldy but looks very clear. when poured into graduated cylinder it appeared to be carbonated I would say around 3 volumes (yes airlock was used). the mold covers about half surface area, and is thin and white (Thicker and white then a Pellicle)<br>
The second was a non-""spiced"" on the same yeast, and it only has what I would describe as a pre-mold coagulated chunk 1"" by 3"" (very small in comparison) o.g. was 1.056 now is 1.002. small hint of mold smell but mostly spice cider smell.<br>
The third is a ""spiced"" cider on 100% Brett B, this one was the last to mold but has a slightly thicker mold and also blue and white and covers an area about 2"" by 2"". This one also cleared out very well but has zero attenuation, started at 1.052 and is currently the same.</p>

<p><strong>FERMENTATION:</strong><br>
(all three fermented in the same conditions and in glass) started fermentation around the low 60's for about two weeks then moved into an area 68-70 deg for the remaining week and a half.</p>

"House's furnace died while fermenting, what should I do?","<p>I'm doing my first homebrew (using <a href=""http://brooklynbrewshop.com/beer-making-kits/everyday-ipa-1-gal-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">this kit</a>), and started fermentation 6 days ago. I've kept it in my basement, which is usually around 66F. The kit's instructions just tell me to let it ferment in a dark place for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Yesterday my furnace went out, and the temperature's dropped to about 55F. Is this going to affect the brew? If it drops to the low 50s for the next couple days, will it ruin the batch?</p>

<p>I could move the carboy to a friend's apartment where it's warmer, but will moving it be worse than letting it get cooler?</p>

"First Brew: Yellow Mold - Transfer to Carboy - Slowing of Fermentation","<p>I brewed a batch of Pale (first solo brew) and after pitching yeast (6 hours), noticed yellow clusters of what I think was mold.  I thought I had an infection, so I siphoned off, and collected supernatant in clean carboy (trying hard not to interrupt the surface where most of the visible yellow clusters were).</p>

<p>Fermentation ramped up and was vigorous all day yesterday (brewed on Sunday) but a day later, today, I noticed visibly that it slowed.  Now, I know fermentation is still going because I see bubbles, but what could be gong on here?  I've seen other beers rage for 2-3 days before slowing like this...</p>

<p>New to brewing so I haven't really seen anything like this.  Good news is that I no longer see any yellow.</p>

<p>Not sure how I contaminated the beer, or if was even me...  Probably was, but that's not really important:  I will try even harder next time to be clean.  What I'm getting at is can mold cause slowing of fermentation and if so, what should I do - wait?  Anything else I should keep in mind?  Will it taste funny when done, etc?</p>

"Using hops after fermentation","<p>Let's say you have already put your beer into your fermenter and you decide its taste is not hoppy enough. So you start out to add some more hops into it. One way to dry hop, but I will not expand concerning it. The method I would like to discuss is boiling your hops in a small amount of water, waiting for it to reach room temperature and then pour your ""tea"" into your second fermenter before you close it. The question is: how good are the results of this? Do the same boiling rules for hops appear here too (ie, 60 minutes for bitterness, 30 for flavour or 15 for aroma)?</p>

"What would cause yeast to fail to flocculate?","<p>I am using WLP002 - English Ale Yeast - in my current batch, a Young's double chocolate clone.  According to <a href=""http://www.whitelabs.com/beer/strains_wlp002.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the manufacturer's product page</a>, this yeast is highly flocculant.</p>

<p>The beer remained in the primary for 15 days.  After this time, the gravity had fallen from an OG of 1.070 to 1.021.  This is a 70% apparent attenuation, which is the top end of the expected range for this yeast.  There was a <em>lot</em> of yeast still floating on top of the beer, but I racked to the secondary anyway.  Here is <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/xyODt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a picture of the secondary</a> after three days.  That is yeast on top.  Last night, after two weeks in the secondary I used a small spoon to pull a bunch of this out and verified by smell that it is definitely yeast.  I also took another gravity reading and found that it fell from 1.021 to 1.018 in the secondary.  I now have an apparent attenuation of 74.2%, kind of high for this yeast.  Yet, the yeast remains atop the beer.</p>

<p>Why is the yeast not flocculating?  Might it be that the high amuont of lactose (12 oz.) and/or cocoa powder (6 oz.) in the beer is making the beer more dense than the yeast?  I'd like to see this yeast fall to the bottom before I bottle, else it will end up slurrying the beer.</p>

"Using Grolsch ""Premium Lager"" bottles for bottling","<p>In my first bottling, I decided I wanted to try using half normal reused glass bottles with new bottle caps and half reused Grolsch beer bottles.</p>

<p>Probably the worst part of the process was having to drink the Grolsch beers. They are horrible and half of them were skunky (could it be because of the green bottle versus brown?), and the other half just weren't good at all. What I noticed was that all of the normal bottles that I cleaned and sanitized tasted fine, but the Grolsch bottles tasted skunky, but only at the top of the bottle. Once I had been drinking a little bit further into the bottle, the skunkiness went away. Before I bottled it, it was hard to make sure the cap was fully sanitized. I closed the bottle with the sanitizer in it, and tipped the sanitized solution toward the cap.</p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed this problem with using Grolsch beer bottles? Are they just not a very good bottle to use? I think after my experience, I would not recommend them.</p>

"Adding priming sugar to lagering secondary","<p>A few weeks ago, I brewed a Belgian double, its done fermenting and ready for the next step. I've noticed that the beer is still very cloudy so I prefer a cold-crash/lagering period before bottling first.</p>

<p>Now the 'problem': I don't want to transfer the beer twice ( primary -> sec -> bottling ) because of the increased risk of contamination, but also the extra work and time involved. I've cold crashed in the primary before, but once the beer is transferred afterwards, some trub and yeast still comes along and the beer would still be hazy. </p>

<p>So I thought, why not add the priming sugar to the secondary, let it cold crash with the sugar and then bottle? </p>

<p>My theory is that the yeast would not be active at the close to freezing point temperatures. After bottling the beer warms up and the sugars get fermented. I would let the beer already cool down in the primary, so once it is combined with the sugar it is is already cool. </p>

<p>In section 13, it says something along the lines of ""Add the hops after 10 days ... the hops are added by placing the tea bag into a cup of boiling water...then add the contents of the cup including the tea bags to the fermenter.""</p>

<p>Now my primary fermentation vessel has a handy tap on the side so I never take the lid off to check gravity during my brews. I'll have to break the rules for these instructions which means air and germs will get into the wort. How much of a risk is this? How can I minimise the contamination? Why do we even have air locks if we are in the habit of removing bucket lids during fermentation?</p>

<p>I'm still a bit new to this but this basic question has always vexed me.</p>

"Why are some of my batches too sweet in the bottle, and can I rescue them?","<p>I've had pretty good success brewing kits generally, but towards the end of last year I went on a mission brewing a few batches in fairly rapid succession.  Unfortunately for me, most of the resultant brews have come out too sweet and slightly flat in the bottle.  They all seemed to ferment out completely (as measured by hydrometer).</p>

<p>This has happened to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woodfordes Admiral's Reserve, brewed in October '15, bottled in November</li>
<li>Young's American Pale Ale, brewed in Oct '15, bottled in November</li>
<li>Brewferm Diablo, brewed in Aug '15, bottled in October</li>
<li>Brewferm Triple, brewed in Jun '15, bottled end July</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time I've had some brews behave perfectly - St Peters Ruby Red Ale (Dec), Woodfordes Nog (Sep), Brewferm Abdij (May), Better Brew Czech Pilsner (Aug), and another Young's American Pale Ale (June).  I've previously brewed the Admiral's Reserve with no problems too.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> what might be happening is the newly-filled bottles might be being stored too cold to allow proper bottle conditioning.  Our house is quite cold in the winter months (my wife doesn't put the heating on unless it's about 16 deg C indoors) and most of the failures were in the Oct - Dec bottling timeframe.  I just put the bottles high in the conservatory thinking it would be warm there, but actually it's not really.  I wondered if this might be the case and put the Ruby Red Ale into the cupboard as below a day after I'd bottled it, and it's mostly okay.</p>

<p>I tried to rescue the Admiral's Reserve and the American Pale Ale by bringing them into a warm place for a while (cupboard with fan heater, kept at approx 21 deg C).  However no joy - I wonder if the yeast had given up the ghost by then.</p>

<p>Can I rescue these brews?  Possibly by venting, bringing up to a warm temperature and adding some fresh yeast?  My wife quite likes the sweet Triple so I'm not too worried about that, and probably the Diablo as it's very similar.</p>

<p>Full notes from the failed brews are below (sorry for the long post!):</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Woodfordes Admiral's Reserve</strong></p>

<p>10 Oct 15 Brewed as per instructions to 18 litres. Starting gravity 1.052.  On floor of the conservatory with heat belt, temperature over fermentation between 22 and 24.</p>

<p>23 Oct 15 Checked SG - was 1.012.  Still a few bubbles.</p>

<p>27 Oct 15 Checked SG - was still 1.012.  Still the odd bubble as well.  Racked to secondary which also bubbled.  Notes from last time said it was still bubbling slightly after 4 weeks but SG had got down to 1.005!</p>

<p>06 Nov 15 SG now 1.010, so 5.5% abv (5.7% with priming sugar).  Bottled with 75g of sugar into 31 500ml bottles, put at top of conservatory to condition.</p>

<p>21 Nov Bottles pretty cold in conservatory so taken to airing cupboard with fan heater, held at approx 21 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Young's American Pale Ale</strong></p>

<p>27 Oct 15 Brewed short to 20 litres instead of 23, SG was 1.060ish.  Put vessel on floor of conservatory with heat belt.</p>

<p>09 Nov 15 Vessel still bubbling.  Have twice tapped on the lid to displace water droplets which fall back into the wort and seem to kick things off again.</p>

<p>10 Nov 15 Measured SG at 1.004! That gives a current ABV of 7.4%! Added hops as it has pretty much stopped bubbling.</p>

<p>12 Nov 15 Transferred to secondary.</p>

<p>17 Nov SG probably 1.005 actually.  Is about 7.4% including priming sugar. Batch primed with 90g of the sugar (100g was supplied but I'd brewed short) into 29 500ml bottles and 9 330ml bottles.</p>

<p>21 Nov Bottles pretty cold in conservatory so taken to airing cupboard with fan heater, held at approx 21 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Brewferm Triple</strong></p>

<p>1 Jun 2015 (or 4 Jun) Two kits brewed full to 18 litres with 1kg of light dry malt extract.  OG not taken.</p>

<p>27 Jun (approx) Tested, still at 1.020.  Gave a good stir.</p>

<p>15 Jul Stuck at 1.020 so added Belgian ale yeast (Mangrove Jacks M27 Belgian Ale Yeast). Airlock activity by the end of the evening.  More airlock activity the next day, looks like it might have restarted.</p>

<p>29 Jul Gravity down to 1.011 - 1.012 so transferred to bottling bucket.  Temperature was 18 degrees.  Was a bit left over on the trub but tried to keep yeast out of the beer.  Beer was a bit cloudy, but not excessive.  Bottled into 30 33cl Duvel-style bottles, 8 33cl Leffe bottles and 7 50cl bottles (one half full).  Primed as per instructions with 7g of sugar per litre, so 100g for 15 litres indicated (all that was remaining after testing and leaving some on the trub).  I wonder if this might be too much sugar?</p>

<p><strong>Brewferm Diablo</strong></p>

<p>06 Aug Two kits brewed full to 18 litres with 1kg of light dry malt extract.  Starting temperature 26 degrees, OG 1.073ish, not easy to tell as head very full even in testing tube.  Airlock bubbling the next morning.</p>

<p>17 Sep (ish) Gravity still at 1.020 so added Mangrove Jacks M27 Belgian Ale yeast.  Noted temperature was down at about 17 or 18 degrees C so put on brewbelt.  Next evening it was bubbling again and up at about 25 degrees, so brewbelt loosened a bit.</p>

<p>02 Oct Transferred to secondary.  Gravity 1.012ish.</p>

<p>07 Oct Primed with 112g demerara sugar into 48 330ml bottles. FG 1.012, so 8% (8.2% with priming sugar).  Up on to conservatory shelf to warm condition, although it's pretty cold inside at the moment.</p>

"What is this husk-like material in allegedly de-husked Carafa 3 Special?","<p>I'm brewing Black IPA. So I needed less bitter black malt. My choice was Carafa III Special - it is supposed to be de-husked kind. But it looks like this:

<p>What is it? It looks kinda like husk pieces. But there should be no husk pieces in this malt. Does this malt always look like that, and what part of grain actually forms these flakes? Or maybe shopkeeper just made a mistake, as he weights and packs malts on demand.</p>

"What to do with not so de-husked Carafa 3 when brewing black AIPA?","<p>I bought what was supposed to be Carafa 3 special. But it has a lot of husk. I don't want roasted bitterness and acridicity in this brew. What should I do?</p>

<p>Today is the brew day and I needed to go with what I had. So I steeped 400g (grounded to about 200-300 microns) in cold water all night. Today I used 150 microns filtering bag and discarded solids. Resulting liquid is thick, black, opaque and hardly bitter. I was planning to add it at the end of mash, to convert leftovers, if any, and to filter it with the rest of my wort. But now, when I know there was husk in it, I doubt if it is the best plan. Should I rather pour it into filtering tun? Or add at the end of the boil? </p>

"Can big late hop addition hurt AIPA?","<p>I made two mistakes at the beginning of the boil, and I under-bittered my beer by 20 IBU. This is AIPA, so underbittering is serious mistake. Sadly, i only realized that by putting my notes back into Brewtarget at 15 minutes til the end of boil. I recovered using 35g Citra and 35g Mosaic at 10'. 26 liters ≈ 6.8 gallons batch. It got me bitterness I wanted (70 IBU in theory, and wort tastes just right). But my 20' addition was already there. I also still added 30g of Cascade at 0', for aroma. Didn't quite have a time to think it thorough, so, well... And I still plan to dry hop.</p>

<p>except I also added cranberries, a couple tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon. And yes, I used Fleischmann's rapid rise yeast. Today, after 2 weeks my airlock balloon deflated and I decided to bottle the hard cider. So, I combined everything that fermented with a little bit of water that I boiled and added a good amount of sugar to (so that the yeast hopefully feeds on it). I tasted it and it was mainly sour and odd tasting. No apple flavor and not sweet either. Is this normal? Why does this not taste that good? Can I fix this?</p>

"Unwanted yeast flavor last 2 brews (using starter)","<p>The last 3 all grain batches I've done have been using US-05 (IPAs) or 04 (porter) with yeast starters, which I'm relatively new to. Not sure what I'm doing wrong but the IPAs taste so similar despite very different malt/hop profiles-there is almost a Belgian, yeast flavor quality to them that overtakes the brightness that should be there in the style of IPAs I'm brewing. Before I started doing starters this characteristic never showed up. My porter (the 3rd brew in the aforementioned since utilizing starters) was spot on what I expected flavor wise, but I'm wondering if the malt bill there is such that it would overtake the yeasty taste no matter what. </p>

<p>I'm not sure what might be wrong in my process, as I try to be very careful with sanitization post boil/pre-ferment. Do I need to let the yeast separate 1/2 hour before pitching and get rid of the ""liquid-y part"" at the top and only pitch the ""cake""? Can anyone help?</p>

"Recover a brew that quit fermenting after I moved to secondary fermenter","<p>I started my first batch of beer, a ""Nut Brown Ale"", 2 weeks ago. Its initial gravity was 1.040. As per the instructions, I siphoned the beer into the secondary fermenter (a glass carboy) after two days. The airlock had already quit bubbling in the initial fermenter. Its gravity was 1.020 at that point. Today, 10 days after the move to the secondary fermenter, I tested the gravity and it was only at 1.018. The directions on the kit said it should be around 1.008-1.012 after 7 days. </p>

<p>It built and maintained positive pressure on the airlock the entire time since I moved it to 2nd fermenter, but I never actually saw bubbles. My room temperature is around 65F at night to 80F in the days. The beer tastes like ""beer"", but is kind of weak.</p>

"Will Adding an Active Mash to a Non-Active Mash Get Enzyme Activity Started Again?","<p>Background: A friend of mine does ten gallon batches of big beers, so has a lot of grain.  After mashing, his technique is to fly sparge with 170 degree water.  I understand this shuts-down enzymatic conversion.  He'll run out of sparge water, drain maybe 2/3 of the liquid from mash tun, and then lets me do whatever I want with the mash tun in order to make a second-run (partigyle) beer.</p>

<p>What I do during his sparging is to create a separate small mash with two pounds of two row, and get the enzymatic activity going well there.  Then, when the large mash tun becomes available, I adjust the temperature there to normal mashing temperature again (in the 150 F range), then mix in my small mash with the active enzymes (and enough appropriately heated water to mix in and come to rest at normal mashing temperature).</p>

<p>The Question: Will the enzymes in the small mash that are added to the large mash cause enzymatic activity in that grain that, earlier, had been ""too hot""?  I realize that the first large mash did most of the conversion.  This question is about what is left.  Will the enzymes in the small mash have a positive effect on the conversion of grains from the original mash?</p>

<p>Please only answer if you include references; we all likely have our ideas in the range of ""probably should"" or ""probably shouldn't"" get conversion going in the old grain, but I'm looking for something more definitive, a why it will or why it won't work, if at all possible.  Also, not interested in comments or suggested changes about the background...that's just the way it is, and what I have to deal with.</p>

<p>The temperature drops significantly over 60 minutes. For example, the test I just concluded with 5 gallons of water resulted in the following (Of course, opening the cooler to measure the temperature will change the outcome by some degree):</p>

<pre><code>Minutes | Temperature (F) | Change
  00    |     163         |   0
  15    |     158         |  -5
  30    |     153         |  -5
  45    |     153         |   0
  60    |     151         |  -2
</code></pre>

<p>Oddly, the temperature dropped 5 degrees in the first 15 minutes, another 5 in the second 15 minutes, didn't drop at all in the third 15 minutes, and dropped two in the final 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Test 2:</p>

<pre><code>Minutes | Temperature (F) | Change
  00    |     163         |   0
  15    |     160         |  -3
  30    |     160         |   0
  45    |     160         |   0
  60    |     169         |   9
</code></pre>

<p>Ok the brand new digital thermometer that I just bought today is obviously incorrect as the temperature spiked upwards 9 degrees. I'll have to repeat with a new thermometer.</p>

<p>There is a slight leak in the water cooler. I'll probably plaster the outside with silicon and test again tomorrow. However, I think I need to plan for a temperature reduction.</p>

<p>I've read that people typically add hot water to the mix if they are having trouble like I am having. How much should I add, at which temperature, and what time increments? Is this something that I'll just have to experiment with? </p>

<p>Should I just chock this up as a loss and buy a different cooler with a 1"" hole?</p>

"How much damage do aphids cause to hops?","<p>I have been growing hops by luck.  Last year I gave them a 3 pole teepee to climb and they flourished and were beautiful.  This year they were looking gorgeous once again, but days before I was about to pick them they became infested with aphids.  The explosion and destruction has been shocking.  My beautiful green cones are crawling with them and are suddenly turning brown (a separate problem?).  Some cones even have grey-black mold-looking stains I their bottom leaves.  HOWEVER, they still smell great and still have ample golden magic.  Question:  are my hops history or are they still worth picking.  My home brewing neighbor who has been a defender and supporter of my hops now turns up his nose.  How badly will the aphids effect my hops and our beer?</p>

<p>I was originally using them as primary as well, but being one that makes pretty high gravity beers, I was scared of the pressure build up inside even with a blow off tube, and what could potentially happen if the blow off tube got plugged up and too much pressure built up inside.  I am however unsure if having used them as primary before could have potentially weakened the container a from having held a lot of pressure at one point.</p>

<p>Anyway last week I had one filled up with 5 or so gallons and carried it down to my basement as my secondary.  And upon setting it on the ground (concrete ground, probably my first mistake), when it hit the ground the bottom shattered and beer went everywhere.  I've already fixed that mistake by making a padded area to place these on now when bringing them to the basement, but I'm pretty terrified of this ever happening again.</p>

<p>Is it possible using these as a primary weakened it to make this scenario more likely?  Are there other precautions I should be taking to make sure this never happens again?  Is this just a constant risk when using large glass containers?  Any other horror stories I should know about and strive to avoid?  I'm starting to think I shouldn't use glass anymore because I'm terrified this could happen again.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a definitive answer of whats actually happening during extended cold storage.  Is it just clarity?  Are you dropping polyphenols/tannins that affect FLAVOR?  Couldn't this be achieved with some finings and a quick crash?  I've had some pretty darned clear beers that I've turned around in less than 2 weeks, grain to glass with some prepared gelatin, big yeast pitch, and careful manipulation of fermentation temp.  </p>

<p>My only lager to date is Jamil's Oktoberfest that I primary'd @ 50* for 3 weeks, cold-pitched with about a gallon starter.  I have to be honest, I am a provisional BJCP judge, taking my tasting exam @ the end of the month, and consider myself to have a pretty good palette.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the sample of beer pulled @ 3 weeks, and the beer after it sat in a fridge for a month.  </p>

<p>Listening to Jamil and John Palmer talking about it, it sounds like the purpose is largely to achieve clarity.  I also seem to remember Jamil saying something to the effect of ""if you have a strong, healthy primary fermentation, you don't need to lager as much"".  </p>

<p>In many ways, it seems like decoction to me: an antequated process that is not really necessary anymore given upgrades in technology (in the case of decoction: advanced malting techniques; in the case of lagering: yeast selection/genetic modification, fermentation temp control, and refrigeration).  </p>

"Measuring temperatures at two points: weird trend?","<p>This seems like an ideal place to ask a question that has been keeping me confused for a little while now. But I apologize if I've posted in the wrong area.</p>

<p>My question is that I don't seem to understand the temperature trend that I am seeing from my temperature sensors. I'll start of with my setup: Essentially, I have a metal box with two temperature sensors.
1) Is mounted right at the base of the box [Temp Sensor #1]
2) The second temperature sensor is mounted 2 inches from the top of the box [Temp Sensor #2]. The box is about 6 inches in height.</p>

<p>I've placed a heating pad at the base of the box (Temp Sensor #1 lies right in the center of this pad. A graphic showing my setup:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TlIG3.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>I've also implemented a simple on/off temperature controller, that senses when the temperature goes above a certain set-point and turns off (hence you see the highs/lows for Temp Sensor #1). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdAoO.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>As you can see from the image, the lower sensor (blue) has the peaks/troughs corresponding to when the heater turns on/off. The heater gets triggered every time the sensing temperature goes below the set point. What I don't understand is why the top sensor (red) has a periodically decreasing trend (it doesn't have highs/lows similar to the bottom sensor)? It doesn't seem to be affected by the heater turning on at all? Even though it is merely 4"" away from the heater inside the metal enclosure. </p>

<p>I understand that Sensor#1 is probably changing immediately due to the heater very quickly affecting the metal base temperature via conduction. Whereas the second sensor is probably measuring the air around the metal enclosure at the top, and since air is an insulator, it takes longer to heat up. But there should be at-least some highs and lows I'd imagine. The continuous decreasing trend doesn't make any sense ...</p>

<p>Then, I suspected that perhaps my second temperature sensor was damaged. But that wasn't the case. I've tested both sensors and they work fine. Also here is a graph of the temperature trend, when I place the enclosure (with the sensors) in the freezer with no heater action. Intuitively as you can imagine, there is merely a decreasing trend for both sensors (shown below) due to the effect of the freezer:</p>

<p>Any suggestions please as to why I notice no temperature variation at Sensor #2 location when the heater turns on/off?</p>

"How can I ferment in a corny keg under constant pressure?","<p>I'm thinking about switching from fermenting (primary and secondary) in glass carboys to using Cornelius kegs. Specifically, I'd ferment a 5.5 gallon batch in a 10 gallon keg. </p>

<p>My goal is to ferment under pressure -- around 10 or 15 psi. Why? There's <a href=""http://www.professorbeer.com/articles/esters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">some</a> anecdotal <a href=""http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/EstFormAW0696.html"" rel=""nofollow"">evidence</a> that fermenting under pressure reduces ester production which could help with lager fermentation. But mostly, the pressure would a) let me remove yeast and trub after a few days of fermentation, and b) let me transfer the finished, carbonated beer to a serving keg under pressure</p>

<p>How can I regulate the pressure of fermenting beer in a Cornelius keg?</p>

<p>I can image a setup where the gas in line (with the tube removed, perhaps) is connected to a blow-off tube with an in-line pressure regulator. The regulator would need to be adjustable, so I could dial in different pressures for different beers, and at different stages in the fermentation.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if such an in-line regulator exists. I also expect it would need to be resilient to moisture. Fermenting 5.5 gallons in a 10 gallon vessel, there's not much chance that liquid will end up in the blow-off tube, but I want to be prepared for it if it does happen.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever put together a setup like this? Can anyone foresee technical difficulties I haven't thought of?</p>

Full disclosure: Not an electrician, mostly clueless.</p>

<p>Setting: Home Brewing Beer</p>

<p>Short: 120v DC variable drive motor running full tilt when 240v AC 5500w element is connected to mash tun.</p>

<p>Long: I have a 50 gallon brew kettle with a 240v 5500w AC heating element. The element has variable power supply. Recently I added a 120v DC variable speed motor to agitate the mash (stirring 50 gallons of mash by hand gets really old). The motor work appropriately when the heating element is not attached to a power supply; I can adjust the speed of the motor.</p>

<p>When the heating element is attached to its power supply, the agitator motor runs at full speed, and cannot be adjusted. I spoke with the manufacturer and they suggested that I have an electrician come out.</p>

<p>My house was built in the 20's and has lots of ""character"". Many of the circuits are not grounded. That being said, I am (fairly) certain the circuit that the agitator is running on is grounded, as well as the heating element.</p>

"Adding pecan flavor to brown ale","<p>I have a extract-based brown ale that needs about another 1-2 weeks in primary before I bottle it. I'd like to add some pecan flavor. </p>

"Starting gravity reading when not all fermentables are dissolved","<p><strong>Is it possible to get a useful starting gravity reading when not everything is dissolved or suspended, but you know it ultimately will be?</strong></p>

<p>Some context: In my pre-hydrometer days, I made a few cysers / honey ciders that really only amounted to apple juice, honey, and yeast.  I never was able to get the honey to fully dissolve, it just went straight to the bottom and sat there, silently mocking me.  After initially being concerned, I RDWHAHB'd, figuring the yeast would find the honey eventually.  And they did!  A couple weeks later, the honey layer was gone, leaving the beginnings of a delicious beverage behind.  </p>

<p>(In hindsight, I wonder if this accidental timed release mechanism meant the yeast weren't as stressed as they could have been, actually improving the final product.  But I digress.)</p>

<p>Back to my question: if I understand the physics of a hydrometer, it measures the buoyancy due to displacement of the water+stuff (dissolved/suspended).  So it seems to me that anything not dissolved or suspended (thus resting on the bottom) will NOT be reflected in the gravity reading, any more than if I were to throw in a handful of marbles.  Am I correct in my thinking here?</p>

<p>=== EDIT: anyone who comes this way, the following wasn't quite right, see answers below ===</p>

<p>If so, then it seems like it should be possible to calculate an ""effective"" OG, since I know how much adjunct I'm adding.  If:</p>

<pre><code>starting gravity = (density of wort)/(density of water)
                 = ((mass of wort)/volume)/((mass of water)/volume)
                 = (mass of wort)/(mass of water)  # since volume is equal
                 = (mass of water + mass of stuff)/(mass of water)
                 = 1 + (mass of stuff)/(mass of water)
</code></pre>

<p>then for the purpose of illustration and intentionally making the math easy, would adding 50g of honey to 1L of 1.050 AJ lead to an ""effective"" OG of 1.100?  (assuming 1L of water = 1000g)  </p>

"Diluting beer after 11 hours of fermentation. What to expect?","<p>Ended up with too high gravity wort. Since I was not prepared for this I didn't have enough sterile water to dilute the wort. I ended up pitching the yeast anyway and adding sterile water at 11 hours later. At this point the yeast was fully activated and regular air had probably left the tank. While being cautious about splashing, more oxygen most certainly ended up in the fermenter. In a about 15-20 minutes the airlock started letting air out again.</p>

Stainless steel is generally impervious to these levels of acidity, but the oxide layer with which aluminum alloys protect themselves from corrosion is attacked by any pH less than about 4 or over about 9.</p>

<p>Based on my findings I'm convinced that short-term contact is completely fine if not even beneficial but I'm curious about the effect of long-term contact of high citric acid concentrations against stainless steel.</p>

"How to prime and bottle?","<p>apologies for the somewhat newbie question (I can't hide it, this is my first batch and I'm hoping to get it right)!</p>

<p>I have started the Bulldog Evil Dog double IPA kit and although I am still some way off bottling, I would like to get all my queries answered before bottling. </p>

<p>My main lack of knowledge is in priming (I hope I'm using this term correctly) the instructions with the brewing kit suggest 1 carbonation drop or 1 teaspoon of sugar per 500 ml of product. </p>

<p>First of all are there any great differences in these two? </p>

<p>Second - if I were to use sugar, is this just your standard off the shelf granulated white sugar? </p>

<p>Third - should this be added in bulk to the entire batch before bottling and mixed thoroughly?</p>

<p>Fourth - if yes to above, should I then bottle straight away or should that be left to prime for a while longer in the fermenter? I believe the kit mentions this at the bottling stage but wanted to get others experiences!</p>

<p>Please note I don't have a secondary fermenter! </p>

<p>Once again apologies for the newbie questions! Just want to stay this right and tasting great.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!

"How long will a keg keep?","<p>We're brewing faster than we can drink. Right now I've got 3 kegs on tap, 1 (primed) keg sitting in the garage (very cold), and 9 carboys ready to be kegged. My question is this -- how long will a primed keg last? Could I keg a beer, purge O2, pressurize with CO2, put it in storage and then put it on tap in 3, 6 or 9 months? If so, should I keep the keg cold? Or does that not matter? Any advice would be great.</p>

"How do I predict final gravity?","<p>I've been taking the original gravity and multiplying the apparent attenuation of the yeast.  For instance:</p>

<p><code>1.040 OG x 75% apparent attenuation = 1.010 expected FG</code></p>

<p>But I never seem to get there. My fermentations look really healthy. Are my expectations realistic? Is this just hard to get right?</p>

<p>Here's a real world example:</p>

<p>I made a beer using this recipe:</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<ul>
<li>0.5 lb 40L Caramalt</li>
<li>3.3 lbs extra-light LME </li>
<li><p>1 lb extra-light DME</p></li>
<li><p>1 oz Fuggle @ 60 mins</p></li>
<li><p>1 oz Fuggle @ 1 min</p></li>
<li><p>0.5 Whirlfloc tab @ 10 mins</p></li>
<li>0.5 tsp Wyeast yeast nutrient @ 10 mins</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeast: Wyeast 1098 British Ale</p>

<p>OG: 1.038</p>

<p>Very short lag, healthy-looking initial fermentation with a clean white foam cap that fell back into the beer after three days.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>This yeast has an apparent attenuation range of 68-72%.  Thus, I would expect an FG of 1.010 to 1.012.</p>

<p>When I put it in bottles last night, it came in at 1.016.</p>

<p>I appear to be doing everything recommended.  For aeration, I'm pouring through a sieve, then sloshing for five minutes.  Maybe that's the missing link? Or are my expectations too high?</p>

<p>I pitched with two Wyeast packs of London ESB Ale as recommended by the LBS due to starting gravity. When I finished brewing, I realized that a hydrometer I had bought turned out to be a floating thermometer, so I could not take a first reading. I let it go as normal. Activity was normal for the first few days but never got really bubbling. I chalked this up as my first primary in a bucket vs. a carboy.</p>

<p>After 4 days, bubbling activity really slowed down. I considered adding more fermentables, but I had at least 5lbs of liquid malt extract plus my grains. I also find it hard to imagine that with two smack packs, the yeast didn't take off (I also aerated my wort before pitching and let the smack packs inflate for a few hours). </p>

<p>Today is day 8 and I picked up a hydrometer last night and took a reading. It is currently sitting at a gravity reading of 1.015, estimated at 2% ABV. My target is 5.5% ABV. Do I possibly have a stuck fermentation? What should I do, besides wait it out a few more days and take another reading?</p>

<p>EDIT: In my haste, I failed to check the temperature of my sample. My hydrometer is accurate at 60 degrees F. I will take a second sample and repost the new results.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 2nd reading at 60 was very close to the original. Maybe 1.018 for the gravity. I guess I can't figure out my ABV without an original reading but I can take another reading in a few days and see if it's still fermenting?</p>

"Open-Fermented or Native Yeast Beers","<p>I've always been very careful about control and sanitation with beer.  But with my wine I do some native yeast Pinots, and some friends of mine are into the same with beers-  they like funky, sometimes sour, open-fermented farmhouse ales &amp; Saisons or even some California knock-offs of the same.  Sometimes I think there's something there, other times I think they're nasty.</p>

<p>With wine, you have native yeast that's specific to the vineyard and lives on the skins of the grapes.  It's not all that risky because of the biology-- wine yeast thrives where there's food, and grapes provide it, generally.  But beer made in my garage is a different thing entirely.  I would think there's not much coming in on the grain hulls, and the wort boil kills whatever's there.  So I would think whatever native yeast I get is coming from... well.. my garage.  I'm not too into rat s#!t beer.</p>

<p>So how do you do a farmhouse-style ale at home without inoculating?  And can I just leave the airlock off my carboy and get a half-decent end result?</p>

"Why would OG be significantly higher than predicted?","<p>I know there are several questions on the forum about OG being lower than predicted.  Please bear with me though.  I'm at a loss.  I just brewed a straightforward extract wheat beer recipe.  The fermentables were:</p>

<ul>
<li>0.5 lb Crystal 60L, steeped in 0.5 gallons 150F water for 20 minutes, sparged (rinsed) with 0.5 gallons 150F water</li>
<li>5.5 lb Briess light DME</li>
<li>0.5 lb Briess wheat DME</li>
</ul>

<p>My recipe listed the OG as 1.051-1.053.  Beer Calculus puts it at 1.055.  My OG reading came in at 1.090.  That's really, really high.  What gives.  Here's what I can rule out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inaccurate hydrometer.  I tested it in 60F water and it reads 1.000.</li>
<li>Added too much DME.  I quadrouple checked.  I used a 5 lb sack of light DME from Austin Homebrew.  I measured another 0.5 lb, and measured out 0.5 lb of wheat DME.  I did not weigh the 5 lb sack to ensure it was 5 lbs.  The label does say 5 lb.</li>
<li>Final volume - I used 5.5 gallons of spring water today - 2.5 in the boil, 3 to top off the fermenter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible causes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hop debris.  I did not filter the wort when pouring it into the fermenter.  The sample I took for the OG had a lot of pellet hop debris in it.  Could this provide lift to the hydrometer?</li>
<li>Poorly mixed wort.  I poured the 2.5 gallons of cooled wort into the fermenter then added 3 gallons of bottled spring water.  Maybe it wasn't thoroughly mixed?</li>

"Forgot 1 piece to a 3 piece airlock, is this recoverable?","<p>Last weekend I brewed my first batch of beer.  I ordered the kit back in April because there was a Groupon and stuck the yeast in the fridge until I needed it.</p>

<p>Its been a week and I haven't seen any bubbling in the air lock, so I was thinking the yeast didn't make it.  However there is a lot of pressure in the fermenter because when I touch the lid I can feel that there is gas in there, and today I saw that the top was not fully locked in anymore.  So now I think that the air lock is just not working.</p>

<p>Is this a big problem or by putting the top on now everything will be ok?  I figured the water was there to prevent the wild yeasts and bacteria from getting in there.  Is that a safe assumption?</p>

"Controlling exothermic heat from primary fermentation with A/C cooling duct","<p>In terms of brewing with Ale yeasts, I understand that fermenter temps can increase up to 10 degrees, or more, than the ambient room temperature. As a ""cheap"" method for keeping the temperature of the fermenter as close as possible to the ambient temperature of the room, can I simply set the fermenter on a cooling duct? It would seem logical that the large surface area on the bottom of the fermenter would allow sufficient heat transfer to exchange at least <em>some</em> of the excess heat away from the fermenter.</p>

<p>Has anyone tried this before or can categorically state that this method is useless or shouldn't be attempted due to negative effects?

"What does high attentuation actually mean in terms of types of sugar fermented?","<p>So, when I fermented a cider it ended up very dry. I used champagne yeast and only added pure glucose. I then added lactic sugar since I knew that wasn't fermentable by the yeast I used.</p>

<p>I am confused however, by measurements of a yeasts ""attentuation"".

"Cherry vinegar (was supposed to be mead)","<p>Last week I started a cherry mead and discovered yesterday that it had turned to vinegar (and not even nice-tasting cherry-flavoured vinegar - it smelled and tasted awful, though the colour was great). I'm not sure how this happened, so I'm posting what I did in the hopes that someone can diagnose the problem before I try again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Boil 4 litres (I make mead in a 5L jar on my kitchen counter - my apartment is not big enough for rows of carboys!) of water for 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Reduce heat to below boiling and add 1 kg (about 1L) of honey (plain, Billy Bee honey).</li>
<li>Remove scum from surface until no more scum forms.</li>
<li>Add 500 ml of washed, diced, pitted black cherries (tied up in a cheesecloth) to the water and honey</li>
<li>Add 750 ml of black cherry juice (bought at a nearby health-food store), because I didn't have very many cherries left.</li>
<li>Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Cool, add to fermentation jar, pitch yeast (Lalvin champagne yeast).</li>
</ol>

<p>An observation: this batch fermented far faster and far more vigorously and violently than any other batch! Almost all of the sugar was consumed by fermentation within 4 days. In all my other batches, it typically took 8 to 12 days for this much sugar to be consumed.</p>

<p>I have used this variants of this process (minus the fruit), steps 1 - 3 and 7 for almost a dozen batches (all successful so far) over the past two years, so I'm thinking the problem was in the fruit.</p>

<p>This was actually my second fruit mead - the first one was with strawberries, and they were thrown in at the <em>beginning</em> of the process (Step 1, when boiling the water), I thought it would be important to sterilize them. I later read that fruit should <em>not</em> be boiled, or pectin would form and result in a very cloudy mead (and yes, the strawberry mead was tasty but also cloudy), and also possibly affect the flavour.</p>

<p>So I've been wondering about where the failure was:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cherries - Should they have been boiled, or sterilized in some other way? I have also read recipes that involve putting the cherries in <em>during</em> fermentation but to me that seems to carry an even greater risk of infection from outside sources. 
<ul>
<li>Would I have better luck with frozen cherries (or other fruit), assuming that the frozen fruit is somehow sterilized before it's frozen?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The cherry juice - It was supposed to have been pasteurized, but I admit I opened it a little before I made the mead, just to taste it.</li>
<li>Bad luck??</li>
<li>Something else in this process that I missed?</li>
</ul>

<p>It was also suggested to me by a friend that cinnamon has antibacterial properties so I should put 1 or 2 sticks in when boiling the water (they also said the juice of one lime would work as well, but I'm not sure about that and I worry it would have a strong impact on the flavour).</p>

If I split up my 5 gal of beer into 5 of these jugs, I should be able to let it hang out in there for a few weeks before I bottle. These are clear glass bottles, but they would be stored in a dark crawl space, so I shouldn't have to worry about skunking.</p>

<p>Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Is there some problem I might encounter by having the beer in multiple locations (e.g. oxidation)? Or could there be a problem with the screw-top lid? </p>

<p>In my case, I had purchased the yeast just the day prior to brewing, and LHBS had received it that same day. The wort was very well aerated, which I understand should help give me healthy yeast. With that information, is it going to be necessary to take measures to drop the yeast out? If so, how should I deal with it? Some sort of finings such as gelatin? Cold-crash?

<p>As mentioned in <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/5007/clarification-for-a-low-flocculating-yeast"">this question</a>, I'm anticipating some trouble with a low-flocculating yeast, and one of the suggestions was to use gelatin for fining in the secondary.</p>

<p>I am planning to bottle-condition these beers, and my understanding is that while for bottle conditioning one hopes for about 1,000,000 cells per mL, that finings such as gelatin and isinglass have the ability to bring me down to about 10,000 cells per mL.  One additional piece of information is that this is <a href=""http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=144"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a low-flocculating Kolsch yeast</a>, so I wonder if the effect will be as significant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm making an oatmeal stout for Jaime Paglia, and I'm trying to figure out the best time to put in the oats. This will be a partial mash, using extract for the base and some steeped specialty grains.</p>
  
  <p>I can't find consensus on the usual forums. Some brewers say to put the oats (about 1 pound for a 5 gallon batch) in with the steeping grains. Others say you have to mash the grains with some 2 row, but don't say how much 2 row you should use, and how to scale back the extract if you go that way. I'm not afraid to do that kind of mashing (yay! experience!), but it's easier to use extract, so that's my preference at this point in my evolution as a brewer.</p>
  
  <p>So I was thinking that I'd use the basic stout recipe I have, and I'd toast a pound of quick oats in the oven first, then steep them with the specialty grains when they were all toasty and golden and good.</p>
  
  <p>I'm very interested to hear opinions on this, and I thank you all in advance for sharing whatever experience you've had.</p>

"Possibly infected mead: is it worth keeping?","<p>I tried making cherry mead again (the first time I tried this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/4989/cherry-vinegar-was-supposed-to-be-mead"">it got infected</a>). I tried again yesterday, and it looks like I've got some sort of contamination (""infection"").</p>

<p>This time I thought that everything was OK, at first. The foam that I usually see from yeast fermentation appeared within 30 minutes of pitching the yeast, but when I got home tonight, it was the much more vigorous bubbling that I saw along the surface. Specific gravity went from 1.076 to 1.028 in a little more than 24 hours. The taste is a bit off - not as bad as last time, but not as good as it should be. </p>

<p>Things I did differently from last time: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>No</em> fresh cherries, just pasteurized cherry juice.</li>
<li>The juice bottle was only opened moments before adding it to the must.</li>
<li>Added two cinnamon sticks with the cherry juice (for <em>supposed</em> antibacterial properties)</li>
<li>I brought everything up to the boiling point for a few minutes before letting it cool and pitching the yeast.</li>
<li>Sealed a plastic bag over the top of the fermentation jar (to keep out fruit flies).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second time it's happened... I'm guessing now that it's either the cherry juice itself (supposed to be pasteurized, but who knows), the equipment (it's all glass and stainless steel, but one food-safe plastic piece - maybe that one needs to go?), something in the air?, ...maybe the yeast is bad?</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to throw a few campden tablets in there and then put it in the fridge to chill. Does anything think this can be saved? I know I'd have to re-pasteurize it and add more honey or sugar - or is infected must not even salvageable?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I saw that it was still <em>slightly</em> bubbling in the fridge this morning. That's after I put in 3 campden tablets (The guy at the wine store said 2 is usually enough for under 5 litres) and left it in the fridge overnight. It's either very hardy yeast or a very hardy infection. I'm not going to give up hope yet, I'll test it again when I get home tonight.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Second Update:</strong></p>

<p>Just tested it again. Specific Gravity is only down to 1.026 so not much fermentation has happened in the last 24 hours, I guess the bubbling this morning (and even this evening) was just gas that was already there being released. The surface is still clear (save for small clusters of bubbles) and the taste is not as bad as yesterday. The smell is like sour cherries though (and I used sweet black cherry juice!). </p>

<hr>

<p>So guess I most of the panic was due to my inexperience with fruit meads, and not knowing what to expect. I'm guessing the cherry juice was a <em>very</em> good yeast nutrient - I'm used to pitching dry yeast without adding nutrients or energizers, so I guess I was just surprised by the vigorous and intense reaction I got here, as well as the sudden and strange change in taste and smell.</p>

<hr>

<p>2012-01-13</p>

<p>So I finally had one of these bottles yesterday. It was nice but the cherry flavour was very mild, much more so that I thought it would. Next time, I think I will use at least 50-50 blend of sour cherry and black cherry juices (or all sour cherry), and use much more juice and much less water. </p>

"Fruit Beer: When to rack to secondary?","<p>Right now, I'm working on a peach wheat beer. I pitched about 5 days ago now, and the airlock stopped bubbling yesterday. I'm going to do a gravity reading later on today to see if it's finished. My current plan is to rack the beer onto the peaches in secondary, which I've seen recommended in several places. My question is, <strong>how long should I wait between primary fermentation finishing and racking onto the fruit?</strong> I know right now the yeast should be cleaning up after its self in the primary, and if I wasn't going to be adding more sugar (in the form of fruit) in, I'd definitely leave it alone for a while. But, since its about to go ferment again, should I give it time, or can it do clean up once it's done fermenting the peaches?</p>

Is it primarily by color, viscosity, foam or some combination of all of them?</p>

"Fruit mead - VERY vigorous fermentation","<p>I have made several batches of meads, using different yeasts, with the same recipe.

These are one-gallon batches.</p>

<p>The carboys ended up pretty full, and I couldn't add the whole yeast mixture.  This worried me, as I wasn't sure if I would get enough fermentation.</p>

<p>However, my carboys keep popping the lids on the airlocks, and fermentation has been frighteningly fast.  I have poured out a small amount of each batch to make some more airspace in the bottles, and it just filled up with foam again.  I have fruity foam erupting out through the airlocks, more so in one batch than the other, and I keep removing them to clean and replace.  It's only 3 days into what usually is a 2-week fermentation process, and they have finally slowed down (to a stop, I think, which doesn't seem right), and I'm not sure if something went horribly wrong, or if this is normal for a fruit mead.</p>

"Flat beer with table sugar?","<p>I brewed this <a href=""https://beerbrew.com/downloads/Recipes/Oktoberfest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Ale Oktoberfest</a> beer and I thought everything went perfectly, but the bottles are flat (have tried 4 of them)</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 weeks in the primary</li>
<li>1 week in secondary (5 gal carboy)</li>
<li>FG of 1.012</li>
<li>Priming solution: boiled &amp; cooled solution of 5 oz. table sugar, mixed well into bottling bucket.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottles have sat for 3 weeks.  They started out at over 70 but lately it has been cooler and they have been around 65 degrees.</p>

<p>I asked my homebrew shop and they said the problem is likely that I used table sugar instead of corn sugar.  They said that disaccharides are harder to break down than straight glucose and maybe the yeast just couldn't do it.</p>

<p>However, looking online it seems lots of people use table sugar.  This is my second batch, for my first batch I also used table sugar and it had perfect carbonation.</p>

<p>Here are all the possible problems that I can imagine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Too much yeast dropped out after secondary fermentation, so not enough was left in suspension to carbonate? (counterpoint: 3 weeks is not very long, if anything it's on the shorter side)</li>
<li>Maybe they indeed had trouble with the disaccharide sugar (or maybe combination of 1 and 2)</li>
<li>During my first batch I used vegan sugar from Whole Foods, my second batch I used Domino sugar</li>
<li>I pitched the yeast a little warm (80-85 degrees).  But the bottles have mostly been conditioning around 65.  Maybe fermentation encouraged the growth of more yeast that preferred the warmer temp, and they don't like the cooler bottling temp.</li>
</ol>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring bottles up to 70 degrees, wait longer</li>
<li>Pour everything into bottling bucket, add CBC yeast and 5 oz. corn sugar solution, rebottle.  (Problem with this: if the initial priming sugar was never fermented, would this create bottle bombs once healthy yeast is re-introduced?  Would the priming sugar cause a measurable change in gravity, so that I could measure whether it fermented?)</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other advice or thoughts?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I have a few more data points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried more bottles: some have a tiny amount of fizz, others practically flat.</li>
<li>Immediately after bottling, 4 bottles went down to Virginia.  When they were opened, they were all carbonated, with a head even.</li>
</ul>

<p>I performed the following experiment:</p>

<ul>
<li>I opened two 22 oz. bottles and added 1/4 tsp CBC yeast rehydrated in 1 1/2 tsp water</li>
<li>To one of these bottles I also added a solution of 3/4 tsp corn sugar </li>
</ul>

<p>One week later, both were carbonated.  The one with sugar more than the other, and <em>maybe</em> a tad overcarbonated but not by much.</p>

<p>I plan to add the same amount of yeast and 1/2 tsp corn sugar to the remaining bottles.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your help and suggestions.  I'm not sure if there is one answer I can accept but I will read through them again and see.</p>

<h2>Update #2</h2>

<p>Here I was ready to add a yeast / sugar solution to each bottle.  It has now been 7 weeks in the bottle and I last tried one maybe 2 weeks ago and was still pretty much flat.</p>

I don't recall the specific brand, but it was a 'Newkie Brown' kit that came in a tin and was like black treacle to start with (e.g. a syrup not a powder or something, not sure what other types are to start with...)</p>

<p>I followed the instructions pretty accurately. I made up 23 litres of the liquid and left it for 6 days in the bucket (as per the instructions). The instructions said it should be kept at between 18 and 20 degrees (centigrade) - the only space I had big enough was the boiler cupboard and the temp unfortunately hovered around 22 degrees. I used brewers sugar in the first stage.</p>

<p>The next stage was to bottle the beer and leave at room temp for 2 weeks. I bottled up 48 bottles and have them in a kitchen cupboard - should be pretty room temp-ish. I used regular granulated sugar in this stage.</p>

<p>As I say, I followed the instructions to what I consider pretty well (other than the temp, which was only a few degrees out), but today, after leaving them for two weeks in the bottle as described, the beer is extremely fizzy, i.e. when I open a bottle a great big jet of it sprays out (like opening Champagne). It's not super fizzy when drinking it, although I can see a small stream of bubbles rising from one spot at the bottom.</p>

<p>Secondly, the beer is not clear and the instructions said it was ready when it was clear. Also, it's not just a bit cloudy, it's entirely opaque.</p>

<p>It tastes OK - no weird twangs or bad aftertaste or anything. All of the equipment - bucket, siphoning kit, bottles, stirrer, etc, were all thoroughly sterilized.</p>

<p>Does it need more time and then it will clear? Did I do something badly wrong and it will never clear? Could the increased first stage temp be the cause? Are the kits a waste of time?</p>

<ul>
<li>If I just made the sterilizer came in to contact with all of the bottle could I just leave it for 10 minutes before rinsing?  This is similar to what the instructions say for cleaning the fermentation bucket.</li>
<li>Is putting the bottles in the oven as effective as using a sterilizer?</li>
<li>I'll be sterilizing my bottling bucket at the same time, can I put a load of bottles in there at the same time?</li>

"Tea-like aroma in my beer","<p>Last week, I decided to make a simple pale ale. I wanted something fairly light, not too bitter, and with a hint of caramel. I had some CTZ and Simcoe hops in the freezer so I wanted to use those in this brew. I am not an expert by any means, but below is what I came up with. Notice that all the hops were added with 20 minutes or less. The aroma addition was at flameout with a 15-minute hop stand before chilling. I intended to use pale malt but at the last moment decided to use pale ale malt instead, which I've never used before.</p>

<p>After the boil, while racking from the kettle to the fermenter, I noticed an aroma of Southern sweet tea. I had hoped that would go away, but when I took a hydrometer sample last night it was still there in a big way. I also get very little of what one would expect from the Simcoe hops. There is also not enough bitterness, likely owing to the fact that the CTZ I used were only 12.9% AA instead of the 15.5% value Brewtarget uses by default.</p>

<p>So my questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>What could have caused this tea aroma? Is more likely the hops or the pale ale malt?</li>
<li>Is this something that is likely to fade over time?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I kegged and served this beer last night, and it turned out pretty good. More caramel flavor than I expected but not over the top. I definitely get an earthy flavor from the late CTZ hops. But the more relevant point is that the tea aroma has gone away.</p>

<p>I brewed a porter this past weekend that had neither Simcoe nor CTZ in it, and I caught a faint whiff of that aroma again as I moved it to the fermenter. It dawned on me then that I started smelling this when I switched from Irish moss to Whirlfloc (5 minutes). Every batch in which I've used Whirlfloc has had that aroma when it went into the fermenter. Thankfully, it does go away after a couple of weeks in the fermenter and does not affect the beer.</p>

<p>So I suspect it's the Whirlfloc. I've read complaints of a ""fishy"" or ""oceany"" smell when people overuse the stuff, but never ""tea"" like I experience. I guess that could come down to my sniffer just being a little different. This will not deter me from using Whirlfloc, though. That stuff is way better than the Irish moss I was using.</p>

"Making Hard Cider in a Dorm","<p>So I am attempting to make my own hard cider. At my school, there is a farmers market every Thursday and at this market they sell flash pasteurized cider; the process is stopped partway through so it is clean to drink but can still ferment. Anyways I have tried (with success at about a gallon per batch) to create hard cider simply by pouring the cider into bottles, stopping the bottles with cotton balls, and leaving them in a dark corner for 4 days. In that time they fermented (smelled like yeast and alcohol so at least I think they did) so I filtered them, mixed them into a big pot, brought the mixture to 160-180 degrees, and then chilled them. </p>

<p>During the last batch, one bottle had a dry white collection (looked almost like baking soda) resting above the bubbles. I mixed it with the batch anyways; is that safe? Should I toss out the batch? I drank it last night and feel fine, but what do you think it was?</p>

<p>Also the past two batches have tasted great but tend to be very very weak, bringing me to another question: if I add yeast, say champagne yeast, before I let them sit, will this increase my alcohol yield? Also, should I add sugar with the yeast? The concoction is still very sweet with the above mentioned method.</p>

"Apple cider fermentation stuck for 20+ days","<p>I am on my second year producing apple cider at home, and was successful producing 40 liters of apple cider and perry last year, and are through primary fermenting about 40 liters this season. But my last batch of 20 liters, which I set in a bucket 17th September, is stuck still (>20 days). What can I do now? Best course of action?</p>

<p>additives: Pectolase, nutrition salts, 2 table spoons campden powder all added 2 days earlier</p>

<p>temperature: between 20-25 C across 20 days</p>

<p>Specific gravity: Measured 1.050 at 17th September, 1.045 on 9th October.
The liquid is very clear, with just very little foam on top, no bubbles or pressure on the air lock. There is no bad smell, a slight smell of yeast.</p>

<p>UPDATE OCT 16TH: The mystery continues. I followed the advice given here, mail ordered for more Lalvin yeast EC-1118, rehydrated and added to bucket on Oct 13th. Now it is Oct 16th, there is no pressure on the air lock, about 20 C, clear liquid, still SG 1.045. pH was estimated with indicator film to between 4 and 5. The new rehydrated yeast also bubbled, I don't think that's the problem. What is wrong? Could there be something toxic to the yeast in the batch? The only substances that comes to mind are traces of Saniclean (phosphoric acid) and dishwashing liquid, but I don't think so. Alternative hypotheses? Should I give up?</p>

"How to calculate the minimum vessel sizes for all grain brewing","<h2>Background:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brewing in an kitchenette with limited storage space</li>
<li>All Grain brewing, extracts are not available around here</li>
<li>I'm looking at BIAB also, but want to have the traditional 3 vessels setup</li>

</ul>

<p>I want to get 20l batches (on the primary fermentor) of regular strength beers ( OG &lt; 1060 ).</p>

<li>Water to grain ratio of 4l / kg</li>
<li>90 minute boils</li>
<li>Fly sparging or batch sparging</li>

<p>This is where I got so far:</p>

<h2>Mash tun</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 liters of deadspace (assuming I make it so)</li>
<li>20l Strike water</li>
<li>Grain absorption of 8.3l (1.67l/kg got that number somewhere in the web)</li>
<li>With our sparge method we have always a max of 20l of liquid on the pot </li>
</ul>

<p><strike>
--> First issue, how do I estimate the volume taken by the grains?
</strike></p>

<p>Edit: Beersmith estimates it to be 0.652 l/kg, so: </p>

<ul>
<li>Volume of grains = 5 * 0.652 = 3.26 l</li>
</ul>

<p>Mash tun minimum size: <strong>23.3 l</strong></p>

<h2>Boil Kettle</h2>

<ul>
<li>Deadspace 5l (assuming)</li>
<li>Post boil volume 25l (20l for fermentor + 5l deadspace)</li>
<li>Evaporation = 25l * 9%/h * 1.5h = 3.37l (this should really be from <strong>pre-boil</strong> volume, but don't know how to get that) </li>
<li>liquid expansion ( 25l + 3.37 ) * 4% = 1.13l  same as above</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil kettle minimum size: 25l + 3.37l + 1.13l = <strong>29.5l</strong> </p>

<p>Plus some slack to prevent boil overs.. </p>

<p><em><strong>How do I</strong> calculate pre-boil volume?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>How much</strong> is the minimum extra space to avoid boilovers?</em></p>

<h2>HTL</h2>

<ul>
<li>No deadspace</li>
<li>In the Boil kettle we will have at least 25l + 3.3 = 28.5l of pre-boil volume</li>
<li>From the mash we get 18l - 8.3l = 9.7l for first runnings</li>
</ul>

<p>HLT minimum size: 28.5l - 9.7l = <strong>18.8l</strong></p>

<p>That would give me nicely stackable pots of a very manageable size, where not for the issues above...</p>

<h2>BIAB</h2>

<ul>
<li>mash volume = pre-boil + absorption + grain volume = 28.5 + 8.3 + 3.26 = <strong>40 l</strong></li>

"How to Cold Crash an Imperial Stout?","<p>During my first all-grain (an Imperial Stout recipe a friend and I invented), I managed to forget adding Irish Moss towards the end of the boil. After 3 weeks in primary, I've verified that fermentation has finished through consecutive days of gravity readings and I'm trying to decide what to do next. OG: 1.080, FG: 1.012, and the recipe I have written down somewhere if it's needed with regards to my questions.</p>

<p>After reading around lots of books, forums, and wikis, it seems no one agrees on cold-crashing, so I'd like to ask some more-specific questions.</p>

<p>I've read that cold-crashing will clear up your beer by causing yeast and other solids to settle to the bottom. Some have argued that this is an unnecessary step for a stout, but I'd like to put in the effort to minimize bottle trub and cloudiness after in-bottle conditioning. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Can I cold-crash with the beer still in the primary fermenter bucket before transfering to secondary?</strong> (My thoughts being that I can siphon from the bucket into the secondary carboy without moving it from the fridge and agitating the beer)</li>
<li>If so, <strong>for how long and at what temperature should I cold-crash this imperial stout ale?</strong> The yeast used was Wyeast 1056 (American Ale).</li>
<li><strong>My fridge has other food in it, too.</strong> I know there will be a suck-in effect created from the pressure differential that arises when cooling a sealed container to match a new environment's temperature, and I realize this could cause the bucket to 'suck in' potential contaminants or flavor-affecting aromas from whatever else is in the fridge. <strong>Is this a deal-breaker for cold-crashing?</strong></li>
<li>I plan to dry-hop for a week as another experiment right before bottling. <strong>Is there a problem with racking to secondary AFTER cold-crashing my primary bucket, raising the temperature back to 68F, then adding my sanitized and weighted hop bag?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will this process have a substantial effect on carbonation?</strong> If so, should I pitch more yeast or increase the amount of priming sugar I use before bottling? I do plan on aging this beer for a long time in the bottles, so if cold-crashing will just cause the beer to take longer to carbonate, that is not a problem.</li>

<ol>
<li>I connected <a href=""http://www.beveragefactory.com/draftbeer/regulator/double/premium_double_gauge_542.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this regulator</a> to a 5 lb. CO2 cylinder. </li>
<li>Closed the blue output valve.</li>
<li>Turned the regulator knob all the way down (left, i.e. counter-clockwise, i.e. out, i.e. towards the minus sign).</li>
<li>Opened the valve on the CO2 cylinder.</li>
<li>As expected, at this point the input (high-pressure) guage quickly goes up to about 600 psi. </li>
<li>NOT expected: the output (low-pressure) guage quickly goes up to 50-60 PSI (the upper limit), and the relief valve starts sputtering and releasing CO2 quickly.</li>
<li>Finally, as expected, when I shut off the cylinder, the input pressure slowly drops to zero (and then, if I hold open the relief valve or open the output, so does the output pressure.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I can't find any configuration of knobs and valves that doesn't result in the output pressure spiking and the relief valve opening. Am I missing something? Is the regulator broken? Something else entirely?</p>

<p>NOTE: If I open the output, and open the regulator a little bit (so it's just releasing CO2 into the room) then the regulator knob does control the flow rate, as expected. Turning the knob to the left reduces the flow to a fairly low rate. If I then block the flow by closing the output valve, the output pressure builds to 60 PSI in about a second and the relief valve opens.</p>

"Bottling a Lager","<p>I brewed my first lager (a doppelbock) about a month ago and I'm thinking about bottling it in about a week.

"when making whiskey (or beer) what is left of the barley?","<p>[Mod: distilling is normally off-topic here, however, this question could equally be about making beer, since the primary subject is mashing/sparging and spent grain, so I'm keeping this question open so long it doesn't touch on distilling.]</p>

This water contains enzymes etc from the barley, and this water only content is fermented, and so on in the process.</p>

<p>While Im sure this is hardly accurate it may be a general approximation in layman terms.  If there are fundamental errors of understanding, please correct me.  But Im understanding that the actual barley kernals are separated from the mix before fermentation.</p>

<p>Does this leftover waste have a term I can look up to find more about?</p>

I am not looking for things to do with this waste.</p>

"Why is the beer head and head retention important?","<p>Does the head improve something on the beer flavour/aroma?</p>

<p>Back home in Brasil, the folk has it that head is useful to keep the beer cold, but in colder lands (and warmer beers) as they have in Europe that is probably a non-issue.</p>

<p>In fact, some fast drinkers over there would argue for smaller head to get more beer.</p>

<p>Why head and head retention are important?</p>

"Too late to move a brew?","<p>I brewed an IPA yesterday. All went well and it is bubbling away today. However, my friend's brewing fridge/fermenting chamber just freed up and he suggested putting my brew in there. It would obviously be better to ferment it in the fridge with temp control etc. I'd have to drive it to his house (5 mins away). Is it too late to move it? Will that just oxidise the beer? Or is it early enough that I won't have to worry about that yet? </p>

"How early can I know if a brew is ruined?","<p>Today I tried my very first brew using a <a href=""https://store.coopers.com.au/shop/product/DBK676/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coopers DIY kit</a>. I was told the <a href=""https://store.coopers.com.au/shop/product/DBK918/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lager mix</a> that comes with the kit probably won't taste amazing, but it should be hardy and forgiving for beginners that don't have a temperature controlled fridge yet.</p>

<p>The instructions recommend making sure the water temperature is between 21-27 degrees celcius before adding yeast. But it also said to add the yeast ASAP after mixing. So, stupidly, I didn't do a wet run and didn't have any (properly) cold water and as a result <strong>my mix was at 36 degrees when I added the yeast!</strong> Even now, an hour later I think it's at about 34 degrees.</p>

<p>So, instead of bottling in a few days then waiting a month to find out if it's ruined, I was considering scrapping this batch and trying again (with a wet run first to get the temperature right this time). So my question is: <strong>will tasting it in a few days be sufficient to tell if I need to start again?</strong> How exactly will I know?</p>

<p>My Original Gravity measured at 38, but I don't know if that's relevant.</p>

"Why is there so much foam when I open the bottle?","<p>I have a batch of beer, fermented and then bottled. When I open the bottle, there is a lot of foam and it flows out of the bottle for a while.</p>

<p>What could cause this? I assume it's too much CO2 and thus too much priming sugar? (This is a 5 Gallon Batch, mixed with Water/Sugar in a bottling bucket, so no Fizz Drops)</p>

<p>Should I leave the bottles alone for another week or two? Could temperature cause it? (Temperatature varied between 68 and 76 degrees F during the entire process)</p>

<li>Cooled the Wort in a Water Bath. I didn't have a Wort Chiller at the time and it was hard to get the Water cold enough, so that process easily took 45 minutes. Original Gravity was lower than expected (I think 1047 instead of 1062), Final Gravity was 1011.</li>
<li>Put it in a 5 Gallon Fermenting Bucket and let it sit there (I don't have a secondary fermentor, although I'm about to order one)</li>
<li>Let it sit in my closet, temperatures between low 60's and mid-70's (my AC can only set to either heat or cool, so controlling the temperature is an issue)</li>
<li>Bottled on 2/21 with the provided 5oz of priming sugar</li>
<li>Opened a bottle on 2/27 => Beer was foamy, a little foam rose and escaped, beer tastes a bit flat</li>

<li>Took too long to chill</li>
<li>Only one fermentor</li>
<li>Lack of good temperature control</li>
<li>Opened too early after bottling</li>

"Yeast Starter Stopped after ~20 hours","<p>I am trying to make skeeter pee without the slurry from a previous batch. so I wanted to make a starter to make sure my yeast were happy guys.</p>

<p>I took 3 pints of water to 1 teaspoon of yeast nutrients and about 6 teaspoons sugar. and a packet of ec-1118 yeast. I let that go for about 8-10 hours and it was happily bubbling the airlock. When I started the starter I had also put together the primary. The starter had an SG of about 1.09 and about 22% sugar. not too far off the 1.07 he recommends on the site. So that had been sitting for the same 8-10 hours. Before I went to bed, I degassed the primary for a few seconds, and then I added about a pint of primary to the starter and waited, within an hour it had bubbled up again through the airlock. and the yeast was churning and swimming around and doing its yeasty thing.</p>

<p>Now, this morning I woke up and in my excitement ran to see how my starter was doing. To my dismay, there was no activity in the bottle. Is this a stuck fermentation? I cant imagine the yeast ate all the sugar in there already. Not sure what my next step should be. Add more sugar and yeast energizer? Or wait another little bit?
Is there anything I did wrong?</p>

"Hydrometer reading interference","<p>When brewing an IPA about a week ago, my starting gravity reading came out to be 1.12 - significantly higher than the listed target of 1.07 on the recipe.

<p>Here's what I believe happened - I noticed after taking the first sample that it contained some sediment that had failed to settle out. Being relatively new to this, I didn't think much of it at the time but now I imagine this contributed to an artificially high initial reading. Can anyone confirm this?</p>

So far the taste of it was yummy, bitter, a little fruity and the finish just sucks your tongue dry.</p>

<p>Now after four weeks I got curious to see what it turned out like so far so I took a tasting glass and emptied a bit of beer from the carboy using the spigot on the bottom. There was a fair bit of sediment in the glass (I think most of it is hop pellet remains):

<p>Are there any other options aside from putting it to secondary? (if you guys think this is too much sediment I guess I don't have any other option) </p>

"Degassing and it's effects on yeast","<p>I'm wondering if degassing and removing the suspended CO2 (a part of, and a percentage of the wine) changes the totals for ABV% as it applies to yeast tolerance.

Even if 1% of the mead/wine is CO2, and it's released through degassing, that would mean the ABV would increase.</p>

<p>On the flip side, by removing one of the two toxins(ethel alcohol &amp; CO2)from the yeast, does this give them more room and less stress to ferment further? Since CO2 is toxic to yeast, does it inhibit the yeast's ability to fully ferment the larger amount of sugars in wine/mead?</p>

<p>Despite keeping the amount of grain the same I didn’t end up with wort concentrated enough to get near my 20 litres target.</p>

<p>Was it ever possible meet the 20 litre volume with my 12 litre pot?</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can’t work out where I went wrong.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

<p>UPDATE: As requested, this update gives the recipe used, which is the Munich Helles from James Morton's book, BREW. However in terms of method I didn't follow the books Lager Method in terms of water quantities as I decided to use a 12 litre pot for mash/boil and use the liquor back approach which is discussed in the book albeit in an on/off manner throughout the book. (FYI The book suggests it's possible with a 10 litre pot, but its never discussed wrt to a specific recipe)... (i'd recommend the book though).</p>

<p><strong>TARGET NUMBERS</strong>, <br> OG 1.046-1.048 <br> FINAL GRAVITY 1.011-1.013 <br> ABV: 4.5% - 4.7% <br> <br>
<strong>BATCH SIZE</strong> <br> 20 Litres <br>
Estimated Efficiency 70%</p>

<p><strong>GRAIN BILL</strong> <br>
Pilsner Malt, German 4.3kg (9.5lb) <br>
(I asked for the grain to be crushed, the MaltMiller.co.uk did this for me) <br><br>
<strong>HOPS:</strong> <br>
First wort hop: Hallertauer (4% AA) 40g (1.5 oz) <br>
Aroma Steep: Hallertauer (4% AA) 60g (2.125 oz) <br><br>
<strong>YEAST:</strong> GERMAN LAGER YEAST: WLP830 <br><br>
1 IRISH MOSS TABLET (I used Protofloc)</p>

<p><strong>The Method</strong> <br> 
Prepare a starter a week before in 2 phases from 2 pure yeast sachets, based on a yeast calculators estimate of my required cell count. </p>

<p><strong>MASH IN</strong>
I insulated the 12 litre pot with 4 layers of large bubble wrap and string and lined it with the grain bag. I filled it the with 9 litres at 69.5°C , as 2:1 ratio is quoted as a minimum, and poured in the 4.3kg grain, and pushed the grain down with a plastic paddle so the water covered it. I then stirred a little so that there were no obvious clumps of dry grain. The water temperature dropped to 50°C (ish), although it was impossible to get a confident reading, as it was so thick. I then added just boiled water in 500 ml increments until i was getting my target 65°C and started a 1 hour timer and put the glass lid on. I checked this approximately 15 min intervals and it appeared to approximately hold the temperature for the whole hour (again it was hard to know if the reading was representative of all the pot.) i believe there was about 11 litres of water in the pot, at this point.</p>

<p><strong>MASH OUT</strong>
I attempted to raise the grain temperature, initially on maximum heat (gas), to 75°C but i had a differential of about 15C between the edge of the pot at (85C) and the centre of the grain at (70°C), I kept trying to stir the grain but to no real avail over 15 mins. I effectively gave up and moved onto the sparge.</p>

<p><strong>SPARGE</strong>
I pulled out the grain into a massive caterers mixing bowl and poured over 2 litres of water at 75°C, and let it rest for 10 mins. The grain was sat in the water as all the grain and the 2 litres of water fit in the bowl. <strong>In hindsight - Perhaps the bowl should have been intentionally small so that water in the grain bag would drip into the bowl rather than soak into the grain more?</strong>
After the 10 mins was up, i gently squeezed the grain bag and I poured the water from the bowl into the pot with the wort and dumped the grain.</p>

<p><strong>BOIL</strong>
I should have taken a starting gravity reading here, but i didn't! I did however use my glass thermometer to allow me to calculate the volume of wort as being 5.5 litres.</p>

<p>I added my first wort hops and put maximum heat on and brought the wort to a boil (no lid), I now added 2 more litres of water (i think should have done before it started boiling) i figured it was better to add more water before boil completion as it would definitely be sanitary, <strong>perhaps there is a better reason not to do this?</strong> I let it boil for 90 mins (no lid). 15 mins before the end of boil I added 1 Protofloc tablet.</p>

<p><strong>STEEP</strong>
I added about 1 litre of cold sanitary water and got the temperature between 75°C and 79°C, added the aroma hops and let them steep for 30 mins.</p>

<p><strong>LIQUOR BACK</strong>
I took a gravity reading, and using a online calculator worked out the gravity at 20°C was 1.105 (i think), i was sure how water to add so i just added <em>some</em> and got to just under 12 litres at 20°C and what i settled as being my Original Gravity of 1.044, meaning i diluted it too much without getting near 20 litre batch, hence my reason for this post.</p>

<p><strong>COOL for PITCHING</strong>
I put the lid on and sealed it with starsan covered clingfilm and placed the pot in the sink in cold water (7°C). This took me hours, as i didn't have ice and only half the pot was in contact with the cold water. [I'm going to make a wort chiller even for this smallish pot or at the very least boil and freeze some water the night before to liquor back with.]</p>

<p>The target was stated as being 8°C, but as the yeast is happy at 8°C to 12°C, i ended up settling for 12°C before i transferred to FV and dumped all the yeast in and gave it a good shake. My FV fridge is set to 8°C and certainly fermentation had started 24 hours later, but it was by no means a vigorous airlock bubbling like you get with an ale at 20°C.</p>

<p>I realized later my yeast amount was for a 20 litre, so i presume i've over pitched, but i understand that's preferable to under pitching, but that has nothing to do with my mash efficiency which is the suspected reason for my poor wort concentration.</p>

"First batch result","<p>I'm know enjoying my first batch of beer. I think, it will be some kinda use for those who are hesitating to start their brew or still researching. I did quite much research before i did brew. </p>

<p>During brew day I was much afraid of contaminating wort. It happened at some level but finished beer is ok. I will explain how.</p>

<p>First, I malted my own barley and roasted it. It took me quite long time to malt 5 kg of barley at home conditions.</p>

<p>Secondly, I thought that crushing malt with roller pin would gave me the same output as malt mill but I was mistaken. As a result, half of the malt wasn't cracked at all. I found out about it after brew by observing steeped malt. So, my advice here is that you better use grain mill, or blender if you don't have a mill.</p>

<p>Thirdly, It took me about 40-50 minutes to cool down 15Lof hot wort from 100C to 22C in cold bath. As I don't have a wort chiller. My advice: buy or make one for yourself. Unfortunately, I added some 5L more water but it lowered gravity. My advice is not to overadjust gravity of your wort. Do it little by little.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I did sanitation with StarSan while cooling wort down. However, I got infection somehow. The wort didn't ferment much, only 5-7 days then it stopped. But i didn't touch it until 14 days after sealing it. Bottled beer with brown sugar, it worked well. </p>

<p>Fifthly, I had ordered wort racking cane late, therefore I had to pour wort from carboy glass to bottles through cotton and cloth filter but it was inefficient. Some of the yeast got into bottles. Do not repeat my mistake.
After 2 weeks I tasted my beer. It was well carbonated, around 1.5% alcohol and some sour taste. I did research about sour taste, it happens bcoz of infection from cold side of storage. Full article here: </p>

In general, i am happy with my first result. I was afraid to ruin everything.</p>

<p>Here is the recipe:</p>

<p>4.5kg caramel malt (malted and roasted myself)
0.5kg dark malt malted and roasted myself)
1 bar of dark chocolate
30gr Sapphire hops at 60 min
30gr Sapphire hops at 30 min
30gr Sapphire hops at 0 min
1 tbsp of baker's yeasts. 
20L water during step mashing
5L water after boil 
Result:
Aroma: Chocolate, nutty, citrus
Flavor: Sour, chocolate,
Color: reddish-brown</p>

"Step mash and under modified malts","<p>I’ve been reading about <a href=""https://beerandbrewing.com/belgian-beer-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/"" rel=""noreferrer"">common mistakes</a> with Belgian beers and it’s been noted that a “real” Belgian beer requires a step mash. The reason given for this is that apparently this is required for good head formation and retention. </p>

<p>The article also mentions that this will only work with under modified malts and not your typical well modified pilsner. </p>

<p>Given that malting effectively does the same job as a protein rest step (gets the enzymes churning away) what is the benefit?</p>

"Best yeast for bottle conditioning","<p>I’ve used Safale F-2 and sometimes CBC-1 for bottle conditioning with good results. Doing so, flavour impact has been minimal. It also drops its dead clear once bottle fermentation is mostly done. It also goes beyond 10% ABV so residual sugar is also minimal for high gravity beers. Alcohol doesn’t kill the yeast easily.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any other general purpose yeast strains suitable for bottle conditioning?</li>
<li>Is there an easy way to measure F-2? I frequently do batches of 5L, 1.3 US gallon. Packaging says 2-7 g per 100L, which means a minuscule 0.2 g per batch for me.</li>
<li>Among my group of brewer friends I’m alone in pitching fresh yeast for bottle conditioning. But it’s recommended when racking on a secondary fermentation vessel, right? Some of my stouts and Belgian ales spend 1-3 months on a secondary (and it sure feels like the yeast isn’t very active any more).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Elaborated the third question about long secondary.</p>

"Ballpark yeast count of starter from harvested commercial yeast","<p>I've harvested some yeast from a commercial bottle (Maine Beer Company's Mo Pale Ale) and stepped it up to a 1L size. I'll be making a pale ale at ~1.055 OG and everything I read indicates I'll want roughly 180-200 billion cells and that about 1L of starter should get me there. But that's 1L of starter built from standard starting points (like liquid vial) so I don't really know if my 1L starter is remotely in the right ballpark.</p>

<p>Here's what I've done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added slurry from one beer to 250ml starter wort (25g DME, 250g water)</li>
<li>2 days: Observed thin layer of bubbles</li>
<li>3 days: Doubled the starter (added another 250ml, total 500ml)</li>
<li>3.5 days: Observed very nice looking krausen</li>
<li>4.5 days (36 hrs since last feeding): Doubled the starter (added 500ml, total 1L)</li>
</ul>

<p>My plan is 24 hours after the final feeding to refrigerate it for 2-3 days until I brew, decant most of the liquid, and pitch the yeast.</p>

<p>Does this sound like I will reasonably hit my ballpark for cell counts? Should I look for any particular volume of settled-out yeast to validate approximate cell counts?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I doubled again to a total of 2L of starter wort. After another day I refrigerated it 2 days before brewing and I poured out most of the liquid. I brewed a pale ale and from what I can tell fermentation was strong. I ended up with 5.9% ABV, 81% attenuation. </p>

With the remains of the malted oats I had left over about 30% of the oats are from the new unmalted oats. Flaked oats are used to impart the smoothness and better mouthfeel so it begs the question as to which is better for that.</p>

The use of dextrose is new to me.</p>

Let's say it's hypothetical.  You're brewing from extract.  You cool your wort, transfer it to your fermenter, add your top-off water, and take a gravity reading.  You discover that your OG is much lower than you expect.  You shake the fermenter a bunch and take another reading.  Still low.  So you look at the recipe.  You see it called for:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.75 lb DME</li>
<li>6.6 lb LME</li>

"[WIKI] Characteristics of a Good Cellaring Beer","<p>Every once and a while I come across <a href=""http://www.gooseisland.com/pages/matilda/25.php"" rel=""nofollow"">beers</a> that say they can be kept up to 5 years and become more developed over that time period, while <a href=""http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/index.cfm?pid=143703"" rel=""nofollow"">other beers</a> that are of the same style don't indicate this at all.  I know that some styles are defined by how long they can be cellared, but for other styles how do you know?  So my main question is:</p>

<p><strong>What are the main characteristics that differentiate normal cellaring period beers from beers with extended cellaring periods?</strong>  Does it have to do with the amount of hops?  The amount of alcohol?  The type of yeast?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In retrospect, this looks like it would be a good wiki question since it's more of an information gathering topic than a personal, concise question. </p>

<p><strong>Here is a compiled list of comments made below as well as answers found elsewhere:</strong>
<br><em>Please feel free to edit this list (it is a wiki).</em></p>

<p><strong>These are the characteristics that people have associated with good cellaring beers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Wild yeast beers</li>
<li>High alcohol content</li>
<li>Proper storage throughout the lifetime of the beer</li>
<li>High SRM/EBC -- Dark Color</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Styles of beers that lend themselves to cellaring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lambic</li>
<li>Barleywine</li>
<li>Oud Bruin</li>
<li>Belgian Ale</li>
<li>Imperial Stout</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Characteristics that can develop throughout cellaring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floral hop character diminishes</li>
<li>Hop bitterness diminishes, but at a much slower rate</li>
<li>Flavor complexity is developed</li>
<li>Malt character is developed</li>
<li>Can develop sherry and port-like characteristics</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep these characteristics in mind when selecting or designing a beer that you wish to cellar for an extended period of time.</em></p>

<p>I would like to step up the starter to get a larger volume of yeast, but I'm not entirely clear on the proper process for this.

"Should I ferment a new batch directly on the yeast cake generated by the previous batch?","<p>I'm going to re-use the yeast cake from a low-gravity batch to ferment a high-gravity batch.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Can I just put the wort directly on it?  Does it then need to be agitated?</li>
<li>Is it worth the risk of contamination to take the whole yeast cake out, wash it, strain it, and actually re-pitch it?</li>
<li>Is there a term for this complete re-use of a yeast cake?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Pouring down on the yeast cake of the previous batch is something I do regularly and with great effect. I don't remove anything from the carboy and I only step up in gravity. This might be helped by the fact that I only use leaf hops and they do a great job latching onto break material. I also use a boil screen, so there's very little trub anyway.</p>

<p>Yes, you can put the wort directly in. No, it doesn't need to be agitated, but a bit of shaking for aeration doesn't hurt.</p>

<p>I can't speak to risk of contamination with removing and repitching slurry, but I can say that the risk of contamination with pouring down is less.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I still do this regularly with good results. I wanted to do some testing on how much ester production is inhibited by this degree of overpitching, so I tried making a light saison, with Wyeast French Saison (3711). (It's amazing yeast, by the way.) It was effectively Northern Brewer's Petite Saison d'Ete recipe, but at a <code>1.036</code> gravity. I made that batch, kegged it, then poured down a 1.080 <em>biere de garde</em> onto the cake. Fermentation was vigorous and healthy. The beer is missing nothing in the ester/character department. This beer had as much character and interest as anything I've made, even with being massively overpitched by homebrew standards. </p>

<p>Long story short: you can make very good beer like this, especially big beers.</p>

"Fast versus Slow Fermentation","<p>So I pitched a cider and the yeast blitzed through the batch in 48 hours (SG=1.050, FG=1.000). I noticed that the temperature went from 72F to over 76F during the fermentation (I really don't have a way to control the temperature of the carboy, the room temperature was 70F).

<p>Here is the basis for my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Palmer's reference has very few off flavors that he mentions as a function of cleaning and none from using scratched fermenters. So, if you know that you are using proper sanitizing technique, have you still produced off flavors? If so, were you able to track down the source as something different than Palmer's observations?  </li>

"HopRocket (hopback) questions: ""captive"" wort and effect at beginning vs. end of run","<p>Brewed a double IPA last Sunday and used a HopRocket as a hopback for the first time (standard setup: kettle -> HopRocket -> counterflow chiller -> fermenter using gravity feed.) Overall very pleased with the device. Seemed to add a hop character that was quite different than hops in the kettle or dry hopping. We brew 10G batches and split the output from the kettle into 2 carboys. First half of the ""drain"" goes into one carboy, last into the second.</p>

<p>I'm interested in knowing if anyone has done any testing on the effects of a hopback at the beginning vs. end of the run. Will there be noticeable differences between the carboys? We thought about swapping the output hose more frequently to try and even out any differences, but that seemed like too much work. For those of you that use a hopback and split the output, how do you handle this?</p>

<p>Aside from being a little sad that my yield is down to 3.5 gallons, I have a couple concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the large amount of stuff that settled out going to affect my ABV calculations? I.e., was all that stuff in suspension originally, and artificially inflated my OG reading (1.072)?</li>

"Considering adding Fresh Ginger to a 'Simply Ginger Beer' kit","<p>I'm about to start a brew using a 'Simply Ginger Beer' kit. I've heard that it's sweet, and light which is what I want, but it's not very gingery. Would it be ok to add some grated and boiled fresh ginger at the point the batch is first made up? Or would it be better to add it after a week or so? </p>

<p>The next obvious question is: What would be a good starting quantity? I'm not sure if we're talking 50g or 500g! </p>

<p>Other info:
I'm fermenting it in a 5 gallon glass carboy. 
Will be using 1kg brew enhancer.
Will be using the included yeast/sweetener sachet.
I plan to bottle it in flip-tops at the end.</p>

"Making a starter without DME?","<p>Planning to start to use liquid yeasts and will need to do some starters.</p>

<p>It is hard to get hold of DME over here (I can get some hopped LME, though).</p>

<p>I was thinking on doing a starter from grains, do I need to do a full 60 min boil for the starter?</p>

<p>In theory all the sugars the yeast will need are already on the wort when I finish mashing so a short boil (or even pasteurization) just to cripple the competition would be enough? Or do I need to care about DMS, proteins and such for the starter?</p>

"Ensuring an accurate gravity reading","<p>So I've brewed between 6-10 batches of beer at home using partial boil methods but have never managed to get accurate gravity readings. </p>

<p>The issue I have is that my readings somehow always seem to be way higher than most  gravity-abv charts ive seen allow for, even when i try and account for temperature.</p>

<p>For example, today I brewed something akin to a DIPA which used 9 lbs of liquid malt (6 pilsner, 3 amber) in a 5 gallon batch. After adding a hops, chilling and adding water to get to the desired 5 gallons, I extracted some and got an OG reading of 1.12 which puts me in the running for maybe a 15% abv beer, which seems hard for me to believe.</p>

<p>Is this a reasonable number considering how much malt I used? Something I have noticed is that in my OG readings theres always a very large amount of sediment since I usually extract the liquid soon after everything is in my fermentation chamber. Could this sediment be affecting my readings?</p>

<p>as a small aside, i've been trying to use a wine thief to get readings and it always seems to get clogged due to high amounts of sediment in the fermentor. Is there a way around this aside from getting something akin to a turkey baster?</p>

"Forgot bottle capper - priming interrupted","<p>I was all ready to bottle up my IPA last night (and yes, since this is StackExchange, I named the brew ""IPAddress"").

I grab the first bottle, a cap, and....and where's the capper?</p>

<p>I spent the majority of last night turning my apartment over, looking for the dang thing. No dice - my best guess is I left it behind at my former apartment in a drawer. I re-airlocked the brew, having exhausted my options, and am going to purchase a new capper.</p>

<p>At this point, what are the effects on the finished beer going to be? Introducing more sugar is going to introduce more alcohol, and I have to wait until the yeast has chewed through everything I just introduced to it before attempting to prime it again. Am I freaking out unnecessarily?</p>

"Recovering from low mash efficiency - under-shot pre-boil gravity","<p>For whatever reason, Beersmith decided to have me lauter my all-grain recipe with an exorbitant amount of water.  I don't have the exact recipe in front of me at the moment (can provide details later if necessary), but from what I recall looking at the brew steps, I was aiming for a 6 gallon batch, and it had me mashing with 4.5 gallons, sparging with ~9.  I knew something was off when I looked at the brew step that said I should end the boil with 7.5 gallons, to achieve a 6 gallon amount for fermentation. </p>

<p>I have no idea how these numbers came about, but I certainly did not sparge with all 9 gallons.  Maybe 7-8, and my pre-boil gravity was well under what Beersmith estimated.  It was a batch sparge, no mash out.  Again, I can't provide specifics at this very moment, but instead of correcting that recipe, I was more curious about what can be done in the event that your pre-boil gravity is lower than expected?</p>

<p>In my case I had between 7 - 8 gallons going into the boil kettle, I just let it boil down for about 1 - 2 hours before I began my hop additions.  In the long run, surprisingly I wound up at about 5.5 - 6 gallons of wort to go into the fermenter when it was all said and done, but what is the normal method for correcting an under-shot pre-boil gravity?  Is sacrificing quantity the only way of correcting this sort of shortcoming?</p>

<li>Wait another week</li>
<li>Warm it up (it is sitting at 17C now) and stir to rouse the yeast and wait another week</li>
<li>Pitch some WLP099 Super high gravity and wait another week</li>

"Can I use my CO2 regulator as a inside keg pressure checker?","<p>If I force carbonate my keg, and after that I close my CO2 cilinder valve and plug my gas line into my gas in quick disconnect.

<p>If not, there is a way to properly measure the psi inside the keg without buying a pressure gauge for that? That's my plan on future, but for now I need to force carbonate (fast way) a keg, but don't want to take much time in trial and error when go dispensing my beer to get a perfect pouring. There is about 6 hours to my event, not enough time to the 'set it and forget' method. My kegs are pin lock, and doesn't have a pressure relief valve, what makes adjusting pressure when serving a little more difficult.</p>

"Cider fermentation stuck/stopped","<p>I attempted to make apple cider, buying Kirkland apple juice (6 Gallons) and 500g dextrose. All i did was pour in the juice and pitched the yeast (s04) ontop of the juice at about 20deg Celsius, O.G reading of 1056. The fermentation kicked off strong, bubbling and dropping gravity to 1034, here it has stopped on day 4 for the last 4 days. The wort did drop to 17deg celsius but aparrently this is within its temperature range? I have since raised the temp to 20-22 steady, and nothing... Should I pitch another packet of yeast? Is there any saving the cider?</p>

"Is it possible to do pressurized fermentation in a mini keg?","<p>I have been keen on moving from bottles to use kegs in my amateur home brews. Due to a lack of space and because I just like the size and mobility of the smaller kegs I'd like to try to use multiple <a href=""http://shop.humle.se/shop/11011/art11/h7236/9937236-origpic-46bcdb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mini kegs of about 5L size</a> for a 20L+ brew.</p>

<p>I read about a trick for how to force carbonate the beer in mini kegs using sodastream bottles which seemed to make for a pretty convenient process.</p>

<p>I have also been <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9750/what-are-the-benefits-of-fermenting-under-pressure/9751#9751"">reading about pressurized fermentation</a> directly in the keg as a way to remove the carbonation step from the process which seems beneficial to me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have not been able to find any good sources on if this is feasible or not. I'm assuming that a mini keg can take the pressure, considering it can be force carbonated, although it would probably need a pressure release valve so it can be kept under a certain pressure (2-3 bar?).</p>

<p>I'm thinking it would mean a process similar to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Brew wort.</li>
<li>Cool wort.</li>
<li>Fill mini kegs with wort, aerate and pitch each keg with yeast.</li>
<li>Fit kegs with pressure release valves set to a certain bar (and perhaps adjust over time?).</li>
<li>Let it ferment and carbonate for 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Tap the keg through a filter into glass and cheers!</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the <a href=""http://www.williamswarn.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.williamswarn.com/</a> uses a similar process, but in a smart little machine with built in boiler. </p>

"What's the minimum size for a jockey box?","<p>I'm planning on build one cooler based dispensing system for my kegs. My previous experience was with a box with 2 aluminium coils (~15m long) and 2 faucets. It holds a 20 Kg ice pack. And the beer pour is just fine when the carbonation and settings are OK.</p>

<p>But, I've found that for a period of a party/beer session, that amount of ice is overshoot. If full of ice, the box let you drink cold beer for about 3 days very easy. I don't think that I need so much power to enjoy one or 2 kegs.</p>

<p>I want to repeat the coil size because its easy to buy here and I think its long enough. And my goal is to make the more portable system, so I will shot for just one line/faucet.</p>

<ul>
<li>how much small sized it could be to hold the coil and the ice?</li>
<li>What's the minimum amount of ice to get the beer cold enough? (the temperature range of my city is within 15-32ºC, 20-25º most days; and I want to have an ice autonomy of at least 5 hours or 2-3 corny-kegs ful dispensing.)</li>

The beer is much sweeter than I was expecting and the alcohol content is ~3-3.5% (should be 4.5%).  Am I right in thinking that this may be because the yeast hasn't worked to its full potential meaning that the sugar may not have been converted to alcohol?

"My mead tastes sour. Did I make honey wine or is it spoiled?","<p>My mead tastes sour like dry white wine!</p>

<p>I made a batch of mead this January, just under 10L.
It was made from honey that had fermented a bit (I got it cheap), but I boiled it with the water, so that would have been killed.</p>

<p>It was poured on two 5L jugs that were disinfected, and added some herb ""tea"" (also boiled), thyme in one, christmas-themed spices in the other.</p>

<p>I used port-yeast.
I have previously made a batch from the same batch of honey that turned out fine, but then I used baking yeast.</p>

<p>Today I tried pouring over the mead from the jugs to bottles as it had cleared beautifully and stopped bubbling. The tops of the jugs has been covered with standard fermenting tubes with water in them.</p>

<p>As I poured, I tasted a bit, and it tastes nothing like mead.It's very sour, like a dry white wine. I don't like dry wine, so I think it tastes awful. But if I actually made honey wine, I don't want to toss it but rather give it away to someone who does like dry wine.</p>

"How was beer brewed in ancient times without thermometers and electricity?","<p>I have read on Wikipedia that beer is a really ancient beverage brewed many millenia ago. However, thermometer is only several hundred centuries old, and electricity is an even newer invention.</p>

<p>How is it possible to brew beer without thermometers and electric heating elements (or gas stoves)? My opinion is that both are really necessary. Without a thermometer, you cannot know the temperature of mashing. If the temperature is too high, you have too much sugars that are not fermentable, and if the temperature is too low, the beer will become too dry. All of this, of course, assumes that one has approximately the correct temperature for the enzymes that convert starches to sugars. It is very hard for me to understand how one could have the temperature even approximately correct, because the mashing temperatures are so high that feeling the temperature with your fingers is not possible. So, my intuition is that without a thermometer, even converting the starches to sugars should be very hard.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you don't have electric heating elements or gas stoves, it is almost impossible to control the rate of heating. With heating being done by burning wood, the control is very crude and the time constants of control are long. So, even if thermometers had been available in ancient times, controlling the temperature of the mash would be very hard.</p>

<p>The part of boiling, of course, is easy because water in liquid form cannot exist above 100 degrees Celcius. Chilling the wort might be tricky, but there is plenty of evidence that even the ""no chill"" method can work. Fermentation temperature control obviously requires a solution, but fermentation temperature is not as critical as mashing temperature, and fermentation temperature can be approximately measured by feeling the temperature with your fingers.</p>

<p>Has anybody here brewed beer without measuring the mashing temperature and without using a temperature-controlled oven? If so, did it go well?</p>

"Off flavours from unsanitized priming sugar","<p>Quick question for the group: Will unsanitized priming tablets/sugar likely/surely cause off flavours after bottle conditioning - especially, a wet/slightly moldy towel aroma?</p>

<p>I've been experiencing this off aroma/flavour consistently after bottle conditioning - and it's NOT present out of the fermentor (tastes excellent initially). Fairly sure my AG process is decent, sanitary, and it's not a yeast or ferment temp problem.  Newbie question, but I've been using Cooper's dextrose tablets, and/or white sugar added directly to the bottles for priming. For my latest batch I boiled white sugar and primed in a bottling bucket as per traditional method - and I tasted a bottle after a week, and it was amazing - with no off flavours (yet;), and on par with what I would have expected out of the fermentor.

"Is it possible to know how many volumes of CO2 end up in a keg after force carbonating?","<p>There are two methods used to carbonate a keg:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set and forget</li>
<li>Force carbonation</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first method, the keg's PSI is set to a value determined by a kegging chart and is left at that PSI for the duration of the beers life. Some time after 1-2 weeks, the beer is fully carbonated and the exact volumes of CO2 in the beer is known.</p>

<p>In the second method, the keg's PSI is set to around 30 and left there for 24-36 hours, before being brought down back to ""serving pressure"" which is typically the same value as set in the first method. Some people may purge the keg before dropping the PSI, and others may shake the keg.</p>

<p>I have heard that when we force carbonate, it is not possible to know the exact volumes of CO2 in the beer. Is this true? I would think that the beer would eventually equalize out to the PSI at the serving temperature. If this is not true - why isn't it? If I set the PSI to 30 for only 1 hour (instead of 48), does the same apply? How about 1 minute?</p>

<p>I normally use a whirlfloc tablet, but in the hustle a my first all-grain I  forgot to add it. I wonder if it would have dropped a lot of this out?</p>

<p>I read the cloud could be grain flour, I didn't crush my own, I bought it precrushed, but read that it SHOULD have settled out by the first week? Also wouldn't this cloud be in the wort prior to boiling?</p>

<p>Also read it could be tannins with proteins, a haze that doesn't go away and may cause off flavors.</p>

  yeast) and seeing how the flavor is then. How much would the flavors
  improve aging for a year? 2 year? 5? 10? At what point would I see
  diminishing returns?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>My second (ever) batch of cider is currently entering secondary fermentation, and has left me wondering how long I should age my Cider.</p>

<p>The first batch of cider I made was done ""hastily"" and I consumed it within a few weeks of bottle conditioning. The flavor tasted like biting into a green apple and was very dry since I didn't back-sweeten it. Based on the common knowledge available this appears to be characteristic of ""young cider"", whose flavors I would like to try mellowing out by aging.</p>

<p>I found that a <strong>period of 3-6 months is the typical recommendation for aging cider</strong>. I've also read forums on home-brewing sites that higher ABV ciders benefit more from a longer aging period. The <strong>initial hydrometer reading of my cider tells me that I can ferment up to just under 10% ABV</strong> if I ferment the cider dry (which my yeast seems to do). <strong>This is a bit higher than the typical cider abv.</strong></p>

<p>As a side note about long aging times I'm not really concerned about the cider becoming vinegar (see cider notes*), so I don't think that is a factor for me. Obviously I don't really plan on aging my cider for super long periods of time (longer than 20 years), which I think would be excessive.</p>

It then states that it should be kept between 18 and 20 degrees.</p>

<p>However, what temperature is ""cold water""? I live in Scotland. The first batch I did was in the winter; tap water is so cold it actually hurts your hand. Compare that with a warm region and you could be talking about a difference of 15 or 20 degrees C. Nonetheless, following these intructions I end up with the brew way up at almost 30 deg C.</p>

<p>What I am wondering is whether these kits are <em>supposed</em> to be kicked off at a higher temperature and then left to settle down to the ideal 18-20 zone?</p>

<p>It would far clearer if they replaced their nonsense about ratios of hot vs ""cold"" water, and simply told you what temperature to aim for!</p>

He didn't have any of THOSE left, however he did have an assembly to use an 8-gallon pot as a lauter tun. So I stopped by the hardware store, purchased a step drill, modified the pot for a valve, screen filter, and thermometer (also a purchase @ the HB store), but not before I had walked out of the homebrew store with the ingredients for a Belgian Dubbel and an extra fermentor:</p>

<p>1 lb Briess American Dextrin (carapils malt)
7.5 lbs Muntons English Maris Otter Malt
0.1 lbs Weyermann German Dehusked CaraFa II
0.5 lbs Dingemans Belgian Aromatic Malt
1 lb Dingemans Beglian Special B
1 lb candi sugar
1 lb honey (he had this AWESOME stuff called ""Meadowfoam"", which is truly delicious, to the point where I may make some meade from it)
1oz Brewers Gold pellets (60 min)
1/2 oz Hallertau (20 min)
1/4 oz Hallertau (10 min)
Wyeast #1214 Belgian Abbey Yeast</p>

<p>I came out with a 1.030 boil gravity. Adjusted for temperature, this was closer to 1.045.

"What are the effects of transferring a mash before lautering?","<p>In my latest batch I ended up with a stuck mash due to me mis-assembling the false bottom. To solve this, I transferred the mash to a bucket, fixed the false bottom, put the mash back in the MLT and lautered as normal.</p>

<p>Before transferring the mash, the wort was clear. After transferring the mash, the wort was very cloudy.</p>

<p>This cloudiness carried over into the boil and I ended up with the most trub-filled batch I've ever made. Normally I'll get 2-3 quarts of trub in a 6 gallon batch. In this batch I got almost 6 quarts.</p>

<p>Did transferring the wort cause this excessive trub? If so, how? And how could I avoid this problem in the future. (other than always assembling the false bottom correctly, obviously)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: </p>

<p>Yes, there really are two problems here: a super-cloudy wort and a trub-filled wort. They might not be related. The grist was 40% American 2-row, which is not an ingredient I normally use. Based on the massive kreusen I'm seeing in the fermenter, I'm guessing that the 2-row contributed <em>a lot</em> of protein to this beer.</p>

<p>Does it have to do with infection of the wine? Is an open fermentation method not suitable once the wine stops producing a lot of CO2 on it's own? Or are the glass carboys recommended for visually determining the clarity of the wine and thus when you want to bottle?</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr My question is basically ""Can I use a lidded plastic bucket for my secondary fermentation/clearing process? Or are glass carboys a necessity for the secondary?""</strong></p>

"What do I risk for leaving my beer exposed to open air through the airlock hole?","<p>I brew away from home, and last weekend I has to rush away before I was completely racking from primary to secondary. I can only go back in about 10 days.
As a result, my beer is now sitting in a bucket with the lid on but with no airlock (exposed to open air through the airlock's hole).
It's a pale blond ale with pitched with S-04 yeast about 3 weeks ago.
Besides contamination risk, what do I risk ? Oxidation ? Anything else ?

"Not enough wort after boil","<p>I did a 5 litre brew yesterday, a California Common Beer, I did it as per the recipe, with the steep time and the 60 min boil, and I ended up with 2.5 litres of wort from a starting liquid of 7.37 litres, a 75 min steep and a 10 min sparge with flame on and then a 60 min boil. I topped it up with fresh water to 4 litres, probably a fail....What can I do to avoid this over evaporation in the future???

<li>I recently washed my yeast from a batch of beer using something like <a href=""http://beersmith.com/blog/2008/07/25/yeast-washing-reusing-your-yeast/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>. I got 5 jars of yeast out of this, and I assume I can brew 5 batches of beer from these. So what exactly is 4 - 6 generations? Because If I take the yeast from another batch of beer, I can get another 5 jars again. Are all of those considered generation 2?</li>

<li>Could I just buy a microscope and learn how to do a yeast viability test on my own? Or do I need a microbiology degree for that?</li>
<li>Whats the ideal temperature to keep the yeast? I have them in the refrigerator, but I am not sure if that temperature is correct or not. Will the yeast die if its to cold?</li>

"How can I fix low starting gravity?","<p>I made my third all-grain batch last weekend. I have had issues getting decent efficiency so I added a couple extra pounds of ESB malted barley (11lbs, instead of 9, and about 3lbs of specialty grain).</p>

<p>My mash was 154F (167 strike, 17 quarts), and I let it sit for an hour before draining. I batch sparged with 185F water (was 170F, 18 quarts), and let it sit for 20 minutes before draining into my pot. I use a cooler, and there was very little movement on the temp.</p>

<p>But the wort that came out of the mash tun was about 1.025 on the hydrometer. I got about 7.5 gallons out, and it boiled down to be about 5 gallons, so I am guessing it was about 1.037 post-boil (I didn't take a reading). The recipe called for a 1.053</p>

<p>The airlock started bubbling about 36 hours later, but it slowed down quickly. I am guessing there wasn't enough sugar from my extraction to keep it going.</p>

"Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager for Bock - too late for diacetyl rest?","<p>I really wasn't ready to do a lager, but I wanted to do a Bock, so I requested California Lager yeast.  My supplier failed to make the substitution and sent me home with Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager.  I was snowed in and the temperature in my garage would be around 40°-50° for a couple weeks, so I decided to roll with it.  After two weeks of fermentation at 42-48°F, it started getting warmer (~52°F).  After about 2 days at that temp I decided to take a gravity reading, and found that I was sitting at 1.015.  I tasted it and it wasn't too bad, but there was a hint of diacetyl (totally drinkable in my mind).  I gave a sample to my wife and asked her to describe the taste...</p>

<p>Wife: ""Tastes like a hamburger""<br/>
Me: ""A hamburger?""<br/>
Wife: ""Yeah, like a Sonic hamburger.""<br/>
Me: ""Like, buttery?""<br/>

Great, I thought, my fermentation is complete, so I'll bring it up to 58 and let it sit for a day and see if that helps.  It's been about 12 hours, but I'm a little nervous that the warmer temp will make the problem worse, and I've been reading that I should've done a d-rest much sooner.</p>

"yeast cell count importance","<p>I have a had a question for quite some time that nobody has been able to answer.  The question is more academic or theoretical than it is practical.  Perhaps the community here is a tad smarter (nerdier?) than other brewing forums.  Everywhere I go, people say that higher yeast cell counts are better.  Got a high gravity wort? Use two yeast packs.  Got a couple days before brew day? Use a yeast starter.  My question is <em>why</em> does this matter.</p>

<p>It seems that, theoretically, if you threw one yeast cell in the wort, it would munch on some sugar, and reproduce.  Then it would repeat this cycle until all the fermentable sugar was gone and there would be many many many yeast cells at that point.  Seemingly, the only difference between this pitching millions of yeast cells is that presumably the single yeast cell situation would take longer to get to the end point.  </p>

<p>Obviously, this is somewhat contrived. Perhaps the single cell dies before reproducing?  Ignore issues like that for the point of this question.  Why is it important to have many many many yeast cells?</p>

"Is aerobic fermentation in beer brewing a myth?","<p>The more I read about yeast and fermentation, the more conflicting, confusing (and possibly incorrect) statements I come across.</p>

<p>I have read in several bits of literature that yeast requires oxygen for biosynthesis (i.e. cell growth) and prefers to use it for this purpose, to which end it absorbs oxygen shortly after pitching (i.e. during the lag phase and before fermentation begins). Many sources indicate that almost all the dissolved oxygen is absorbed by the yeast within 30-180 minutes after pitching and is thereby removed from the wort.</p>

<p>Which begs the question if there is such a thing as ""aerobic fermentation"" in brewing. I mean, if the oxygen is being removed from the wort, aerobic fermentation (fermentation in an environment that exposes the yeast to oxygen, which not necessarily means the yeast will use oxygen for fermentation) is impossible without adding more oxygen after the lag phase (which, to the best of my knowledge, is neither recommended nor common practice).</p>

<p>As I understand it, yeast absorbs oxygen and nutrients from the wort during the lag phase and uses it for the synthesis of ATP, sterols and fatty acids which are stored in the cells. Then, following the lag phase, anaerobic fermentation starts, during which stage most cell growth takes place.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does aerobic fermentation has a place in this? If so, when and how, and where does the oxygen come from?</li>
<li>Does the yeast use sugar for biosynthesis (i.e. cell formation)?</li>
<li>What about anaerobic cell growth? I remember reading somewhere that yeast can multiply anaerobically, but the cells produced differ from those synthesized aerobically.</li>

"Stuck fermentation - how long to leave it for?","<p>Porter, sitting at a steady 22 degrees, should be 5.2% abv, fermentation stopped at 2.5%</p>

<p>If it matters, I'll be brewing on an induction cooktop, so I won't have to worry about the heat from a propane flame on the spigot. Does this change the equation?</p>

"Improvements for Geordie Winter Warmer","<p>I've just started a single can Geordie Winter Warmer kit and having read some negative reviews about this kit turning out ""weak"" and ""watery"" and like ""beer flavoured soda water"" I'm naturally having doubts about it.</p>

<p>**</p>

<h2>Steps taken so far</h2>

<p>**</p>

<p>Can of Geordie Winter Warmer
1kg dextrose (wish I'd used dme)
300g black treacle (I've read this can improve the body of a brew)*
100g honey*
100g muscovado sugar*
1tbsp ground cinnamon
1tsp ground ginger
(*=whatever sugary stuff I had left in the cupboard, basically - thought by adding this I could improve the OG which came out at 1038 @ 22litres...final OG was 1042)</p>

<p>Yeast is off to a flying start and has around 3-4cm krausen on top about 7hours after pitching. Temperature is around 23 degrees celsius. In hindsight I would have brewed it much shorter at around 18 litres.</p>

<p>**</p>

<h2>Potential improvements?</h2>

<p>**</p>

<p>An OG of 1042 is lower than what I would want for a full bodied winter warmer (first try - but having done some reading this does seem low) so I was wondering whether I could add some extra dark DME + yeast starter in stages as the fermentation subsides to try to raise the ABV and hopefully improve the malty body of the beer.</p>

<p>**</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>**</p>

<p>Are there any suggestions of how else I could improve this potential Grinch of a winter warmer? Ideally I would like an ABV around 5-6% but more importantly a sweeter beer with plenty of malty body. Is it too late to do anything about this now?</p>

"Transfert wort in a cube then chill it","<p>I just started the hobby and only brewed two kits. So far I brewed in a 5L (1.3G) kettle. I did the chilling by using a cold bath in my kitchen sink. </p>

<p>So far so good. I plan to buy a proper brew kettle (30L/8G) but it wont fit in my sink. Therefore I'm looking for a chilling solution. I don't want to invest on any equipment and I can't plug an immersion chiller on my kitchen or bathroom faucet anyway.</p>

<p>I found the no-chill solution which gave me the following idea: why not transfert the wort in 10L (2.5G) cubes that fits in my sink and cold bath them (I plan to brew 20L batches max so 2 cubes). <a href=""http://www.aussiehomebrewer.com/articles/article56.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is written the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not be tempted to cool the cube prematurely by putting it into a
  swimming pool or other body of water. Rapidly cooled hot packed wort
  can give rise to infections as it does not allow for the cube to be
  exposed to the hot wort for long enough to ensure that any bacteria in
  the cube is killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long should I wait before cold bathing the cube so it's heat sanatized? (I think that's the reason why it should not be iced bath right away?)</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that my question question has been misunderstood. I don't specifically wants to do the no chill solution. I'm just looking for a way to do cold bath chilling with a kettle bigger than my sink. My other solution would be to find a big stainless buket to use for the cold bath. Or is there any plastic bucket than can handle the heat? (I'm afraid that if the hot kettle touch the bucket it would melt.)</p>

<p>EDIT2: I double check I can't screw an adaptaor on any of my faucets so I can't use an imersion chiller.</p>

"First Batch Bottle Exploded","<p>I'm in the bottling phase with my first batch of beer.  Came home last night and one of the bottles had exploded.</p>

<p>The beer spent 7 days in the primary fermenter and hit the target gravity per the kit.  Then 2 1/2 weeks in the secondary.</p>

<p>When I transferred to the primary fermenter, I poured the liquid back and forth like the kit suggested and it resulted in a lot of foam so it was hard to tell how much water I needed to top off the batch with. By the end of the process I ended up with only 4 gallons instead of 5.</p>

<p>Reading here I think the issue was too much priming sugar (I used what came with the kit which was meant for 5 gallons) combined with storing them in a place that was a bit too warm.. The door to the room I was storing in got shut and furnace warmed it up more than I thought (72+ degrees).</p>

<p>I moved them to the fridge.  Was that the right thing to do?  If so, how long should I leave them in there before drinking?  They were only in the bottles for 5 days before one burst.</p>

"What are the effects of storing unboiled All-Grain Wort at sub-lager temperatures?","<p>Obviously it is better to immediately boil the wort when it is freshest, giving any wild yeist or bacteria as little time as possible to grow and contaminate the product.  It is also a well established practice to mash all of a recipe's different grains together simultaneously.  These practices work wonderfully when brewing a single recipe at a time.</p>

<p>I am knocking around the idea of brewing multiple, smaller (2-3 gallon) batches simultaneously to allow more experimentation in my recipes.  Beyond just revising the hopps/add-in timings, I want to play with the grain-bill, changing the quantities of each grain slightly for each batch.  With extracts, that would be easy, but mashing each small batch seperately would be far too time consuming.</p>

<p>So here is what I have in mind...</p>

<p>Mashing each of my malts and adjuncts seperately in 5-10 gallon batches, then after sparging, cold-crash the resulting ""single-malt"" wort in a chest freezer.  By recording the OG and volume of each seperate batch, I should be able to calculate a grain-weight to wort-volume ratio which I can use later, when translating my grain-bills from weight-based to volume-based.  The mashing could all be done ahead of time, over time and in volume, so that on brew-day, I can start with a freezer full of different, nearly frozen, ""single-malt"" worts.  From there, boiling up a bunch of small custom batches should be quick and easy; just mix in the appropriate ratios of each wort, and proceed to the boil.</p>

<p>So my questions ""boil down to""...</p>

<p>Assuming that the freezer keeps the un-sterilized wort free of wild growth, what other negative-effects should I expect from the wort's time in cold-storage?  </p>

<p>What time scale is safe for storing un-sterilized wort at cold-crash (but not frozen) levels?  (a day, a few days, a week, or hopefully... weeks)</p>

<p>If any of you have tried something like this before, or if you've come up with another method of efficiently experimenting with small all-grain batches, please share your wisdom!</p>

"Large bottles didn't carbonate, but little ones did","<p>Does anyone have an idea if larger bottles (half liter) are harder to carbonate than smaller ones (1/3 liter)?</p>

"Extract Brewing - Cooling down wort by adding cold water?","<p>I don't have a wort chiller yet. I always cool down my wort with 20 pounds of ice and bucket that I place my kettle into.</p>

<p>Since I am extract brewing and will be adding 2.5 gallons of water anyways, I figured why not cool down that water and add it directly to the wort while its in the ice bath? I just did that and the temperature dropped to below 80 in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>However I was brewing a double IPA which required flame-out addition of hops, which I performed in my hop bag. So the flameout hops were only in contact with the wort for about 10 minutes total before I moved transferred the wort to my carboy.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've read that extract brewers use much more hops than full grain brewers due to the former using half as much water.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it bad for an extract brewer to add 2.5-3 gallons of cold water directly to the wort before it cools down?</li>
<li>I should start all grain brewing in 2 weeks (hopefully). Is there any consequences to adding cold water if the evaporation rate took my batch below what I was aiming for?</li>

"Fermentation Done After 2 Days?","<p>So this is a weird one.</p>

<p>3 weeks ago I made an Xmas beer. I brewed it, pitched the #2 yeast, and put the carboy in my cold dark room (about 70 F) to ferment. The fermentation and krausen began about 18 hours after brewing, and lasted for 6 days or so. I measured the FG and it was spot-on so I continued as planned. All was well.</p>

<p>I really like the recipe so I brewed another batch 2 days ago (on Sunday). I pitched the #2 yeast and again put the same carboy in the same dark room at the same temperature. Again, the fermentation / krausen began about 18 hours after brewing. However, tonight I took a look at the carboy only to find that the krausen has completely sunk to the bottom... 4 days earlier than the identical recipe did the last time.</p>

<p>What happened? It's still fermenting given that I can see the 3-piece airlock bubbling, but what is the deal with the super early krausen drop? I'll give it 7 days, measure the FG, and hope for the best, but can anyone explain the reason that batch 1 went 6 days before the krausen dropped and batch 2 went less than 48 hours?!</p>

I have some questions which were not addressed in my generic guide which came with my equipment and kits. I realize some of these questions probably belong on a forum of some sort, but I turn to the StackExchange community for help as I trust the people. My questions are such:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My kit specified the gravity pre-yeast should be 1.049-1.051, when I measured it was 1.041, will this result in a weaker beer?</p></li>
<li><p>My equipment featured a 6 gallon plastic bucket and a 5 gallon glass carboy, should I prefer one over the other? Do I need to transfer to secondary fermenter after bubbles really slow down?   </p>

<ul>
<li>More specifically, the six gallon bucket I have has 5 gallons of liquid in it, which means it has a gallon of empty space, which is air, is this bad for the brew? Should I minimize the oxygen and just use the carboy?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I like my Weizens with a flavor and aroma of orange, kinda like Blue Moon or Shock Top. How does one achieve this? Do I add orange peel during boiling? or can I add it when transferring to secondary fermenter? Do I need to add anything else, like more yeast?</p></li>
<li><p>I have the feeling that I didn't completely sanitize all my equipment (Maybe I missed a spot while cleaning the bucket? maybe I'm just paranoid?) or that I might have been a little careless handling my equipment, will this ruin my brew?</p></li>

"Alternative/Non-traditional Brewing Practices","<p>Brew in a bag.<br>
No chill.<br>
Olive Oil aeration substitute.<br>
Overnight mashing.<br>
Batch Sparging. </p>

<p>The list continues.
These types of techniques are great and frequent areas of discussion in the home brewing forums and the like.  I also have no doubt that these techniques are making good drinkable beer.  I am sure brewers who use these types of techniques really enjoy their beer. Otherwise, they wouldn't really make it to daylight discussions.</p>

<p>But is anyone REALLY making world class beer?  I mean, has anyone seen or heard of competitions being WON by brewers using these techniques.  Or for that matter, even probrewers going these routes where possible.</p>

<p>For example, in Zymurgy magazine they publish the recipes and results of the National Homebrew Competition each year.  I find it interesting that in the years where they have included ""fermenter type"" in the recipe description, no one ever has ""in plastic bucket"" as a fermenter.  Either winning brewers are afraid to admit they use buckets or everyone making top notch beer really is using glass or stainless.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to take away from these techniques, just trying to make sense of the observation that by competition measures, I don't seem to see non-traditional techniques overtaking the more tradition 'time honored' brewing techniques.</p>

"Choosing a good refrigerator/freezer for kegerator conversion","<p>Does anyone have experience and recommendations for a good fridge/freezer for conversion into a kegerator?  I'm basically choosing between a full sized fridge, a mini-fridge and a chest freezer.  I'll likely start by using it just as a fridge for kegs and lagering and one day make the kegerator conversion.  My priorities are to be efficient, fit at least 2 5 gallon soda kegs, cost-effective and not completely unsightly.  Here is what I already know....</p>

<p>The full size fridge seems a little big for my needs, I live in an apt and would rather not have an additional full refrigerator/freezer.  I have no yard, garage or basement to stash it.  The advantage is they are abundant and cheap on craigslist (although most are not in great condition).</p>

<p>The mini fridge seems popular and there are some good conversion tutorials online.  Unfortunately when I go looking I rarely see any that would actually work.  Either they are very small or contain bulky freezer boxes or crispers that get in the way.</p>

<p>The chest freezer seem perfect, aside from being a freezer.  The inside is large and open and they are relatively cheap and compact.  I own a temperature controller but have never used it.  Will the constant turning on and off of the freezer damage the compressor?  How often should I expect it to flick on and off, is it annoying?  My fear is I'll go away and come back to find either the compressor died or the controller did and the beer is either warm or frozen solid.</p>

<p>Target OG was 1.055, mine came in at 1.050. After two weeks it went down to 1.019-1.020 (kind of on the line). Target FG for the recipe is 1.016. It got too cold at one point so I thought it might have stalled.</p>

<p>So I pitched another packet, waited a week and the gravity is as the same place. I didn't make a starter with the dry yeast, because there's a lot of yeast in a dry packet and it seemed like overkill for a 5 gal batch. </p>

<p>I'm guessing that I just have a lot of unfermentables in there which are bumping up the gravity. I added 1/2 lb of cocoa powder and maybe didn't have the best efficiency with my stove top partial mash which included oats. </p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.kegerators.com/carbonation-table.php"">this chart</a> from a link here that shows CO2 units by pressure &amp; temperature.</p>

<p>Once I've filled the keg, applied pressure as dictated by the desired carbonation level &amp; storage temperature, how long does it need to stay there for before I can pour beer after delicious beer?</p>

<p>Does it change based on temperature (e.g. am I better off with it in the fridge or ambient temp)?  That chart also mentions it is for ""slow force carbing"" - is there a quick force carbing method?</p>

<p>If you need to give an example, I'm after about 3-3.2 CO2 units in a 19L (5gal) batch and the beer is in the fridge (~40F).</p>

"How long should a Belgian Strong Dark Ale be aged?","<p>How long should a clone of Gulden Draak be aged before comparing it to the real stuff? Our club is trying to get our clone recipe as close as possible, so want to tweak the recipe to get it closer to Gulden Draak if there are significant differences. We want to minimize the chance that the differences are due to our clone being too ""green"" when we make the comparison. Also, should we age it longer in the carboy vs. in the bottles? The current plan is 14 days of primary, 14 days of secondary, then prime, bottle, and condition for 60-90 days.</p>

"Will Dry Hopping Add Bitterness?","<p>The prevailing wisdom seems to be that dry hopping is for aroma only, and effects on flavor are assumed to be a matter of perception. (i.e. smell affects taste)</p>

<p>However, while attempting to ""fix"" a beer that came out far too sweet, I have been looking into hop extracts, etc.  While researching I came across this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a chemical point of view, dry hopping will extract all of the alpha and beta acids in hops. The humulones, lupulones and other volatile oils are isomerized in the alcohol and water (the alcohol dues most of the extraction). Yes, more aroma and flavor will be extracted, but so will bitterness. We dry hop most of the time to add aroma to the beer, so most of the time we dry hop with low alpha acid ""aroma"" hops. Try dry hopping with Galena, Perle, Simcoe, Challenger, Northern Brewer or other high alpha acid hop. You will get the bitterness!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this true?  Will using high-alpha hops for dry hopping contribute bitterness?</p>

"Low original and final gravity","<p>My roommate and I brewed our first batch of beer, a Rogue Dead Guy clone (with some substitutions). The brew has finished secondary fermentation and our hydrometer reads 1.007 (temperature-adjusted). With an OG of 1.033 This gives our beer an ABV of around 3.4. While the beer itself tastes great, we were hoping for something a little stronger.</p>

<p>Here's the recipe we ended up using:
1 lb Cara-Munich
1 lb Munich
1/2 lb Crystal 40L
Steeped at 155 F for 30 minutes, then 1/2 gallon of water at 170 F was poured over the grain bag into pot. I think this is sparging, but I'm not sure :)</p>

<p>Added 4 lb Alexanders Pale LME, 4 lbs LDME. 1 oz Perle hops at 60 minutes, 1/3 oz Warrior at 30, 1/3 oz Warrior at 5, and 1/4 oz Saaz at 5.</p>

<p>The wort was cooled to 75 F and the yeast was pitched. We transferred to a carboy and filled it up to five-and-some-change gallons.</p>

<p>I have two questions. We realized later that the tap water we filled up with has a pH of 7.8 - is this too alkaline? Finally, is there anything we could do now to get fermentation started again (i.e., yeast energizers, shamanic chants, etc.)?</p>

"Pausing a ginger beer plant","<p>I am making ginger beer, the old fashioned way with a plant. The plant is a jamjar which I feed with one teaspoon of sugar and powdered ginger daily.</p>

<p>I'm going on holiday soon, for several weeks. I've been nurturing this plant for a couple of months and it's getting really nice, and I don't want to have to start again from scratch. What can I do to preserve it while I'm away?</p>

<p>I have access to a fridge (about 3ºC) and a freezer (about -10ºC). Given that the plant is a rather complex symbiotic mixture of yeast and bacteria, can I halt both their metabolism simply by putting it in the fridge? Can I freeze it without killing it off completely?</p>

<p>The other thing I'm worried about is that given that the plant lives at room temperature and covered only by a cloth, secondary infections are prevented partly by the sterilising effect of the ginger and ethanol, but mostly by the way that there's a hell of a lot of plant there and it's simply outcompeting any wild yeast or bacteria. If I damage the plant too much it won't be able to do this any more, and I run the risk of poisoning the plant.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> I'm not posting this as an answer become someone else already has that honour, but...</p>

<p>After forgetting about the one in the fridge for too long it went manky and I threw it away. However, I recently brought the one in the freezer out of cryosuspension, fed it up for a week, and bottled.</p>

<p>Turns out that freezing thoroughly kills a ginger beer plant. After a week and a half the bottles are totally failing to pressurise. And now one of the bottles is going mouldy on top (the mould is floating on the surface of the liquid). To me this suggests that the ethanol content isn't high enough to kill off the mould. So I reckon that's a total failure.</p>

<p>I think now I'm going to have to start again from scratch; which is a shame, as I was getting a really good flavour out of it. It may be possible to salvage some of that by recycling the liquid from the culture, but it's probably not worth the risk.</p>

"Saving head retention","<p>I have head retention problems in an extract bock, and I've been working my way through the potential issues. It's in a keezer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Line is 3/16, length is 8ft</li>
<li>Pressure is 14psi (I live at 5,000ft)</li>
<li>Pour time is 8-9 seconds</li>
<li>Fan circulates air</li>
<li>Keezer is 38F</li>
<li>Lines are coiled on top of keg, no CO2 breakout in the lines</li>
<li>I'm confident in the carbonation levels, it has been slow-carbing for months</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the beer hits the glass, the CO2 rapidly breaks out, forming glassy bubbles instead of white foam, and it sounds like a soda. A strong head of these glassy bubbles appears, but quickly dissipates leaving the beer completely flat.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've experimented with chilling the glasses, which helps but does not solve the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I've worked on ""beer clean glassware"", scrubbing with a brush &amp; baking soda/salt. They might not be ""beer clean"", but commercial beer has good head &amp; lacing in the same glasses vs my bock.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I'm thinking I must have some detergent traces in the beer- I used to clean my kettle and a few other elements for the boil with soap. I stopped a while ago, but there could still be residue.</p>

<p>Any ideas of other possible causes?</p>

<p>If it is detergent in the beer, is there anything I can do to save it?</p>

<p>P.S. I think I can rule out a CO2 leak in the gas side of the system, because my 5lb CO2 tank has been holding pressure for 3 months, and because the freezer is not full of CO2</p>

<p>Minor update: I got to thinking. I have a one-way check valve on the gas line. I began to wonder if it had a forward pressure (like a diode's forward voltage), i.e. the valve closes when the pressure across the valve is too low, resulting in a lower pressure on the other side of the valve. I swapped to an ordinary quick disconnect with no check valve, and some gas began flowing into the keg! So while the regulator was at 14psi, the keg was at something lower. Likely not much lower, but it was an interesting discovery. Does anyone know if there is a ""standard forward pressure"" for check valves?</p>

The directions are very thorough and precise (at least for a newbie's standards) but one thing that has me a little concerned is the boil temperature.</p>

<p>After steeping between 150&deg;F and 165&deg;F, they want me to increase the heat to bring the wort to a nice rolling boil.</p>

<p>I gave this a dry run last night with nothing more than a pot of water (I wanted to test the controls on my stove so I could map stove settings to temperature ranges...yes I'm a nerd). Water boils at 212&deg;F, and I was able to keep the water at a rolling boil for 55 minutes at 215&deg;F. But I then read that if (during the steeping) you let the water/wort get above 170&deg;F, the grain can leach tannins into the wort and ruin the taste.</p>

I'm running through a list of things that could I could have done wrong, and one of them <em>might</em> have been from when I racked the wort from the (cooled) brewpot into the plastic ""Ale Pale"" fermenter.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, I confirmed the wort was chilled down to 110&deg;F before I racked. And <em>yes</em>, I racked using a sanitized autosiphon, into a sanitized fermenter.

"How to troubleshoot for either bad wort or bad yeast?","<p>Brand new to brewing, 2.5 days ago I brewed my first extract kit (Brewer's Best Amber Ale) and racked it into my fermenter. By tomorrow morning I'll be at the 3 day (72 hours) milestone, which is what I've heard is the end of the ""everything is OK"" range; and still no bubbling activity in the airlock. And I don't expect there to be when I wake up tomorrow...I've checked and rechecked the seal w/ the plastic fermenter, and it appears to be solid.</p>

<p>If I wake up tomorrow and still don't see any bubbling, I would like to open up the lid and take a peek to see what's happening on the inside of the fermenter, but would like to know a few things before I go and expose my wort/beer/whatever-the-heck-it-is-at-this-point to the air:</p>

<li>If the wort is still good/salvageable, what can I do to kickstart/resurrect it? I'm out of yeast and the yeast I used was from the kit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things to help put this into context:</p>

<ul>
<li>All equipment was sanitized via Easy Clean</li>
<li>Wort was ~70&deg;F when I pitched the yeast</li>
<li>I let the yeast sit on the surface, untouched, for ~20 mins to rehydrate them</li>
<li>Then I stirred them into the wort <em>vigorously</em>, so as to distribute them and to help aerate the wort (did I kill them?)</li>
<li>The fermenter has been sitting in my dark, dry, cool (~65&deg;F) basement ever since I racked this past weekend</li>

"Temperature Control Issues","<p>I'm testing out a brand new 200L system and found a couple of potentially disastrous but potentially easy-to-fix issues:</p>

<p>1) While mashing the temperature indicated on the thermometer which sits near the bottom of the tun was fluctuating wildly between 60 and 70 degrees. It might go from 62 degrees to 70 degrees in a matter of seconds, then a few minutes later fall back down, even without any additional heat from the stove or from hot water additions. Other times when adding heat from the stove the temperature would remain in the low 60s. Obviously this is still in the desirable temperature range for mashing but means it's difficult to control the mash temperature for repeat recipes. There is a sight gauge with an inlet near the bottom and outlet at the top. The tun has no insulation, just a stove for heating/maintaining temperature.</p>

<p>Any ideas what could be going on? Some crazy convection current? At the moment I'm thinking my only option might be to get a jacket to insulate the tun once it's at the desired mash temperature. Anyone have any other suggestions?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wX7Qu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>2) My boil kettle is the same size, also with a sight gauge and thermometer near the bottom, as well as an in-place immersion cooler fixed inside. I found that after the boil I cooled for an hour and saw the temperature drop to 20 degrees so began filling the fermenters. However by the time I was drawing the last 3rd of the batch the temperature reading was back up to 50 degrees! Sadly, I didn't realise until I'd already aerated the wort in the fermenter :smack:.</p>

<p>My best guess is that the hot wort rose to the top and sank down to the bottom as I was gradually drawing it off. With less wort in contact with the immersion chiller it wasn't cooled properly. Should I carry on chilling for another hour? Or maybe draw the wort off in batches while continuing to chill? Or plump for a plate chiller?</p>

"Why would one batch of beer, brewed the same as the second, be more bitter?","<p>In fear of going into too much detail and yet not providing enough information to ascertain possible reasons;</p>

<p>Does anybody have any reasonable hypothesis as why one batch of beer would be more bitter than a second batch when re-produced exactly the same?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any answers as why this may happen?</p>

<p>The best information I can provide are my records.</p>

<p>It stands to reason there will be more questions of me before possible answers can be provided, and I'm happy to provide more information.</p>

<hr>

<p>reply dated 9/12/14</p>

<p>Firstly thank you to those who responded, I have lunched myself into exploring the information provided to isolate my possible reasons for this batch being higher in bitterness.</p>

<p>I do feel as I have failed to provide the correct information in order to portray my situation. I beg your forgiveness and have provided the TWO offending records.</p>

<p>Thus I will endeavour to provide more information and dismiss possible instances that could be causing the fault.</p>

<p>'To eliminate the variables will assist in finding my mistake'.</p>

<p>NOTE: I have now found out how to use OneNote and this should help to read my records.</p>

<p><strong>Batch #218 was in fact my best beer!</strong> - #218 did achieve a second place in the local show, thus my perseverance to reproduce it.</p>

<p>The problem batch is #220!</p>

<p>From my observations there are two note worthy differences between the batches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The addition of Gelatin to clarify the beer when kegging. Could this be the problem? - NOTE: I hope to disprove this issue once the bottled #220 ( that has no Gelatine ) has had sufficient time to carbonate - will update in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Not taking an accurate time in the first batch when the Cacao Nibs where added to the adjunct boil.( #220 notes where taken - 30min before the end of boil )
From memory # 218 had the Cacoa nibs added as late as 10 min before the end of the adjunct boil, but I can not be sure.  Could this be the problem?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The deciding factor to use Fining's in #220 was that #218 was 'cloudy' and did not present well when pouring a beer.</p>

<p>At the risk of lay it all out for everyone to see I have included my tasting notes. Some comments are brutally honest! - Please see the humour in them.</p>

<p>Might I add that procedurally I have developed what I consider a ridged set of procedures when brewing, my reasoning for this is to be able to reproduce a beer, and I have very successfully achieved this many times before.  But alas 'brewing is an art within the science'.</p>

<p>To answer some comments:</p>

<p>HOPS - To my knowledge the hops was of the same batch, only difference was the date utilising the hops from making #218 and #220 - less than a month. ( hops stored in air tight container in fridge)</p>

<p>WATER - All my brewing water is filtered, two stage down to Carbon 0.2 Micron.  I currently do not take PH readings as I have not ventured into Full Mash Brewing, YET!</p>

<p>Yeast - Both S04 Safale of the same vintage ( stored in fridge )</p>

<p>Skimming the krausen - I see the errors of my ways... but in my defence I only conduct this procedure prior to any hops being added.</p>

<p>FG - Well I do not have and answer to why the FG of #218 was so high ""1.019"" - Seeing as it was my first attempt at using the Cacao Nibs with an English Bitter I presumed the FG of 1.019 was due to the extra addition of the Nibs!?!?</p>

<p>The more I review my post I see many avenues that may contribute to my problem, but I hope someone else can see my glaring mistake!</p>

"Neglected to Cold Crash after fermentation","<p><strong>The Question</strong><br>
Will cold crashing after a beer is bottled (and waited 2 weeks for the carbonation) give you the same clarity as doing it in the fermenter prior to bottling (assuming you pour your beer carefully given the extra sediment that will exist)? Are there different rules to follow if you bottle cold crash vs fermenter cold crash?</p>

<p><strong>The Background:</strong><br>
I brewed an Irish Ale. Everything turned out great except I wish I tried cold crashing it prior to bottling. I haven't done it before and I am itching to find out how much impact cold crashing has relative to other practices to <a href=""http://byo.com/issues/item/486-conquer-chill-haze"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">combating chill haze</a></p>

<p>The beer is has good clarity (from what I can tell) at room temp but, of course, produces chill haze when refrigerated. I have done some experiments with almost freezing a bottle (carefully) and then refrigerating it.  Amazingly, within a day, the beer is noticeably clearer.</p>

<p>For the purposes of keeping the question directly on the <strong>Cold Crashing</strong> technique, I have produced a good rolling boil, used Irish moss, cooled wort down within 15 minutes using a counter flow chiller, primary fermented for 2 weeks, secondary for 3 weeks and no gelatin (since I would need to cold crash for it to work).</p>

<p><strong>The Disclaimer</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>I have seen this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/11390/cold-crashing-in-the-bottle"">post</a>

"Using a pump for brewing","<p>I'm getting a Chugger pump for Christmas. I have never used a pump in my brewing and I haven't yet bought the hardware and tubing so I have some questions. I do know that I need a ball valve on the pump outlet to control the flow.</p>

<p>1 - I would like to use hose barbs (without clamps) to quickly change the hoses that are connected to the pump. Will half-inch hose barbs and half-inch silicone tubing create enough of a seal to prevent leaks when the pump is creating pressure or do I need to get quick disconnects?</p>

<p>2 - If I do use quick disconnects, is there a preferred way to arrange the male and female connectors? Male on the pump and female on the hoses or female on the pump and male on the hoses or some other combination? I just wonder if there is any advantage to a particular arrangement.</p>

<p>3 - Since the pump inlet has to be below the liquid and the outlet will also be below the container I'll be pumping into, I assume that when the inflow runs out the hose on the outlet side will be full of liquid that can no longer be pushed along. Is that correct? If so, how do you handle disconnecting the hose without spilling the liquid?</p>

<p>4 - If I want to pump into a container that has a ball valve on it, is there any reason I can't attach the pump outlet hose to that ball valve and open it to pump the liquid in through the ball valve?</p>

<p>5 - Any other tips or recommendations?</p>

"Looking for process improvement suggestions","<p>I just did my 4th brew, my OG was lower than expected, and I'm looking for help with process improvements. I'm doing an all grain process. I have an 8gal kettle, a 2gal kettle, and a 0.5gal kettle. For the mash tun I have a 10gal home depot converted cooler with ball valve control spigot. </p>

<p>My process is as such:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Day before - fill the kettles with water, let them sit 24 hours with a Campden tablet shared between the pots. </p></li>
<li><p>Heat 6.5gal of water in the 8-gal kettle to 160F. Warm the mash tun, check the water is still 160F.</p></li>
<li>Dump the grain into the mash tun, </li>
<li>Tip the 6.5gal of 160F water into the mash tun. Actually this starts out by moving it 1 quart at a time as I'm unable to safely dump the entire 6.5 gal of hot water in one shot anyway, and I heard it was better to add it slowly to the dry grain. </li>
<li>Stir with my giant 24"" spoon to check no air pockets  (just at the start)</li>
<li>Then leave for an hour. (temp remains constant for the hour within 150-155F - typically around 152F)</li>
<li>Recirculate until the flow of wort is relatively clear</li>
<li><p>Drain until empty back into the 8 gallon kettle - this typically yields about 4.2 gal. </p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile I've heated the 2 gal kettle and 1/2 gal kettle to 170F</p></li>
<li>Dump 2.5gal of 170F water into the mash tun to sparge</li>
<li>Stir briefly</li>
<li>Wait 15 minutes</li>
<li>Recirculate until flow of wort is relatively clear</li>
<li><p>Add this to the kettle until the kettle is back up to the 6.5gal mark</p></li>
<li><p>Boil for an hour adding hops and Irish moss as prescribed</p></li>
<li>45 minutes into the boil add the wort chiller to sanitize it (no water flow connected).</li>
<li>Transfer to the sink, connect the water flow to the chiller, also add blocks of ice into the sink</li>
<li>Stir the wort with the chiller and drop the temperature down to 70-75F</li>
<li>Siphon to 6.5 gal better bottle</li>
<li>Test OG - this is usually done with the final, rather trubby, bit of the wort. </li>
<li>Pitch yeast</li>
<li>Wait until airlock starts to bubble, then chill to prescribed fermentation temp in a temp controlled modified-freezer.  </li>
</ol>

<p>My recipe involved 11 lbs of grain for a pilsner, with an expected OG of 1.049 mine measured 1.044, so a little lower than expected. My previous brew called for an expected OG of 1.062 but my process only yielded 1.051 so lower still. </p>

<p>I'm wondering - are my OG's lower because I'm using a higher volume (6.5gal for the boil) than a typical recipe expects?</p>

<p>Specifically, with a 5gal recipe - what exactly is supposed to be 5gal? The pre boil volume, the post boil including trub volume, the volume initially put into the fermenter without the trub, or the bottled volume? I've been trying to target 5gals into the bottles, my last round yielded 4.66gal. But perhaps this is my misunderstanding and might completely explain my OG delta?</p>

<p>MANY thanks for reading this long one!</p>

"Left bottles in car overnight - am I screwed?","<p>Last night I bottled an extract kit with a friend, divided bottles, drove home, and left them in the car overnight 6pm to 6am. It got down to 5 degrees F, but the beer did not get cold enough to freeze. </p>

It was a fairly big beer (1.070) with US-05.</p>

"Off-flavour after carbonation","<p>I tasted the beer when it came out of the fermenter and it was great. I cooled it to 4 degrees then I racked it into the keg and force carbonated - about 1 minute at 300kPa, a good few minutes of vigorous shaking later it dropped to 140kPa so left it for an hour. I then tapped the keg and it was all foam - very overcarbonated... my regulator is a bit dodgy so will go for less CO2 next time.</p>

<p>The thing is, when I tried the beer after the foam settled the flavour was completely different - very astringent, almost plastic-like, flavour. This is the first time I've use the lines and the CO2 cannister.</p>

<p>What could the off-flavour be caused by? Could it be bad gas? Or bad lines (heat-resistant PVC, only about 30cm long)? Would chlorine in the water be doing something bad with the CO2? Or just the fact that it's over-carbonated so there's excess carbonic acid?</p>

<p>Also, is there any way to resolve the situation? I guess just periodically release the CO2 from the head space to solve the over-carbonation issue, but is that also likely to resolve the flavour issue?</p>

<li>Magnesium - 18</li>
<li>Sodium - 2</li>
<li>Carbonate - 180</li>
<li>Sulfate - 120</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is it appropriate for me to conclude that Munich's/Bavaria's water is that which I should use to make a bavarian hefeweizen?</strong></p>

  <p>[Shifts] in zymo-demographics in Europe, along with the craft beer revolution in America, have shaped a wheat beer landscape that is quite different in the late twentieth century than it was even ten years earlier. (pg. 343)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't find the page right now, but he also states that back in the old days, wheat beers in Germany were made with only 1/3 wheat and 2/3 barely, which is nearly the opposite today.</p>

Been fermenting at a pretty consistent 20C (with one drop to about 17C for a few hours) and once or twice popping to 22C.
I was pretty vigorous with how I mixed the wort initially - I shook and shook the fermenter. If anything, I'm worried I overdid it, because there was a lot of foam etc. (Is this normal? Did I mess up?)</p>

<p>Anyway, how concerned should I be by the unexpected gravity readings? With a higher FG like this, should I wait longer, or bottle? (Concerned about it continuing to ferment, and then bottling, causing bottle bombs... am I mistaken?)</p>

a) I've been using the hydrometer correction calculation incorrectly (not knowing what the hydrometer is calibrated to)<br>
b) I somehow added more water??? (this one worries me though, because I was <em>very</em> precise according to the markings on the carboy - I'm now wondering whether the carboy, which I got from a local DIY brew shop, was incorrectly marked?)<br>
c) I stalled the yeast a little (although again, the temperature drop happened in the middle of the fermentation, and there was definitely further activity and SG drop for a few days afterwards?)</p>

"How to prevent solventy/overly alcoholic flavors?","<p>I'm a moderately experienced homebrewer, and recently I've been making a lot of imperial stouts--variations on the same recipe, hoping to dial it in. Decently strong ones: my OG is usually around 1.111, and I finish between 1.030 and 1.037 (I'm aiming for a sweeter stout, so that's fine). I pitch 2 rehydrated packs of Safale S-04 (new) per 5 gallon batch. I primary until it's done fermenting actively, transfer to a keg for secondary, and let it age for 1-2 months before crashing in the cooler.</p>

<p>However, I have a persistent alcoholic/solventy flavor when I first try the beers. This has happened 3 times now. Really hits you in the back of the nose when you sip/inhale over the beer. The rest of the flavors are fine; no weird yeast making nasty tastes.</p>

<p>I know that this is typically a fermentation temperature issue, but the odd thing is that, if anything, most of these beers ferment a little low (I have a poorly heated room for fermentation in the winter, so even with a water bath, the temps tend to stick between 58F and 63F).</p>

<p>What could be causing these alcoholic/solventy flavors? Should I lower the primary temperature still more?</p>

<p>Also, I've been taking the beer out of the water bath when it's done with primary and letting it secondary in the air.

Could this be when/where the off flavor develops?</p>

Alternatively, is this a typical ""young beer"" problem with strong stouts, and one that will fade with time?</p>

<li>There is no layer of krausen on the top of the fermenter. Is this normal/expected in some cases? Because of this, should I re-pitch yeast into the primary fermentation?</li>
<li>My original gravity reading prior to fermentation was 1.020. The recipe sheet mentions  an SG of 1.058-1.060 - so was something wrong to begin with with this batch of beer?</li>
<li>The reading on my hydrometer today is 1.010, which is within the range of the  expected final gravity on the recipe sheet.</li>

<p>My question is: given proper-to-over pitch rates, cold-pitching (to minimize acetaldehyde/diacetyl production and precursors), and careful monitoring of fermentation temperature, is there any practical reason that homebrewers cannot turn beers around quickly, like in a commercial brewery?  Is it diastatic pressure?  </p>

<p>For instance, I made a California Common last fall, and was just below a lager pitch rate for a 5G batch.  Pitched at 60*, fermented there for 4 days, fermented 4 more days raising up slowly (2-3*/day) to 70*, cold-crashed for 12 hours, gelatin, racked, quick-carbed and served.  And it was great.  </p>

<p>I'm not saying I didn't get lucky on the above-batch, but for any beer below say 6% alcohol, I would love some information on what is happening to the beer after FG is reached.  </p>

"Well carbonated, but no head","<p>I've tried looking for duplicates to this question, but can't quite find a single question that covers it, so here goes (pls let me know if I've missed one)</p>

<p>Last night I tasted the first bottle of my first ever homebrew! It was just an extract kit (Coopers Real Ale), and I was quite pleased by it. The only thing that surprised me was the complete lack of head when I poured the beer. The beer was carbonated, at least reasonably I thought, and tasted good (I think), so at the moment all I can think of is that the glass was the problem. (Brand new beer glasses, but washed in the dishwasher.... could the rinse aid be the culprit?)
I only bottled a week ago (so 6 days conditioning before I opened), but like I say, the carbonation seemed good to me. </p>

<p>Is there something else that might have caused this?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the advice so far, going to wait a little longer and see if further conditioning sorts me out...<br>
Bottle #2: cleaned a glass by hand, and bottle had an extra 2 days conditioning, and I may have ""cheated"" and poured a little more vigorously :) Muuuuch better head, not much retention, but certainly no worse than the local mass-produced lagers. Holding thumbs for bottle #3...</p>

"How to make more beer than I can boil?","<p>I will soon need to buy some more equipment, but I want to think it a little bit what I really need to buy and in the meantime I will try some workaround.</p>

<p>I was thinking of brewing mash/extract recipes, so my idea was (for a 1.050OG beer, 10l volume):</p>

<ol>
<li>Mash at a ""normal"" OG around 1.050s</li>
<li>Boil th wort for 45 minutes (5l of wort more or less)</li>
<li>Add the malt extract for the last 15 minutes (to achieve almost double gravity, let's say 1.100)</li>
<li>Dilute high gravity wort with 5 more liters to get final volume of 10 litres.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bitterness extraction could be different (but I will assume effect is negligible).</p>

<p>My real question is, will it be a bad idea to mix malt extract toward the end of the boil? Will I get bad flavors from shortly boiled extract?</p>

<p>Any other possible issue, or maybe a better method for that?</p>

I am thinking about going standard 2ish weeks in the bucket then transferring to carboy to ride out the remaining 90ish days. Am I daft for thinking 105 days of primary seems odd?

"Can you mash for too long?","<p>I'm looking at brewing an all-grain barley wine in the near future, and I'm aiming for a high ABV (13%-14% ABV).  From what I've heard in discussions elsewhere, by single-infusion mashing at a lower temperature (I'm shooting for 148 for about 90 minutes), I am extracting more fermentable sugars and achieving a dryer taste (both of which I want for this style ale).  What are the less than desirable qualities in a barley wine that I will suffer as a consequence for mashing at the lower end of the scale?  I'm mashing for 90 minutes instead of the typical 60 to try and guarantee I get the pre-boil gravity I'd like, but is 90 minutes excessive?  Is there such a thing as mashing for too long?

<p>The plan is to heat the cider in a big pot to the right temperature (say, 70C), pour a little into the demi to let it adjust, then fill it up. I might need some sort of heat source to keep it warm, but I won't have power. I'm thinking about a very low gas flame with a lot of diffusion (fine metal screens) underneath the demi. Then again, 20L of hot liquid stays hot a long time, maybe I won't need to worry.</p>

"Dropped the temperature as it was getting out of control, did I shock my yeast?","<p>Making an IPA with an OG of 1.069, we pitched at 70°F with good ol' Safale US-05, just dry out of the packet as I've always done with US-05 with good success (I tend to trust it a little too much perhaps). Should have rehydrated probably, but eh, the yeasties got into the bucket. This is my 6th brew so by no means am I an expert.</p>

<p>Day 1 was fine: no activity until the afternoon (T+18h) when it started bubbling lightly as expected.</p>

<p>Night of Day 1 (T+24h - 36h) my roommate (who I brew with and should know better ;)) turned off the A/C in the apartment, so ambient temps rose to about 76°. I checked the temp and the fermenter reached 81°... yikes (IR thermometer and stuck-to-side-of-fermenter thermometer agreed). Bubbler was still going crazy at about 1/second, so I'm guessing that fermentation just took off overnight.</p>

<p>I didn't want the temps up there, so I made a water bath in a rubbermaid bin, with about 68° water, and stuck the fermenter in (submerged about halfway up the bucket). Temps equalized very slowly over about 6 hours and finally stabilized at 72°, which to me seems perfect for this yeast, still even a little high but (I hope) better than it was.</p>

<p>Day 3 and 4 now bubbling slowed and then stopped completely. I haven't opened the lid to check krausen or take a gravity reading yet.</p>

<p>Questions in convenient numbered form:</p>

<ol>
<li>Could dropping the temperature from that 80° point down to 72° in about 6 hours have ""shocked"" the yeast in some way?</li>
<li>Is this just the US-05 going through all the sugars in one night like the good little workhorse it is? Only a gravity reading will tell...</li>
<li>Would it be worth re-pitching in case something bad did happen?</li>

"Fruit Flies in Airlock. How can I Test if Mead is Okay?","<p><strong>In short</strong> <br />After approximately 5.5 month my airlock full of vodka has lost 60% of its volume and now has trapped a couple dozen of fruit flies.  Should I be concerned for my batch of Mead?</p>

<p>What methods can I use to test the mead (taste and smell)? Is this common and preventable? </p>

<p><strong>In depth</strong> <br/>
Last November 25th I started my first 5-gallon batch of Joes Ancient Orange Mead following the recipe here: <a href=""http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f80/joes-ancient-orange-mead-49106/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f80/joes-ancient-orange-mead-49106/</a> (multiplying most ingredients by five save for the yeast and the cloves).   </p>

<p>I believe everything went well. The airlock was furiously bubbling for a time and continued to bubble for many days after. However, after the initial few days I added more water to the carboy (as described in the directions) and believe I may have damaged the airlock. I cannot say how as the airlock appeared to still work though I did hear a loud pop when I returned it to the bung/stopper. </p>

<p>As directed I did not touch the carboy for months. My aim has been to wait six months (which will be in 14 days) before attempting to bottle (regardless the fruit still has not dropped, but that is another matter). In the last week I noticed a discoloration of the air lock. I have caught some fruit flies! </p>

"The ""correct"" step to add cinnamon and vanilla?","<p>I want to experiment a bit by adding spices - I'm thinking <code>cinnamon</code> and <code>vanilla</code> - to my beer, but wonder at which step is considered the best time to add it.  Personal experience is very welcome.</p>

<p>I assume adding it during mashing is out...  I guess the obvious time would be during the boil (in ""tea""-bags?) - but early or late?  Or is it better to do it after the boil - during ""mixing"" - just to let the spices soak?  (I guess it's a bad idea to leave spices in during (1st) fermentation...)  Or is it best to wait until 2nd fermentation, using the step pretty much just to add the spices?  Or should I perhaps make an extract or tea with warm/boiling water, or an infusion in alcohol (vodka)... if so, how - and when should I add this extract?</p>

<p>Will one extract more ""taste"" and the other more aroma (smell)?  Will one be stronger and the other subtler?  Will one be more ""in your face"" and the other more mellowed/aged?</p>

<p>I'm thinking about using cinnamon-bark and vanilla-""sticks"" (dried fruits).  I'll probably add some honey (during the boil(?)) too...</p>

<p>PS:  Should I leave the vanilla-""stick"" whole, or do what one often do in cooking - split it lengthwise and scrape out the seeds inside, before putting it all (seeds and split ""stick"") into what I want to set taste too?  The seeds are tiny black ""dots"" - and it probably won't be that many of them in the whole batch - but still, it's perhaps nothing you want to see in your beer (looks just delicious in hot chocolate though ;-)...</p>

"Cell growth factors in different types of yeast starter","<p>Cell growth in a yeast starter is dependent on the volume of starter wort. Palmer states that as a general rule of thumb, a 1 liter starter roughly doubles the cell count while a 3 liter starter about triples it.</p>

<p>Other than the fact that Zainashef cites  slightly different figures, I believe that Palmer's rule is an oversimplification. The Mr. Malty calculator distinguishes between a simple starter, an oxygenated simple starter, an intermittently shaken starter, a continuously aerated starter and a stir plate.</p>

<p>However, the tab that selects these options doesn't seem to do anything (at least not on my 'puter). I'm also not sure how Mr. Malty deals with inoculation rates.</p>

"Beer has off flavor, sample taken while bottling tasted good","<p>I brewed an IPA about 3 weeks ago. Everything went fine during fermentation and I've dropped a couple of hop pellets 4 days before bottling into the fermenter as I planned to do.</p>

<p>I've put the sample into the fridge (after measuring the FG) and drank it after 3 days, it tasted good! I decided to put a couple of bottles into the fridge, and when taking them out of the closet they were in I saw the following ""dust"" swimming inside the beer (picture at the end of post).</p>

<p>When tasting the beer it lost its juicy taste that the sample had and it looks a bit darker. From my experience I would say it has this ""old"" IPA taste and sugary/caramel smell.</p>

"What happens to artificial sweeteners in wine?","<p>It's basic knowledge that alcoholic beverages are made by letting the yeast eat sugar and poop out alcoholic and carbon-dioxide, in a process known as fermentation. And since sugar only means sucrose, glucose, maltose and similar organic chemicals, it is a no-brainer that artificial sweeteners won't work.</p>

<p>This is why I had an idea. Since I'm an amateur who lacks professional brewing equipment, I cannot always be certain that the yeast is really dead after I pasteurize my wines. So adding sugar post-fermentation to the wine isn't very smart, since if I botched the pasteurization and failed to kill the yeast, I may trigger fermentation again. So I thought - why not add artificial sweeteners PRIOR to fermentation <em>(in addition to the normal sugar, off course)</em>? If the artificial sweetener is unfermentable, it'll work, right?</p>

<p>The sweetener I had in mind was Süssina's artificial sweetener, whose chemical composition is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maltodextrin</li>
<li>Sodium saccharinate</li>
<li>Sodium cyclamate</li>
<li>Sodium bicarbonate</li>
<li>Monosodium citrate</li>

<p>The question is, will adding all this to the wine prior to fermentation prevent/hijack fermentation? After all, all this sodium... But what about adding it post-fermentation? Are these chemicals unfermentable?</p>

First one is 0.34 B cells/ml in 6 liters of wort starter with just a few amount of slurry cake.
2nd one is 1.46 B cells/ml in 1 liter of starter including Wort+Slurry.</p>

<p>So when it comes to total number of yeast cell calculation,do i need to multiply yeast count with 6 liters of wort or a thin layer of slurry which is 300 ml ??</p>

"How to increase thickness in beer?","<p>I've found myself becoming quite fond of ""thick"" and ""juicy"" IPAs and DIPAs. Beers with a viscosity to them that feels somewhat syrupy and leaving a great mouthfeel when drunk.</p>

<p><strong>What techniques are there to brewing thick beers?</strong></p>

<p>Does it come down to the malt bill, the ratio of grist to water in the mash, the hops, boil time, adding lactose or some other additive? Do they all affect it?</p>

"Unfermented Wine - What to do?","<p>I had a real problem with this years Zinfandel.  It got delivered at 29 brix which I think is the source of the problem.  I added 13% water to try to get it down around 25 brix at the 72 hour mark after pitching yeast on day one.</p>

<p>It fermented its way down to 2 brix.  I tried 3-4 different yeast starters (apple juice, highly effective yeasts, space heaters, etc) to get it down to fully dry, but none of it worked.</p>

<p>Now it's 9 months later after fermentation and I have a lot of 2 brix wine.  It is <em>very</em> sweet to the taste.  I don't have access to other dry wine to blend with in this quantity.  So what should I do? Are there any other products I could try to alter this into?  Port? Sherry?</p>

<p>Does anybody have any experience in really under-fermented wine?  I would love to hear what you did and how it turned out.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Further Information</strong>
The comments below were asking about my yeast selection.  So here's more info.  Initially, I used a blend of BM45 and BDX yeast.  Towards the end of fermentation, when it was really slowing down.  I did my first yeast starter.  I used 60g of Uvaferm 43 and followed this <a href=""http://blog.eckraus.com/making-a-wine-yeast-starter-to-restart-a-stuck-fermentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eckraus</a> tutorial.  Basically, I took a small amount of must, added water and sugar, and poured them in the main jugs after 24 hours.  </p>

<p>After that didn't work, a couple weeks later, I did another yeast starter.  I pitched another 60g of Uvaferm 43 into 1 gallon of store-bought apple juice and added and additional 30% water.  At the 12 hour mark. I added another 30% of the wine.  Then at the 24 hour mark, I added all that back into the main jugs of wine.</p>

<p>None of that worked.  You can read the whole story on my journal blog <a href=""http://thirstyvine.com/2017-vintage-zinfandel/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  It's now 9 months later and I need to bottle soon.  Can I still do a yeast restart?  Any reason to think that doing it again would work on the third try?</p>

"What is necessary to keep yeast happy and healthy?","<p>If you take left over yeast from a wash and dump it in new mash, and repeat, eventually the yeast stop reproducing due to extensive budding scars. So after 4-12 batches people buy new yeast... if not right away. But I was just thinking, why is that so different from sour dough? Bakers can keep thier yeast alive indefinitely by feeding them flour when they are hungry. And if you think about it logically yeast have to be able to reproduce indefinitely, otherwise there wouldn't be any yeast. They would have gone extinct in weeks if they could only handle several batches.. I think they only excessively reproduce by budding under the harsh circumstances brewing beer. But I wasn't able to find that specific information online, nor what it is about brewing beer specifically that kills them. I'm wondering if they can mitigate budding damage by reproducing normally. And I wonder if to get more out of a line of yeast one could do some simple tricks like instead of tossing them straight from one mash to the next, put them into dough in between?</p>

"Failed primary fementation - repitch?","<p>Yeast: <strong>Mangrove Jack's M44 - US West Coast</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I brewed an IPA recipe but had a couple of issues when it came to pitching the yeast.</p>

<p>The first was that I could not get the wort temperature below 23.9ºC (75F).</p>

<p>The second was that I cooled the re-hydrated yeast too far, to 19.1ºC (66F), as I expected to get the wort down to 21ºC-ish (70F). When I could not get the wort temperature any lower, after using the chiller for almost an hour, I decided to warm the yeast up slightly to 21-22ºC (70-72F) so I could pitch at a slightly higher than normal temperature. Mistakenly I warmed the yeast far too quick by placing the re-hydrated container of yeast in a saucepan of water on the hob. In the space of 10-15 seconds it warmed from 19.1ºC (66F) to 22.3ºC (72F).</p>

<p>At pitching the temps were:<br>
Wort - 23.7ºC (75F)<br>
Yeast - 22.3ºC (72F)</p>

<p>18 hours later the bucket appears to be doing nothing. The airlock is inactive and the lid is not even bulging slightly to indicate a build up of pressure. I have ordered another sachet of M44 yeast which will hopefully arrive tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is the higher than optimum pitching temperature likely to delay the start of the primary fermentation?  </li>
<li>Will the temperature shock of quickly warming the yeast by 3.2ºC (5F) in 10-15 seconds have likely damaged the yeast?  </li>
<li>How long should I wait before determining whether I should pitch the additional yeast?  </li>
<li>If I pitch another sachet of yeast will there be any effects on the end flavour? </li>

I picked up a <a href=""http://www.midwestsupplies.com/summit-avenue-ale-clone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""Summit Avenue EPA""</a> clone of Summit EPA from Midwest Supplies. </p>

<p>On Monday I did the 60 minute boil, cooled everthing to about 75 degrees F and pitched the yeast. Took a hydrometer reading and got an adjusted SG of 1.031 which seemed a bit low. I moved the plastic bucket with the lid on and the fermentation lock on into the basement which is usually around 65 degrees. Tuesday I checked on it and saw the lock bubbling happily with a bubble every 2 to 3 seconds. On Wednesday I checked again and there were no bubbles at all in over a minute. I decided to leave it for an extra day and see if it worked itself out. Wednesday night I checked again and saw no bubbles for the 2nd straight day. I decided to move the bucket upstairs into a closet where the temperature is a bit higher. </p>

<p>This morning there are still no bubbles and I'm starting to get worried - is there anything I should do to kick start the fermentation (make a new starter and pitch new yeast?) or should I just let it go for a few more days and see what happens? Also is it bad to take the lid off and get a new hydrometer reading this early in the fermentation process?</p>

"Safe/practical to leave brew equipment in no-rinse sanitation tub throughout the whole brew?","<p>I'm brand new to brewing and am just using extract kits.</p>

<p>I got my haircut recently, and it gave me an idea for brewing (!). The barber keeps his scissors in a little trough full of that blue barbicide. Throughout the day, customer after customer, he never cleans or washes the scissors by scrubbing them manually. He puts the scissors into the barbicide every time he's done using them. And when he needs them again, he pulls them out of the barbicide and uses them immediately on the customer.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if this translates to keeping brew equipment/utensils santized. My extract brews are taking a few hours from start to finish, and I am constantly setting utensils (mash paddles, measuring cups, whatever) down on a clean surface, but then feel the need to re-sanitize them every time I need them again.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if I can just make a big tub of sanitized solution (I've been using no-rinse <strong>Easy Clean</strong>), once, at the beginning of my brew session, and then just use it (like the barbicide) to keep my utensils sanitary? That way I can just use them as-is (since its no-rinse) when I need them, and then throw them back into the vat-o-sanitation when I'm done with them (for the moment).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With malted wheat being the exception since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If its long proteins are not broken up in the mash, they clump together and fall out of the beer rather than staying and providing an attractive haze. So, it is beneficial to use a protein rest in any beer with more than about 15% wheat in the grist.""</p>

"Not enough yeast for a 20 Litre batch?","<p>Gday! :) So i have just purchased the coopers real ale malt concentrate as well as a kilo of light malt. I started with 2 litre's of boiled water in my fermentor (after sanitising it with no rinse sanitiser) and added the coopers extract as well as the malt. gave a good stir. I then added filtered cold water to the 20 litre mark and then added boiled water and cold filtered water until i got to 23 litres and the desired temperature range of 28 degrees Celsius. I then added the brewing yeast at 28 degrees. My first question is. Was this too hot too add the yeast and have i shocked/killed it? secondly it only came with 7 grams of yeast, Is this enough for 23 litres of wort? The yeast seemed to disappear when i added it and a yeast'y smell was present. Another question i have is because the fermentor is in my garage, in a few hours it has dropped temperature slowly to around 24-26. So i now have put it in the kitchen hopefully keeping it at that temp. What temp will the yeast stop working? Also with the fermentor valve. I put just filtered water inside it. It wasn't sure if i used no rinse sanitised water or not. Thanks for the help!!!! :)</p>

I am excited so start this one up.  It takes a long time but the idea of making my own imperial stout is very exciting to me.  </p>

<p>This will only be my third brew, my others were much quicker.  I have only done a Double IPA and a Coffee Porter, both were LME kits like this one.</p>

<p>So I have read that many people try not to use the mail order yeast that comes with these kits because it could have gotten damaged waiting on the doorstep or in the truck.  And there was a comment on the yeast being used may not have had the length of life to fully ferment all the sugars in this big burly stout.</p>

<p>My plan is to got from chilled wort right into a glass carboy for the duration of its fermentation.  I just got a blow off tube that I plan to use on this brew just in case.</p>

<p>I am concerned about using Safale-5 yeast (which is what I expect to see when the package arrives).  <strong>Should I use a little extra?  Perhaps there is a better product to use?</strong>  The first taste is at 12 weeks, so I don't want this to go bad.  I bought an extra carboy just for this one.  It will be a nice winter stash if it goes well.</p>

<p>I boiled a pot of water and soaked a mason jar in it. I then boiled another pot of water and put that aside to cool.</p>

<p>I bought some fresh organic ginger root and tried using a cheese grater. It got mushy so I sliced up the rest of what I needed. I tried to make it small chunks.</p>

<p>When the water was fairly cool (cozy enough for bacteria) I tossed in the ginger, granulated white sugar, and the water. I assumed boiling would get rid of the chlorine etc.</p>

<p>I mixed with a wooden spoon and re-attached the mason lid with a coffee filter instead of the metal top.</p>

<p>I kept the rest of the ginger (I bought waaaay too much) in the fridge, as I figured the bacteria would likely live.</p>

<p>Daily I took some out, cut it up, added 1 tablespoon of ginger and white granulated sugar.</p>

<p>After a few days I started keeping it behind my PS4 as it is on almost all day, and it puts off a good amount of heat.</p>

"Bottle Bomb Mayhem","<p>My fiancee and I have taken the massive undertaking of brewing as much beer for our wedding as we can, and it's been a really fun project- thus far. We've brewed numerous batches successfully, yet our most recent batches have caused us a lot of frustration.</p>

<p>We made some delicious pumpkin ales, and stored them in a rubber container, and after a few weeks they started exploding. We were actually moving from one apartment to another, and I guess the commotion built up some pressure in the bottles. In any case, our bottles that had been quiet for 6 weeks started exploding- 1 by 1- 5 of them over the course of as many hours. </p>

<p>We cleaned off the surviving bottles, refrigerated them until they calmed down, and waited a day or two before attempting to degas them. I assume that with all the sediment that we lost in the secondary (aprx. 1 gallon), the standard 5 ounces of priming sugar from our kit was too much for our reduced volume beer. Anyways, I degassed the bottles, (easing out excess gas, then tightening again), and thought the problem was solved. </p>

<p>I then put the old pumpkin beers in a 3 month old bin of octoberfests that had never had a problem. Another pumpkin beer had exploded, covering my Octoberfests. I stupidly waited 48 hours since I was so exhausted from all the other chores of moving, before cleaning up the mess in the rubber container. After rinsing off the surviving pumpkin ales, and the octoberfests, I realized that the caps (custom made- grog tag.com) were beginning to show a bit of rust. Right after finishing cleaning the old bottles, an Octoberfest exploded into oblivion 6 feet away from me. Fortunately, I was fine.... But now I'm trying to figure out how this pumpkin ale chaos has affected my perfectly fine Octoberfests... I assume that my caps had corroded, and in the 48 hours I left them untouched, an infection ocurred that built up the pressure in the Octoberfests. </p>

<p>It's like a zombie appocolypse- my bad beers are now affecting my good ones! </p>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<p>1.) What are your thoughts on my theory about the original cause of the exploding? Using 5 ounces of sugar on 4 gallons of beer before bottling (again, this is due to the reduced volume from the high sediment). Should I use less sugar for the reduced volume? Should I add water to the beer to bring it up to 5 gallons again? For the record, we used the hydrometer and confirmed fermentation was done before bottling.</p>

<p>2.) Are the octoberfests exploding from the pressure increasing in the storage container as they explode one by one? Or are the octoberfests exploding from infection due to rusted caps? </p>

<p>In any case, I created an account here moments after this debacle occured with the octoberfests, and before finishing this post- another exploded in the container. I think I'm tossing this whole batch, for safety. But I don't want this to happen again. Beware of zombies. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

"Aerating no chill corny keg fermentors that don't seal","<p>I'm very interested in ferment in corny-kegs after <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9352/how-can-i-ferment-in-a-corny-keg-under-constant-pressure/9361#9361"">reading</a> some <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9750/what-are-the-benefits-of-fermenting-under-pressure"">questions</a> about <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/1287/corny-keg-fermentors"">that</a> here on this stackexchange. I will try it next batch, but there is a question about aeration/no chilling method:</p>

<p>Normally I aerate my wort by splashing it when transfering from my no chill vessels to my fermentors, so I understand that I am mixing my wort to the air and all the microorganisms around when I'm doing that. Before splash I put my yeast in the bottom of the fermentor and the same movement mix them to wort to.</p>

<p>Now I want to No Chill and ferment in the same kegs. Is it possible? How to properly aerate the wort doing this way?
I know that I can simple shake the kegs to aerate them, but these kegs don't seal if they're not pressurized. So it will be a big mess to clean if I need to do that way. And a O2 tank is not a possibility for now.</p>

<p>So I want to know if I can:</p>

<p>1) Fill the kegs and seal them with CO2 to No Chill;</p>

<p>2) Pitch my yeast directly in these cornys after chilled, put some CO2 to seal it, shake it to mix the yeast to the wort;</p>

<p>3) Remove the gas in post to hook a hose as a blowoff tube, <a href=""http://www.northernbrewer.com/connect/2010/03/how-to-make-a-bicycle-pump-keg-dispensor/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plug a bicycle pump</a> in my liquid-out disconnect to aerate the wort.</p>

<p>This protocol seems good? There is a better/safer way to do that? It will be better if I use the same HDPE vessels for no chill and splash it to the cornys? A bike pump is better/worse than a aquarium air pump or should I expect similar results?
I've been reading a post about aeration and <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/2690/wort-aeration-on-a-budget/2736#2736"">this answer</a> caught my attention.

"Does bottling conditioning change the nature of the carbonation?","<p>There's a common opinion that bottle conditioning yields carbonation that is qualitatively different from what's produced by force carbonation. Typically, it is claimed that bottle conditioning produces finer/smaller bubbles, the head lasts longer, the lacing is more prominent etc.</p>

<p>For instance, consider this, from the <a href=""http://thankheavenforbeer.com/2010/03/22/natural-carbonation-vs-forced-carbonation/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thank Heaven For Beer</a> blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The beer carbonated ye old naturale method has a thin layer of yeast
  on the bottom.  The head is thicker and more billowy with more peaks
  and valleys, and it has longer retention with more lacing.  There are
  fewer bubbles sticking to the glass (both dishwasher cleaned) and the
  bubbles are tinier.  In the mouth, the beer feels smoother than the
  force carbonated beer, and more effervescent; perhaps more champagne
  like, though both feel as they have the same level of carbonation. 
  The beer that was carbonated induces more belching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also heard this claim made about Champagne, which is traditionally bottle conditioned, while lower-priced bottles are force carbonated.</p>

<p>My education in chemistry stopped at grade 11, so I could be getting some things fundamentally wrong, but I don't understand how the process by which the CO<sub>2</sub> is produced could affect the quality of the carbonation. As I understand it, CO<sub>2</sub> exists in equilibrium with water (or beer), mediated by temperature and pressure. The lower the temperature and the higher the pressure, the more CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved (as carbonic acid) in the liquid. Whether the CO2 is produced by yeast consuming sugars, or supplied by a CO<sub>2</sub> tank, I can't image that the chemistry is any different.</p>

<p>In the above passage, all the qualities attributed to natural conditioning could also be the result of slightly higher level of carbonation compared with the force carbonated beer.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to these claims about bottling conditioning vs. force carbonation? Or is this an old wive's tale?</p>

"Flotec Utility Pump for Wort Chilling?","<p>After doing a bit of Googling for pumps in order to circulate water through a wort chiller (it being below freezing outside in Maine, I'm worried about using our outside hose hookup for water), I saw a few people say that they'd used the Flotec FP0F360AC Utility Pump. </p>

<p>Picked one up at Home Depot today for ~$85 or so, got home and discovered three unfortunate things in the manual. First, it specifically mentions that the output side shouldn't be under water, which is a problem because that was my plan. Second, the output hose is supposed to be 1/2"" - mine is 5/16"". Most problematically, it says that the output side shouldn't have any coils in it: an obvious issue if you're using a coiled metal wort chiller. </p>

"Troubleshooting wild pours from kegerator","<p>I recently bought an Igloo 6 ft^3 kegerator as my first venture into kegging. It worked very well the first day but has been pouring wildly ever since. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The beer line is 4.5 feet of 3/16"" PVC; based on the numbers from Beersmith, this is a good length to get 1 PSI at the tap for a keg pressure of 12 PSI.</p></li>
<li><p>I left a pint glass of water overnight in the bottom of the kegerator; it measured 32° F this morning. I'm doing another glass on top of the keg tonight but I can't imagine it'll be anywhere near 40° F.</p></li>
<li><p>I plan to pick up some ½"" copper tubing to insulate the beer line in the tower and install it when the parts for my Sanke to Cornelius kit comes in, but because I'm still getting extremely foamy pours two and three pours from the first, I don't think heat is the major cause of these problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This brings me to the regulator, which I think might be faulty. A couple observations and questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there supposed to be any difference in the reading between the pressure with the shutoff valve turned ""off"" and ""on""? With the valve off, I set the regulator to 14 PSI; after turning the valve on, the pressure drops to 9 PSI and stays there. 18 drops to 10, 20 drops to 14 (and then creeps slightly downward). Is this normal? Is it safe to employ a little Kentucky windage on this system? Is it okay to open the shutoff valve and then fine tune the regulator?</li>
<li>What is a ""normal"" magnitude and velocity for needle creep? I'll find that I thought I set the pressure to a stable 12 PSI but when I open the door 15 minutes later it's at 13-14 PSI. When it does this, do I just tweak the regulator and go on about my day? (And how will that affect force carbonating my home-brews?)</li>

<pre><code>(SRM-5.2)*12.2.
</code></pre>

<p>This <a href=""http://byo.com/hops/item/1545-understanding-residual-alkalinity-ph-advanced-homebrewing"" rel=""nofollow"">BYO</a> article states that </p>

<pre><code>`target SRM = 0.14 * RA[CaCO3] + 5.2`, 
</code></pre>

<p>or to restate it,</p>

<pre><code>`RA as CaCO3 = (SRM - 5.2) / 0.14`
</code></pre>

<p>and taking the reciprocal of the divisor we get </p>

<pre><code>RA as CaC03 = (SRM - 5.2) * 7.14
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to John Palmer's high target of <code>(SRM-5.2)*12.2</code>.</p>

<p>So given a beer with 33 SRM, The BYO produces a target RA of ~200 and Palmer's high target produces a target RA of ~339 (his low target is 280).</p>

<p>After about 2 weeks of having syphoned off about 2 litres into a plastic bottle it smelt terrible with what I can only describe as a cheesy aroma. The rest of the batch has a bit of a yeasty smell to it (this is long after having used the activated carbon, finings etc. and syphoning off very liberally) and some that I had syphoned into a glass bottle smells somewhat in between. I have another 30 litres of this stuff brewing and I don't know what to do to ensure it doesn't go to waste if it turns out the same. Would it just be the water I used or some yeast still suspended in the brew or something?</p>

<p>I've been looking into Freeze Concentrating and am considering trying it with this, would that help at all? and more generally what can I do in future to ensure my brews don't have such a tiny shelf life. I made a 25 litre batch of wine a few months ago which has been gradually becoming less and less pleasant while still being fairly gassy (I may have exposed it to oxygen after fermenting but I'm really not sure)</p>

<p>Any help on these matters would be greatly appreciated</p>

"How long does wine take to de-gas without much agitation","<p>I've made a few batches of wine and they seem to turn out alright except for being extremely frothy. I think in the past I've made the mistake of exposing my wine to oxygen when trying to agitate the gas out and I'm wondering if the gas would come out naturally if left alone and if so how long this might take. It seems when I bottle my wine it begins to start tasting off very quickly while the rest left in the fermenter still tastes fine, as if it just has a really short shelf-life. Should I be adding campden tablets? and if so when? I've only ever put my wine into sterile glass bottles but there seems to be a dramatic taste difference overnight.</p>

"Starter quantity w/ Mr. Malty Calculator","<p>I have an imperial stout that seems to have slowed fermentation ~ 1.040. I made a 2L starter w/ Super San Diego yeast on stir plate and pitched it at high krausen.. no decanting.</p>

<p>Based on Mr. Malty's Yeast calculator, I needed 2.75L of starter for an OG 1.10. So I took slurry from my cider (Champagne yeast), created two 2L starters and cold crashing now and will decant this time and pitch both. The amount of yeast at bottom of the starters is very small, less than an inch in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then I got to thinking, is Mr. Malty's calculation of 2.75L of starter including all the liquid or strictly yeast slurry that settles at the bottom? Getting 2.75L of settlement sounds absolutely ridiculous but then again pitching a gallon starter for imperial stouts isn't unrealistic.</p>

<p>I'm pitching two 2L simply because I don't know how healthy that champagne yeast is... and I've got two stir plates, so why not?</p>

<p>EDIT: A better way of asking is: does Mr. Malty calculator assume you're cold crashing and decanting?  </p>

"What might kill a ginger bug - fact and fiction?","<p>I've been attempting to use a ginger bug to make non-alcoholic ginger beer, but I manage to kill the bug each time, either while it is cultivating or after I add it to the ginger syrup.</p>

<p>Overview of my process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put cup of distilled water in a jar or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and two teaspoons of fresh ginger with peel.  Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of ginger at the same time each day, say the evening, and stirring each morning. Stirring may occur</li>
<li>Once there is considerable bubbles, make the ginger tea/syrup in a stainless steel pot. Let it cool. I usually use 2 quarts of distilled water, 1 and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and a lot of chopped/grated ginger, like at least ""4 inches"", usually close to double that.</li>
<li>Once cooled, filter into a larger stainless steel pot. Add another 2 quarts of distilled water, and then filter the active bug into the same pot. Add strained juice of two lemons.</li>
<li>Stir, then immediately bottle the contents.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>No carbonation 2 weeks or even 2 months later.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question simply is: what can <em>actually</em> kill the ginger bug? Some things I've read/thought about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does contact with stainless steel or other metal kill it? Including the strainer, spoons, pots.</li>
<li>Does using distilled water instead of filtered water affect it? Does the chlorine from tap water affect the bug?</li>
<li>I've seen so many different recommendations for the type of sugar used, from white sugar to unrefined sugar to rapadura, does any of that make a difference?</li>
<li>I live in a cold climate this time of year, does that matter? It seems to start OK.</li>
<li>Can too much sugar kill it, in the same way that sugar often helps canned preserves avoid botulism?</li>
<li>Stirring is meant to agitate a bug while cultivating it, but at some point does it hinder instead of help?</li>
<li>Does the amount of water used to start the bug matter?</li>

"My bottles are Conditioning underwater. Why are there bubbles on the caps on day 2 but not day 0 through 1?","<p>On Sunday (day 0) I bottled beer for the first time (with my first batch). I asked my brother how I could determine whether or not I successfully locked the caps onto the bottles to make them air-tight, and he said that I could stick them underwater and look for bubbles to float out.</p>

<p>I live in California, and recently it has averaged 80*F daily. I have used a swamp cooler for my fermentors, so I decided to do the same thing for my conditioning bottles. I got a tub, placed all the bottles in, and then filled the tank with water, completely submerging the bottles. I carefully watched them during this process and noted that none of the bottles released any bubbles. According to my brother's theory, this means I correctly attached the caps to the bottles and made them air-tight.</p>

<p>On day 0 and day 1, nothing happened. Then, on day 2 (Tuesday), all my bottles had varying amounts of bubbles on the caps, underwater. They are just stuck there, chilling. What is the meaning of this? Some caps are completely filled with bubbles, while others only have 10-25% of their surface covered.</p>

<ul>
<li>1700g of LME (Blackrock's Whispering Wheat)</li>
<li>900g DME (came with the kit, not sure exactly of the nature)</li>
<li>Fermentis US-05</li>

<li>OG 1.045 FG 1.012 (the recipe suggested 1.044 and 1.011)</li>
</ul>

<p>.. and the recipe said that the kit made 19L.</p>

<p>I have 2 10L carboys, so I split the wort into 2 ~9.5L chunks.</p>

<p>Today, I bottled the first carboy (I am waiting on a few more bottles to do the second batch).</p>

My current idea is to brew an Irish Red Ale (OG 1.055, FG 1.012, IBU 21, SRM 16) with just enough peated malt to provide barely noticeable smoke taste and aroma.</p>

<p>I originally decided on 1% peated malt (2oz in a 5.5 gallon batch) based on this <a href=""http://www.byo.com/stories/item/1720-smoked-beer"">BYO article</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://discussions.probrewer.com/showthread.php?20733-how-much-peat-malt"">forum thread</a> suggests that 2% or 3% is provides light smokiness. </p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.brews-bros.com/index.php?/topic/53046-peat-smoked-malt-vs-smoked-malt/"">thread</a> seems to conclude that the proper amount of peated malt is zero.</p>

<p>Does anyone have first-hand experience brewing with peated malt? Should I omit it altogether (and perhaps use Rauch malt instead)? Is 1% a safe amount?</p>

"sediment in wine bottle, how to serve","<p>I made some wine recently, and I screwed up slightly.  I degassed the wine the day I was going to bottle.  I let it sit a couple hours expecting the sediment to settle after I ""blended"" the wine, significantly disturbing it.  I guess I should have let it sit after that for days, rather than hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, what's done is done, and I have wine that has a lot of sediment in it.  When drinking it, almost the whole bottom half of the bottle is undrinkable! It <em>tastes</em> fine, but the sediment feel is a tad overbearing.  So what do I do?</p>

<p>Should I get a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002CV90TM"" rel=""nofollow"">decantur</a> with a sediment filter?  Should I just strain it through cheesecloth or something finer when I serve/pour it?  What's finer than cheesecloth and found easily?</p>

<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated; I'm tired of not enjoying the fruits of my labor.</p>

"What's the best/safest way to handle likely bottle bombs?","<p>I'm using <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005CIFIDO"">16oz amber e-z cap bottles</a> (swing tops). I've read that they'll self-vent before exploding, but I've heard other accounts of them actually exploding.</p>

<p>I'm storing them like <a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6ei5d6ntevA/UZMEpdsPZrI/AAAAAAAAHz4/Z_M8PjFEnhM/w480-h640-no/2013-05-14+20.44.18.jpg"">this</a> and it's been a week since bottling. I've been meaning to vent them a few days ago but forgot and tonight when I went to vent them I barely touched the swing top mechanism and it blew off (very loud, like warm champagne) and started gushing.</p>

<p>I pressed the top back on and took it to the sink and after letting it settle for a few seconds was able to get the cap to stay shut. That one is in the back of the fridge currently. The rest are still in the cooler, and I've placed a few large ice chunks and brought the temperature down to ~50 degrees F so hopefully fermentation will slow down (if it's still going) and/or more CO2 will dissolve into the liquid until I can figure out what to do next.</p>

<p>My concern is exploding bottles... and the pressure is potentially still increasing every second (though unlikely after a week I would assume).</p>

<p>What about venting the bottles? Would the safest way be under water in a bucket to slow down the glass if it does explode? Or should I just not be so worried and move them to the fridge ASAP and just be mindful while opening them later?</p>

<p>How likely are these to just blow up in my hand while moving to the fridge or afterwards while opening? Is it normal for a swing top to just blow off like that at room temperature?</p>

<p>Any tips or advice?</p>

<p>Much thanks in advance...</p>

"Kegging vs. Bottling (force-carbonated), what's the difference in taste?","<p>I'm achieving a rather bizarre sense of enlightenment and was hoping someone could explain the impact that force carbonation in a keg vs. force carbonation in a keg with eventually bottling off would have on a beer.</p>

<p>I ask this because I am now on my second beer, this one being an IIPA (Belgian yeast) that I've bottled straight from the keg after it being in the keg for 3-4 weeks, and now that I just cracked one, 2-3 weeks after putting it in the bottles, it tastes profoundly different than when it was in the keg.</p>

<p>I will admit that the hop aroma is dying off (which frankly, given the amount of dry hopping I did, is probably a good thing), the flavor is still mostly there, but it seems a lot more well-rounded and not as disjointed as it did while it was in the keg (bubble gum aroma, not much hop flavor, enamel stripping bitterness, it all seems to be centering on each other into a balanced mix now).</p>

<p>Is this just the effects of aging?  I saw the same thing with a smoked porter using peat malt.  I kegged it at the same time I did this IIPA, and had I not known that I put peated malt in it, I never would have tasted it.  After I bottled it (again, same day as this IIPA, I used 4-5% peated malt), and let it sit until last Thursday, it tasted like someone encapsulated the entire Amazonian rain forest after being burnt to the ground by a bunch of torch wielding 7 foot tall blonde beauties all in one bottle.  I never got that sense of flavor when it was kegged, not even close, and I'm depressed that I drank almost all of it before I could get this flavor out of it.</p>

<p>What gives?  Is it just age?  Does bottling with less head room for the CO2/beer to breathe have some sort of effect on flavor?  Is something else at work?</p>
"
"Does PH affect hop bitterness?","<p>I've always disagreed with the idea that dry hopping or late hopping added 0 IBUs to your end product. If I ever brewed a kit or recipe and followed the hop schedule exactly, it would pretty much always end up too bitter. I found out that my local water pH was high (8.0) when running into some astringency issues and wondered if that had anything to do with it. At first I thought it was the high sulfate content in my water so I did the following tests. What I ended up finding is that lower pH (more acidic water) lessened the perceived bitterness in various hop tea tests. </p>

<p>Two-water hop tea test</p>

<p>8 oz local tap water heated to 160F with 1 hop pellet CTZ (in PPM Ca=45,Mg=15,Na=65,SO4=125,Cl=50,HCO3=225)</p>

<p>8 oz distilled water heated to 160F with 1 hop pellet</p>

<p>Stirred and after 15 minutes examined. I noticed that with the tap water the hops didn't precipitate as much and clumped at the top. The local tap water produced a much more back-of-the tongue bitterness. I had two others test in a blind taste test and they all grimaced when they tasted the tap water hop tea.
The aroma was similar if not more pronounced with the distilled water. </p>

<p>This led me to my next test, trying a cold hop test to mimic dry hopping. </p>

<p>8oz local tap water (see above) with 5 hop pellets CTZ, crushed and stirred. Sat 40F for 12 hours. 
8oz distilled water with 5 hop pellets, crushed and stirred. 40F for 12 hours.</p>

<p>My results were similar to the hot hop tea experiment. The distilled water dry hop tea yielded a much less bitter result while the local tap water dry hop tea was very bitter and harsh. </p>

<p>I thought I had figured it all out, there was some correlation with either high sulfate or HCO3 content but I wanted to see if PH was the determining factor instead of mineral content. I had read that high mineral content accentuated hop bitterness (famously so in Burton water) but in my quest to trying brew a really nice IPA with great aroma and low perceived bitterness. </p>

<p>8oz local tap water (see above) with 5 hop pellets CTZ, crushed and stirred. Sat 40F for 12 hours. 
8oz local tap water with 10 drops lemon juice, 5 hop pellets, crushed and stirred. 40F for 12 hours. No PH readings taken (broken pH meter)</p>

<p>To my surprise there was a big difference, it was very obvious that there was less bitterness with the acidic sample. Also on the high pH sample, the hops clumped at the top and left a clearer liquid. I couldn't notice a difference in aroma. </p>

<p>Can someone replicate this? Maybe someone with a good pH meter?</p>

"Ginger beer that lasts","<p>I want to make a batch of alcoholic ginger beer. However, I know from past experience that one problem with ginger beer is that the bulk of the fermentation happens in the bottles, and I can't drink it fast enough: it gradually hardens and gets more and more bitter (and more alcoholic) until the last bottle is nigh-undrinkable.</p>

<p>What's a good way to prevent this from happening?</p>

<p>I gather that when making, um, non-ginger beer (is there a term for this?), fermentation is controlled by using a mixture of sucrose and lactose. Apparently the yeast will feed off the sucrose but not the lactose, so once the yeast has consumed all the sucrose fermentation stops but you still get a sweet flavour from the lactose. OTOH I have also seen ginger beer kits that have artificial sweeteners in them, probably for the same reason. I can't stand the taste of these; does lactose affect flavour? And would this work with ginger beer anyway?</p>

<p>Are there any other techniques I should look at? Obviously because the bottles are pressurised I can't take the lid off to add anything when I want fermentation to stop. Another thing that might work is irradiation, but unfortunately my fission reactor's on the blink.</p>

"Oxidization during transfer","<p>It has become clear that I need to practice my transfer techniques; I just completed a primary-to-secondary transfer which involved what I'm guessing is a fairly significant amount of aeration.  During my transfer (1-gallon basic brown beer, direct from carboy to carboy; no intermediate pot), I used an auto-siphon, and ended up pumping oxygen in.  In addition, there was air in the line even while the beer was flowing (which I had to restart several times).</p>

<p>Ultimately, if a beer gets aerated, is it a solid bet that the beer will be oxidized and pick up that ""musty, cardboard, stale odor and flavor""?  Should I not get my hopes up, or might things still work out?</p>

<p>Last night, I opened one of the bottles.  Much to my surprise, it was <em>not</em> awful!  The carbonation was a little low, it could have had more flavor, and it was a <em>little</em> stale, but it was not the disaster that I was expecting.  Hooray!</p>

<p>The mead was always in a glass carboy and I just moved it from one to another. I do not have a water air lock for them so I have a balloon I sanitized and sealed around it with plumbers tape. I have a pin hole in it that allows the co2 to leak out. This keeps the balloon inflated but still allows the CO2 to escape properly. For the mead this has been working fantastic and even after racking it is producing enough c02 to inflate the balloon. </p>

<p>My been on the other hand went from a primary (5 gallon bucket with a water air lock) to the glass carboy with the same balloon method. The balloon is barley inflating even after a few days, with out a pin hole punched in it. I know the main fermentation happens to a beer the few few days, and I left it in the primary for 2 weeks. After racking should it be processing enough to inflate the balloon? Or did I accidentally botch my beer? I only have the mead to compare it too, I have never racked beer before. If it is ruined can I fix it by adding a little yeast slurry?</p>

"When is it okay to bottle?","<p>I've brewed literally dozens of Beer House brewkits, but I'm waiting on a Winterfest Ale kit that just won't seem to completely stop secondary fermentation...every other time I made these kits, fermenting is absolutely finished after at most 12 days (at 70 degrees), but this kit just keeps on truckin'.  Today is Day 15, and there's still some minimal but steady bubble activity visible in the glass carboy...you can't watch the airlock move, but there is some CO2 still being generated.    </p>

<p>I certianly don't want to end up with an exploding batch by bottling too soon (these kits include 190g of dextrose for bottling), but I'm also wondering if everything is actually fine and that this will end up being a more completely fermented batch than I'm used to.</p>

<p>Can I go ahead and bottle now as is?  If so, should I cut back a bit on the bottling sugar?  Or should I keep waiting it out until the bubbling completely stops?  </p>

"Secondary Fermenter Temperature -- Colder?","<p>My American Pale Ale has been fermenting away nicely for the past few days and I'm certain I'll be racking to secondary within a few days (after SG gets stable). </p>

<p>I'm curious: I've been keeping my primary stable at ~68°F using a 10 gallon utility bucket filled with water and 100-Watt fish tank heater; can I unplug the heater (I'd like to save the power) and just keep the secondary in the water bath? I live in Southern California, so the low will only be in the high 40's at worst, with the water bath probably averaging ~60°F.</p>

"Are the terms ""dry"", ""low FG"" and ""drinkable"" synonymous?","<p>Hopefully this doesn't fall under ""opinion"" but I believe this will help alleviate some questions on mashing/fermentation techniques. I guess you could break this question into parts. Also the term ""drinkable"" is assuming the beer is without off-flavors:</p>

<p>Are the terms ""dry"" and ""drinkable"" synonymous? My initial answer would be no, since I've had Imperial Stouts that I'd consider more drinkable (not to be mistaken with sessionable) than a dry-stout, say Guinness. Then I've had stouts with lots of residual sweetness that were good, just more of a sipping beer. Although, a ""bone dry"" beer may not be considered drinkable either. So without answering my own question, I guess it's safe to say drinkable is more related to residual sweetness/alcohol perception?     </p>

<p>Are the terms ""dry"" and ""low FG"" synonymous? Again, a dry beer tends to be low FG but not necessarily the other way around? Can you have a dry beer that was mashed at the higher temp range.. if so what type of body would you expect? I'll use Duvel and Jolly Pumpkin as an example. Both produce great beers that favor the dry side, but certainly do not lack in body. I know Duvel finishes low, Jolly Pumpkin it depends on the beer.. but a good amount finish low. </p>

<p>I see these terms being tossed around a lot, it would be good to back them up with some facts.</p>

"Bad ""Canned Meat"" smell after bottling, and briefly mid-fermentation","<p>I've had an ongoing problem for the last several months that never used to happen:  My brew smells pretty normal during fermentation, except midway through, it changes from the normal US-05 yeast smell to a ""canned meat"" smell, which is reminiscent of barley in soup.  It is only there briefly, and by the time I bottle, it's totally gone.</p>

<p>After bottling, and letting the beer carbonate, when I open a bottle, and then pour into a glass, that same smell is back again, and it won't go away.  The flavor seems decent, but if I belch, I can taste the ""smell"".  On rare occasions, it dissipates totally after 8-10 weeks.</p>

<p>I've never had this problem before, and it even happened with DME.  I mainly brew All Grain.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure it's an infection, since it always gets better, but it doesn't always clear up, completely.  The taste really isn't affected that much, either.</p>

<p>What is going on?  I've scoured the internet, but to no avail.  Palmer's book doesn't give any clues.</p>

<p>I use plastic fermenters, so should I just replace them?  They are in good shape.  The smell just ruins the beer.  I'm about ready to quit brewing!</p>

"Secondary fermentation including carbonation in a Corney keg","<p>I am making my third batch of cider using juice from a local farm, so far its worked out well other than a persistent haze in one batch. I want to try and simplify / improve by process by removing a racking and priming step if possible. I would like to rack my bucket fermentation early at an SG that will ensure i generate sufficent additional CO2 in keg for the finished product. What calculation should I be using assuming I will run to total dryness? eg. If I rack at 1.020 and after the secondary ferm end at just below 1 what volumes of CO2 will be in the cider assuming I keep the keg sealed or an appropiate top pressure? Could I use this to produce fully sparkling cider for bottling?
If any one has any insight, guidance or advise I would be most greatful.

"Which fermentation temperature should I favor?","<p>I am doing a dual brew this weekend.

I'll be pitching a nice, fresh yeast slurry of WL San Francisco Lager yeast (a really versatile and clean hybrid ale/lager yeast, very good stuff). I like to ferment this beer @ 58*F.</p>

<p>Second batch will be another Jamil recipe - Chocolate Hazelnut Robust Porter (don't have the recipe handy, sorry). I was thinking of using the same yeast, since I have a bunch of slurry, but trying to ferment it warmer to get some esters (like, 68*F).</p>

<p>I have a chest freezer I can ferment both batches at once in, but I will obviously need to pick one temp or another. So do I go for 68 for the porter, allowing for some esters in my Cal Common? Or go 58, making the Cal Common happy but maybe losing flavor in the porter? Shoot for the middle ground of 63?</p>

"Boiling Equipment (Burner, Pot, Wort Chiller)","<p>So I am looking into upgrading the gear I use to do a boil.  Currently I have a 5 gallon stainless steal pot, I use an electric range to heat the water, and my kitchen sink to cool down the wort.  It works, but I have had problems with my wort boiling over lately.  I have tried putting less water in for the boil, then top up in the fermenter later, but this has lead to some scorching.  Not to mention that fact it takes quite a while to get the wort to a boil and even longer to cool it off.  The obvious answer is to upgrade my gear.</p>

<p>I know very little about boiling setups.  It seems propane is a popular choice, but anything that can boil water quickly and keep an even, controllable temperate I will consider.  Also, what should I look for in a brew pot? Are cooling coils for the wort worth it?  Amazon has some good deals, but I wouldn't mind giving a specialty home brew site my business either. I would like to keep it under $150.  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for all of the feedback. Amazon had a great combo deal with a propane burner, 8 gallon stainless pot, and wort chiller for $150.  However, the shipping put it over $225. So I went with a 10 gal pot (same brand just bigger and no shipping fee for the same price) and a Bayou burner.  I will get the wort chiller some other time.  I decided it was better to get some good quality gear, rather than go for lesser quality pieces that I know I will replace in short order.</p>

"Shipping beer to fellow brewers","<p>A few college friends of mine have started brewing beer recently and we were wondering what the best way to ship our beers across the country is?  Our ideas so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just bottle it, wrap it, and ship it</li>
<li>Siphon off of secondary into a few 2 liter coke bottles, ship with the proper amount of bottling sugar in a zip-lock bag, and let them bottle it upon arrival</li>
</ul>

<p>With the second idea we were thinking that it would be easier/cheaper to ship because the 2 liters are non-breakable.  It would also have the advantage of being under little to no pressure, which would be good if it had to travel by air I suppose.  Are there any drawbacks to this idea, aside from possibly imparting a cola taste from insufficient rinsing?</p>

"First Time Brewing...am I doing it right?","<p>So I went to my local brewing store, and got a starter kit. It came with a 7 gallon fermenter, a siphon tube, a floating thermometer, bottle caper, bottle caps, bottle scrubber, and sanitizer.</p>

<p>By the way I have multiple questions. I know most first time brewing experiences are uneasy, but I was hoping someone could make mine slightly easier. I explained to the lady at the brew shop that I wanted to make a blonde ale similar to the one Sierra Nevada makes. She recommended a ""Cooper"" extract for my first time that would provide a similar beer. The directions say to simply boil it with the recommended amount of water and 1kg of corn sugar.</p>

<p>I did that exactly, then added the recommended amount of cool water to my (plastic) fermenter. I added ice cubes to bring it down to 70 degrees F. Once that was done I had read that it was more effective to ""prepare"" your yeast, rather than sprinkling it on in powder form.</p>

<p>By ""preparing"" my yeast, I sanitized a cup, added hot water, let poured the yeast into it, and let it dissolve for 10 minutes. After that I mixed it up, and poured it into the cooled wort.</p>

<p>I closed the lid and added the Air Lock. It has been over 24 hours, and I have not seen any bubbles, although I haven't been checking more than twice a day due to my schedual.</p>

<p>Everything was sanitized might I add. My questions are these. Did I make a mistake somewhere? How important is keeping the fermenting brew between 65 and 75 degrees? and do I need a second fermenter?</p>

"Does aging the beer make a huge difference?","<p>I made a Blonde Ale about 3 months ago, and it had a really bitter and strange taste to it. It was drinkable and ok, but not great. I thought the problem was that there was sanitizer flavor in my beer. So the next batch (Cherry Stout) I did all glass primary and secondary fermentation to mitigate the sanitizer flavor. The beer had a pretty much identical flavor to the young Blonde Ale, drinkable but not great. I generally followed the 1-2-3 rule (1 week primary, 2 weeks secondary, 3 weeks bottle), but moved out of the primary based on a the desired gravity reading, so the usual fermenting/conditioning time.</p>

<p>After my Blonde Ale had aged for 3 months, I tasted it again and it tasted amazing! I couldn't believe it! It was a night and day difference between the odd flavor it started out with and how it tasted after aging for 3 months. Is this always the case? Right now my Cherry Stout doesn't taste very well, but if I give it 3 months, do you think it will taste significantly better?</p>

"Are beer kits any good?","<p>I started my first homebrew a few days ago. I used a John Bull India Pale Ale beer kit made by Young's (West Midlands, UK). The airlock is bubbling away merrily and I've taken the lid off the fermenter and had a sniff - got a huge fizzy hit in the nose (won't get so close next time!) and can detect a general beery smell so hopefully all will be well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering what sort of result I might expect as a newbie from a beer kit (assuming no silly mistakes)? I'm not expecting to win any awards, but on the other hand, it's going to be a waste of effort if it's undrinkable.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Can a newbie make something drinkable or is it going to take years of experience?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks for answers so far. Sounds like it could be better than I was hoping it might be! I'll come back and update once it's done and let you know how I got on.</p>

<p>Some extra info: The kit cost £10 and included yeast (in a sachet). The instructions were to tip the canned malt-extract into a brewing bin, add 1kg of sugar and add 4 litres of boiling water, so I didn't need much special equipment. Stir and top-up to 23 litres with cold water.</p>

<p>So, ingredients cost £11.</p>

<p>Equipment (so far):</p>

<ul>
<li>£15 - Brew bin</li>
<li>£2  - Bung and airlock</li>
<li>£3  - hydrometer</li>
<li>£3  - trial jar</li>
<li>£3  - Bruclens steriliser (sanitizer)</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2:
Wow - it came out better than I expected, but pretty much in line with the opinions expressed here - that is, I don't think it was award-winning, but it was certainly very drinkable (all gone now!) I've paid money in pubs for stuff that wasn't as nice. I've got a second kit on the go now - will probably stick to kits initially, but will be back here for advice/info when I want to progress from there. Thanks for the answers and encouragement.</p>

"Fermenator Question(s)","<p>After 20 years of fermenting in glass carboys, I recently dove in and bought a Blichmann Fermenator.  I Scrubbed it according to the docs that came with it, and then gave it my usual BTF soak and air dry before brewing with it.</p>

<p>The first batch had a pretty godawful metallic or.. I don't really know how to classify it... harsh smell after 1 week in primary.  Same recipe I had just brewed successfully a month prior, sans the funky smell.  After a week I dumped trub, dry hopped for 2 weeks of secondary.  The smell remained.  It's not a spoilage smell-- after sharing it with other homebrew geeks we all agree it's not an infection smell.  It's pretty astringent, slightly metallic, maybe somewhat chemical.  Though my mash was only at 150º so I shouldn't have extracted tannins to give astringency.  The beer tastes fine, not great.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I popped the lid after 3 weeks, there was a layer of black scum on the sides of the fermenator just above the krausen ring.  Oily.  Not green or white like most mold.  The beer itself looked like... well... beer.</p>

<p>I ended up dumping the batch and brewing again.  This new batch has remnants of that smell, but not quite as bad.  It was a long road to get here, but here's the question, at long last:  </p>

<p>is there something I need to know about fermenting in steel?  Does this funky smell blow off once it gets to glass or gets carbonated?  Or was I blowing it off before by racking/oxygenating and just never got to smell my beer at this stage?</p>

<p>I figure I could save a lot of time in my own process by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Transfering my hot wort directly from the boil kettle to the keg, using the keg itself as my 'no chill' container</p></li>
<li><p>Fermenting in the keg letting the air come out from one of the valves (I do not need to see bubbles, but I guess I'll need to find a way to depress the ball locks so the air comes out)</p></li>
<li><p>Force carbonating directly on that keg after fermentation</p></li>
<li><p>Chilling and dispensing, dumping the first few pints of yeast/slurry. My loss may even diminish!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One single vessel, no transfers, no need to sanitize anything.</p>

<p>The only downside I see is the possibility of having the keg lines clogged with yeast and some extra work cleaning the krausen formed during fermentation after the keg is empty (dried out and likely stuck, a good soak in PBW should take care of it?)</p>

"Water mineral additions, losses to mash, and evaporation in the kettle. I.e., does water lost to the mash result in a proportionate loss of ions?","<p>Rephrasing my question:</p>

<p>I see three separate ways of calculating the final ppm of various minerals in the end product.</p>

<p>Say I begin with 9 gallons of DH20. After the mash, I lost 1.5 gallons and end up with 7.5 gallons in the boil kettle. After boiling, I lose 1.5 gallons to evaporation and end up with 6 gallons of wort.</p>

<p>Let's pretend I'm aiming for 200ppm of Sulphate. CaSO4 gives 61.5ppm of Ca and 147.4ppm of SO4 for one gram in one water. Therefore, 1.36g/gallon of CaSO4 will result in ~200ppm of SO4 and ~84ppm Ca (200/147.4ppm = ~1.36g CaSO4).</p>

<p>Do I multiply 1.36g by 9 gallons of water - my total starting water? <strong>This assumes both that I lost 1.36g*1.5gal to the mash and also 1.36g*1.5gal to evaporation.</strong> (Obviously salts don't boil off so this is incorrect)</p>

<p>Do I multiple 1.36g by 7.5 gallons of water - my starting water less that which I lost to the mash? <strong>This assumes that by losing 1.5 gallons of water to the mash, I am also losing 1.36g*1.5gal</strong>, leaving me with 1.36g*6gal CaSO4/gal.</p>

<p>Do I multiply 1.36g by 6 gallons of water - my starting water less that which I lost to the mash less that which I lost to evaporation? <strong>This assumes that the 1.5gal I lost to the mash did not also lose the 1.36g*1.5gal CaSO4</strong>, leaving me with 1.36g*6gal CaSO4/gal.</p>

<p>I'm reading Brewing Better Beer and Gordon Strong states ""Homebrewers should be aware that you don't have to put all the salts in the mash, and that not all salts in the mash carry over to the kettle.""

Refractometer is very well calibrated (checking it before every measurement), but I get results like 3.1% brix, which yields <em>very</em> low FG results, like 1.001.

"
"Should I be worried about my bottles exploding?","<p>Alright, so this is my first batch where I came up with the recipe instead of using a recipe kit, and something seems to have gone wrong. Here are my brewing notes so you can see exactly what I did:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U9JBF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So, I brought 3 gallons of water up to a boil, then added all 13 pounds of malt extract, which actually almost filled up the 5 gallon kettle. After brewing, I added maybe 1 more gallon of water to the fermenter, then took a gravity reading. (It was a 6 gallon fermenter, but wasn't quite full and had a crap ton of sediment, so I'm guessing I had around 5 gallons) Here is where the first unexpected thing happened - my OG reading was 1.072, which seemed really low, especially since the calculator I used estimated 1.095. </p>

<p>I'm on a time crunch to have this ready for a homebrew beer fest on Feb 25, so I bottled it after 2 weeks in the fermentor. I assumed it would be done fermenting and did not even check to see if the airlock was still bubbling... Which obviously I would go back and change if I could. So we siphon as much beer as we can out of the fermentor, and end up with 3 gallons. Not exactly sure how, but there was so much sediment in the fermentor that it was hard to get clear beer out when we were near the bottom. </p>

<p>This is where I start to worry - we take a gravity reading and it is 1.040. Now I'm a little worried that there are still fermentable sugars in the beer, especially since I didn't check to see if it was still bubblin, and the calculator estimated FG at 1.027. </p>

<p>One more issue - I put in 3/4 cups of priming sugar, which is the amount for 5 gallons, and I only had 3. </p>

<p>So here is my question - should I be worried about my bottles exploding? Also, can you think of any explanations for why my OG was so low? It doesn't make any sense to me. And on the FG... Is there any way that fermentation could be done with it being that high? Thanks for any clarification you can give. </p>

"How to avoid homebrew-cider to explode out of the bottle when opening?","<p>I'm in my first year making apple-cider from harvested apples.</p>

<p>The fermentation started 10 days ago. I let it bubble for 7 days and I filled some of clear juice it into a small bottle (using a Lightning type stopper) - just to see.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening I wanted to open the bottle to try. When flipping the stopper, 3/4 of the beverage spurted out. (I expected something like this and was outside). What was left was quite good, but didn't have any bubbles.</p>

<p>What did I do wrong? How to avoid these kind of explosions? How to stock cider into bottles correctly?</p>
"
"Can I increase the carbonation of already-bottled beer?","<p>I just made my first ever batch of beer, and it turned out great! The only thing is that my priming sugar calculation was slightly under what it should have been. I added 1/4 cup honey to a (finished volume) 2.5-gallon batch, and I should have been closer to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.</p>

<p>The beer is carbonated, but it could use a little more. Is there <em>any</em> way to increase the carbonation? I.e. by, in a sanitary environment, opening the bottle, adding a bit more priming sugar, and re-capping? Assume that I have enough head space to actually do that (I do, because I was afraid of my bottles exploding so I left a bit more than I needed to).</p>

<p>I'm happy with how the beer turned out regardless, so it's not a big deal. In my next batch I can just increase the amount of priming sugar. But bubbles are nice, so I'm curious: <strong>can I increase the carbonation of already-bottled beer?</strong></p>
"
"Looking for ways to reduce trub","<p>More specifically:
Some time ago I switched from fly sparge to batch sparge. My motivation was that I noticed quite a bit of channeling on deeper grain beds with the fly sparge. Batch is quicker and at least as efficient, but seems to generate a fair bit of trub. I'm guessing this comes from the fact that I have to settle the grain bed multiple times, and run off multiple times. </p>

<p>I vorlauf the friggin' bejesus out of it. I have a March pump and recirc the mash for at least a couple of minutes. Maybe some kind of inline filter would help me but I don't want to deal with the BS of having a stuck sparge because my filter is clogged.</p>

<p>My other thought is opening up the gap (currently 0.035) to something more like 0.050 so less of the malt gets powdered.</p>

<p>Yes? No? Maybe? What else?</p>

"Why did I miss my high target gravity? By quite a lot. Is it just my brewhouse efficiency?","<p>I cooked up my first Double IPA recipe over the weekend but have seriously missed the mark with the target gravity. So much so it most definitely won't be a Double.</p>

<p>Target O.G. = 1.085<br>
Actual O.G. = 1.050</p>

<p><strong>Malt bill</strong></p>

<p>The malt bill was as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>75%    Maris Otter  
12.5%  Malted flaked oats  
10%    CaraHell  
2.5%   CaraPils
</code></pre>

<p>A volume of 30L gave me a rough required extract for 1.085 gravity of 6.66kg. After adjusting the weights for their efficiencies/max yield I came out with:</p>

<pre><code>                               Weight      Max Yield    Actual weight
Maris Otter           75%      4.995kg     82.5%        6.055kg
Malted flaked oats    12.5%    0.833kg     70.0%        1.190kg
CaraHell              10%      0.666kg     74.0%        0.900kg
CaraPils              2.5%     0.167kg     71.4%        0.234kg
</code></pre>

<p>This gave me a total weight of 8.401kg. My mash and sparge volumes were:</p>

<p>Mash = 26L<br>
Sparge = 16L</p>

<p><strong>Mash</strong></p>

<p>The mash started off a little too hot and so I ended up doing a 150 minute mash. The readings went as so:  </p>

<pre><code>T = 0    temp = 72.7ºC
T = 20   temp = 71.6ºC
T = 40   temp = 70.1ºC
T = 60   temp = 68.0ºC
T = 80   temp = 66.5ºC
T = 100  temp = 65.8ºC
T = 120  temp = 65.4ºC
T = 150  temp = 64.9ºC
</code></pre>

<p>After transferring the wort to the boiler, where it sat on at a low setting for a couple of minutes while I added the sparge water to the mash tun, I had a wort temperature of 68.4ºC and a gravity reading of 1.034. Adjusted for temperature using <a href=""https://www.brewersfriend.com/hydrometer-temp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">brewers friend</a> it came out with a reading of 1.051. I was a bit despondent at seeing this.</p>

<p>My sparge after finishing had a reading of 1.017 and a temperature of 73.1ºC. Brewers friend only goes to 71ºC but it gives a rough gravity of 1.035.</p>

<p>There were 400g of hops in the boil/flame out. After boiling and cooling the wort I topped it up with about 3.5L of the leftover sparge water and a further 2.5L of water to top it up to 30L (I also used some of that sparge water to top up the boil). My end gravity was 1.050.</p>

<p><strong>Brewhouse efficiency</strong><br>
Writing this out I realise I did not adjust my recipe for brewhouse efficiency. However, assuming I did nothing wrong, that gives me an appalling efficiency of 58.8%. That is so bad I think there was something more to it. Had the gravity been in the region of 1.064 I could safely write this off as a failure to accommodate for the brewhouse efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
So while I aimed for 1.085, after adjusting for a rough brewhouse efficiency of 75% I should have hit 1.064. I actually hit 1.050.<br>
- Why was I so far off the mark?<br>
- Are there any tips for consistently hitting high target gravities?</p>

"Bottled a Belgian ale not carbonating","<p>I used white labs abbey ale yeast - fermentation went well and flocculated quite a bit. I then bottled straight from primary. I noticed that not a lot of yeast went into the bottles which hasn't really happened before (usually there's a visible layer or sediment. Also doesn't help that it's quiet dark brown in a brown bottle. </p>

<p>Anyway, the bottles have been sitting for about 10 days now, so I cracked one open to see how carbonation was going and nothing...completely flat. Tried another bottle same thing - bottles are near new and were sanitised so that's not the issue.</p>

<p>If only a small amount of yeast got in the bottles - should they still carbonate ok given more time or am I destined for a flat batch?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
It is carbonating, just very slowly. They needed some rotation, a warmer room + time. 4 weeks and beer has low levels of carbonation</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Most bottles have carbonated at 7-8weeks. I noticed some do not have a fine yeast layer on the bottom so could have somehow not gotten much. Another thought for the overall slow carbonation, is that I didn't mix/turn the bottles an hour+ after bottling when the sugar had dissolved. Other than that, it may be but down to super malty beers?</p>

<p>In the past (without using hop bags) I have noticed a substantial ring of hops in my fermentor just above the ready to bottle beer.  I have not had a hard time siphoning the beer out and leaving the hops behind, but this is my first dry hopped beer and I anticipate those may be more detrimental to clarity.</p>

<p>So what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a hop bag?  Does everyone use them?  Will it help my clarity? Will Flavor be affected?  Are they more suited for the boil or dryhopping?</p>

I was mid-swing into the trash can when I wondered if maybe I could use this old stuff for yeast starters? A good boil should clean up any nasties in there right?

"How long can milled grain be stored?","<p>At the rate that I'm going, I'm doing a homebrew roughly every second weekend.  (Fun!)  I will end up with a small stock of hops, and yeast I can keep around in the fridge for a while if I buy a few extra vials, but I'm wondering about milled grains?</p>

<p>I don't have the space or inclination to mill myself.  If I want to pick up 5-10 pounds of base grains and a small stock of specialty grains, and have them milled by my LHBS at time of purchase, how long can I expect them to stay fresh in a bugproof container in a cool, dark, dry corner of a closet?</p>

"bottles not fermented after 3 weeks of conditioning. Good or bad?","<p>It's been three weeks, and my impatience has had me crack one bottle on days 7, 14, and now 20.  There's no carbonation in these bottles, and it doesn't appear to be getting any better over the weeks.  I pop the top and if I'm not paying attention, I won't hear the escape of CO2/O2 come out, it's that faint.</p>

<p>At this point, should I continue to let them sit in bottles?  After a few more weeks, if they don't carbonate, what are my options?  Is it even worth the effort to go through and figure out how to siphon them out and back in?</p>

<hr>

<p>To add a bit more context to the situation: After I racked it off primary and into secondary for a month, I had just started to wash yeast, and was curious if I could wash the yeast that came off secondary fermentation and bottling.  So after taking the beer out of secondary and into bottles, I harvested the yeast in the carboy.  Yes, I am no aware that harvesting yeast out of secondary is not nearly as good as harvesting off primary, but at the time I didn't.  Before that realization occurred, I had actually pitched one of the yeasts into a batch of beer after giving it a good shot at success with a starter.  That harvested yeast did not ferment, and I had to pitch other yeast instead.  Not sure how much context that adds as to the health of the yeast in suspension in the bottles, but I figured I'd mention it.</p>

<p>TLDR: The yeast harvested off the beer from secondary fermentation did not ferment another batch of beer made after harvesting, despite using a yeast starter.</p>

"Total Volume of Yeast Starter in Regards to Evaporation from Boiling Wort","<p>Today I did my first yeast starter. I purchased the 2000mL flask and DME from northernbrewer, and it came with instructions for doing both 1000mL and 2000mL batches. It suggests 1000mL for 5 gallons of wort with OG of up to 1.080. </p>

<p>For 1000mL, it says to put in 650mL of water and 1/2 cup DME. </p>

<p>For 2000mL, it says to put in 1300mL of water and 1 cup of DME.</p>

<p>So I meant to do a 1000mL starter but ended up putting a full cup in, so I added enough water to equate 1300mL.</p>

<p>I did have a boil over (!) which will disrupt this question, but I thought it was relatively small.</p>

<p>My final liquid wort volume was 800-850mL. After pitching in the liquid yeast, the final amount rose to 1000mL.</p>

<p>So my ""2000mL"" starter is now half the volume.</p>

<p>It is impossible that the boil over I had took out one half the volume. </p>

<p>However I did a strong boil which most definitely added to the loss from the evaporation. </p>

<p>1) Does it matter at all if a 2000mL starter ended up as 1000mL of liquid? As long as I have the full cup of DME, the total volume shouldn't matter, right?</p>

<p>2) If not, Is it best to do a very light boil instead of a rigorous boil, so that the final amount of liquid will be closer to the amount you started with?</p>

"Yeast Starter Vortex Size","<p>I've read online that the size of the vortex in a yeast starter does not matter. Why is this true? </p>

<p>When I was experimenting with water yesterday, I created a monster vortex (very cool) and could see air bubbles screaming all over the water; turning the vortex down into a baby vortex resulted in no air bubbles screaming all over. Some people say that the point of the vortex is just to keep the yeast in suspension which will make contact with the air in the vortex. Others say you need a monster vortex so that the air bubbles can scream through the solvent and aerate the wort. Which is correct?</p>

<p>If you simply stir your 5 gallons of wort, it will not aerate much at all. The reason you splash it is to introduce oxygen bubbles into the wort, which aerates it better. Given that everyone agrees on this, why would a small vortex with no screaming air bubbles be able to aerate the yeast starter?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Well I figured if the point of the vortex was to aerate the yeast-starter, why not use my aeration-stone and oxygen tank? So I hung the stone in for 60 seconds which created a lot of foam, but the stir plate got rid of the foam.</p>

<p>It made me think: now that my yeast starter is aerated, why should I care about the size of the vortex (given the assumption that the greater the vortex, the greater the aeration)?</p>

<p>Why care about the vortex at all (given the assumption that vortex size has nothing to do with aeration) ?</p>

"How might trub effect taking original gravity?","<p>For the beer that I brewed this past weekend, I finally remembered to take an Original Gravity reading.  Unlike my previous last three attempts, I actually had a little more than my target 1 gallon, so I poured a little into the hydrometer.</p>

<p>However, the wort was somewhat sediment &amp; trub heavy at that point.  Not to the point that the hydrometer was bottomed out, though.  But a small layer settled down, and there was some floating stuff.</p>

<p>Would this effect the reading?  </p>

<p>I found this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/5266/lots-of-trub-affecting-specific-gravity-readings"">question and answer</a> about taking a reading, but there didn't seem to be a conclusive answer.  Perhaps, looking back, I should have allowed the floating stuff to settle, or swirled the tube to help it settle.  However, my instinct is to say that unless the hydrometer is sitting on sediment, then the reading will be the same, since the hydrometer works on buoyancy.  (I will float the same amount in ocean water, whether it's at the beach or over the Mariana Trench.)  Is this correct?</p>

"When to add DME if you miss your starting OG?","<p>My family was very nice to me this Christmas and I got a bayou classic burner and an 32qt. pot with 2 ports and a bazooka screen as well as an immersion chiller.  I had built a 10 gallon mash tun over the summer (I was doing partial mashes for the last couple batches) so now I am ready for  all grain full boil 5 gallon batches.  Only thing is I have never done this before (can't wait though) so I don't know the efficiency of the system.  I picked my first recipe, my fiance loves the rogue hazelnut nectar so I am going to attempt to duplicate that as best I can.</p>

<p>My question is this, when do you measure the OG to determine if you have missed your mark?  I purchased my ingredients along with 1 lb. of Light DME.  I only need about 1 cup of that for my starter so I figure if I miss my OG I could use the rest of that to hopefully get to where I need to be.  So, when would I measure the gravity of the wort to determine if I need to add the DME?  Do I check it immediately after the I have sparged (pre-boil) or do I check after the full boil and hop additions?  If the later is the case obviously I would need to boil a small 'wort' for the dme so how would I calculate how much I would need to use?</p>

"Carbonation gone wrong?","<p>I was trying my first all grain brew yesterday when I realized that the beer was almost flat, which is weird because they spent about a week inside the bottle. It's a belgian golden ale and I've added about 10ml of a primming solution of 80g of sugar diluted in about 450ml of water (used an online calculator) for 33 cl bottles. What exactly has gone wrong? Was the yeast already dead at bottling or there wasn't enough sugar? </p>

"What can have caused my mead to have the taste of yeast?","<p>I brew my first mead one month ago. I've put 1 dose of honey for about 3.5 of water. Ended up with a 2 liters of must in a pet bottle. I've put 10 grams of yeast (the entire sachet).<br>
Since i started, one month has passed and apparently there is no more fermentation.
So i siphoned it from the pet bottle in two glass bottles.<br>
I just took a sip of the mead and i noticed a very distinct taste of yeast.<br>
What can have happened? Did i put too much yeast? Or is it normal and the taste of yeast is going to fade after i siphoned it from the main container?</p>

It was bubbling nicely the first three days, but now it seems to have gone flat. It still has a pleasant smell and doesn't appear to have any mold on it, so I'm kinda tempted to drink it/make a de-carbonated soda, and start over again fresh. Do you think it will recover if I just keep feeding it/burping it? Also, can I just drink it straight or do you think that will make me sick? Anyway, thanks :)</p>

"Was my mash pH okay? Should I be adjusting it?","<p>I am still new to brewing: First attempt with Christmas gifts used a refill kit that turned out to be partial - resulted in stout that tasted fine but is very weak. Second attempt is due to be bottled later this morning. This second attempt is a ""North of England"" brown ale LME / grain kit.</p>

<p>I've been reading quite a bit from John Palmer's ""How to Brew"" which seems to be a pretty complete guide, and I'm reading a lot about water. I've managed to get the local water reports (Irving,TX - water supplied via Dallas). Using the calculators inside the back of the book, I'm coming up with a mash pH of 5.7-5.8. This seemed a good match for a brown ale.</p>

<p>I measured the mash with brewing pH strips (as I'm starting out, I'm wary of investing in too much expensive equipment upfront - I can get a pH meter later if necessary). Okay pH strips aren't the most accurate, but I came up with a result more in the 5 - possibly 5.4 range. This is way off the bottom of the scale in the book!</p>

<p>I guess my question is, is it possible the mash was really that low? Or are the papers really that inaccurate? Of course the mash was a brown colour (as were the indicator colours), and the papers have a 0.4 resolution in the scale indicator. Could mash temperature have influenced the reading?</p>

<p>If it helps, the kit was 50/50 Amber and Dark malts with speciality grains mostly Caramel (3/4th) and lesser (1/8ths) special B and chocolate.</p>

<p>Looking forwards, I plan to brew quite a few English porters (a type of beer I like), but will not start these until Autumn (however much I like a good porter, they're not for a Texas summer!). I'm assuming I should adjust the chemistry for these?
Before that, I intend to brew paler beers - I've just ordered an ESB kit, and after that I was thinking of more of a summer pale ale.</p>

"Why do people purge kegs before force carbonating?","<p>What is the point in ""burping"" a keg right before force carbonating it? When the co2 hits the keg during carbonation it is going to provide a protective blanket to any air above it.</p>

<p>I am confused about this practice and I believe it is redundant. I can't offer evidence because I always burp the keg myself. :-) </p>

<p>If you want to serve cask ale at home with a beer engine and not have oxygen spoil your beer there is a device which can be connected to your co2 tank which will shoot a burst of co2 into your keg each time the beer engine is pumped and oxygen is shot into your keg. This co2 will protect your beer from the oxygen and this way you can have cask ale at home without having to finish it all in one go. The fact that this works should be reason enough that burping is unnecessary. </p>

<p>Here are a couple of videos showing this device:</p>

"Effect on a low gravity boil size on IBUs in the final batch","<p>This question is a follow-up to the original one regarding the effect on boil size on IBUs.
(<a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/3625/effect-of-boil-size-on-ibus"">Effect of boil size on IBUs</a>)
I understand that the boil gravity tends to lessen the utilisation of hops and the extraction of alpha acids, because the sugars are just taking up the place.</p>

<p>Now, what would be the risk / downside of boiling hops beforehand in (near) water (none or small amount of brewing sugar / malt added), then letting the hopped water cool down and adding malts, or malt extract? In particular, would it not just make a lot more sense, when brewing with an unhopped malt extract, to simply boil hops in a small amount of water with a just little bit of extract added to it?</p>

<p>To illustrate a specific case:
I have an unhopped malt extract, hop pellets, and a pot of only 6 litres for boiling them.</p>

<p>Also very importantly, how would one calculate the IBUs when implementing such a procedure?</p>

"Adding boiling wort on previous batches yeast sediments","<p>I've been using kegs as fermentors and 'no chill' vessels.</p>

<p>With pressurized fermentation I'm getting so much less sediment and krausen, and actually I purge the yeast before and after transfer, so ending with not so much thing inside the kegs.</p>

<p>I've seen people using yeast nutrients or baker's yeast on the boil to help fermentation, so, I was thinking:</p>

<p>if I let my fermentors waiting pressurized and then fill it again with another boiling wort, what I will get?</p>

<p>How yeast trub, break material and krausen things left by a previous batch could act in a new batch?</p>

<p>My surmise is that the boiling wort will help dissolving krausen, kill every yeast cell inside the keg, and this material will easy fall down until the end of fermentation and maybe my fermentation will be more ""healthy"" with all this nutrients. In the bargain, the cleaning of a fermentor could be skiped.</p>

How much time do you recommend for fermentation (and what temps), and how much time for lagering?</p>

<p>Here is my recipe:</p>

"Sarsaparilla beer?","<p>I was enjoying some craft sodas with some friends wile brewing a saison recently, and the idea of a sarsaparilla beer occurred to me as a not terrible idea. My instinct is to go with a pale ale (or IPA?), but maybe a stout or porter would work well too.</p>

<p>Has this been done before?
When should I add the sarsaparilla (boil, post-boil, secondary, etc.), and in what form (extract, dried roots, etc.)?
Does it make sense to add the other ingredients typically included in sarsaparilla soda (like sassafras, licorice, and wintergreen)?</p>

"Is my lager done fermenting? More yeast?","<p>I put my lager in the primary fermenter roughly 30 days ago.  The original gravity was around 1.060 and 5 days ago when I took a reading it was at about 1.013.  Today it's at 1.012 - so it doesn't seem to be moving much.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's supposed to get down farther?  I do not have a good lagering vessel (it is fermenting in plastic), so I was planning on priming and bottling it after primary fermentation and then lagering it in the bottle.</p>

<p>I think it's probably ready to go (tastes great), but I'm worried that one of two things will happen - either it's not done and it will overcarbonate, or enough of the yeast have died that it won't carbonate at all.</p>

"Aging a naturally carbonated ale that was bottled from a keg","<p>Okay, let's see if I can keep this question brief--I have a lot of followup questions that go with this so it may be difficult.</p>

<p>Background:  Last year I decided to start doing an annual Birthday Brew Day Barleywine, wherein I'll brew a barleywine each year on my birthday and age it for years to come (for as long as I can keep them in stock...we'll see how long it goes).  Last years finished off at 10.1% abv, while this years batch is at 9.7 % or so (currently in the secondary).</p>

<p>Context:  I HATE BOTTLING!!!  No, seriously, I really f$#%ing hate it!!! So, I keg all of my brews, and occasionally fill bottles from the keg using a technique that prevents oxidation and preserves proper carbonation levels.</p>

<p>More Context:  Conventional wisdom says that for a beer to be truly ""cellar-worthy"", it must be unfiltered and bottle-conditioned so that the living yeast can continue to develop flavors in the beer as the years go by.</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I keg the beer, and later bottle just under half of the batch off of the keg, will the beer condition and mature in the same way when I cellar it?  </p></li>
<li><p>I'm assuming that if I force carb that too much yeast will be knocked out of suspension for it to mature in the same way--is this correct?  What's the scientific explanation?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm thinking that I'll add priming sugar to the keg, seal it up, let it carbonate naturally, and then bottle some time later.  Will this solve the force-carbing problem, assuming there is one?</p></li>

"Yeast or not to yeast, that is the question","<p>So this is the third year I am making home made wine from a combination of red (75%) and white(25%).

"Belgian Candi Sugar - CONFUSED!","<p>I've been reading about making some Belgian Candi Sugar for a Piraat (Belgian Tripel) recipe I want to make and finding some inconsistencies about the techniques. 
People talk about using citric acid and this is backed up in this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inverted_sugar_syrup</a> article and says cream of tartar is fine as well. I found mention that if you want clear BCS then just drop table sugar in the boil kettle and that heat will do the conversion... BUT the lowest temperature I've seen listed for triggering the conversion is 240°F (115°C) which won't be achievable. Stove top cooked sugar can reach these high temps though.</p>

<p>So I found <a href=""https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/the-how-to-for-making-belgian-candi-sugar.219960/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the-how-to-for-making-belgian-candi-sugar.219960</a> which leads to a PDF published by Beer Brewing Radio which states using Diammonium Phosphate which when I search online is described as a fertiliser but also is used as a Yeast Nutrient. Reading about it as a fertiliser I can see that there's an increase in pH over time, but how does it compare with the acidic levels of Citric acid or cream of tartar. </p>

<p>Can anyone say definitively which one I should use? I have cream of tartar in the pantry, but I'm not sure how much to use, the Beer Brewing Radio PDF says to use 1/2 tsp of DAP with 1 cup water and 2 lbs sugar, but how much cream of tartar of citric acid does that translate to? Is it worth just buy some Yeast Nutrient and follow this recipe to the letter?</p>

"Staggered sugar source addition: before or after racking?","<p>I am currently set up to use a modified <a href=""http://meadist.com/making-mead/mead-recipes/sparkling-oaked-acerglyn-maple-mead-recipe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recipe for a sparkling oaked acerglyn</a> with the following adjustments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reddit user Balathustrius's SNA schedule using Fermaid K, Fermaid O, and DAP</li>
<li>Additional honey added to the must prior to pitching</li>
<li>A bourbon soak to sanitize the oak spiral</li>
<li>1 gallon of apple cider added at some point during primary or secondary</li>
<li>Lalvin 71B yeast, which has an ABV tolerance of 14%</li>
</ul>

<p>Having analyzed the sugar content of the dark robust maple syrup, I found that the must would initially (based on step 2) have a relatively low specific gravity and might turn out somewhat dry. However, the recipe also calls for staggered addition of the maple syrup one week prior to racking. Would this second syrup installment be sufficient to somewhat back-sweeten the mead or would it trigger secondary fermentation and continue to be fermented into alcohol? I'm assuming since the maple syrup wouldn't appreciably change the volume of the must, the must is already approaching peak ABV and wouldn't change much despite the addition of sugar. However, I really, really want this recipe to be at least semi-sweet. Should I add more honey to the must initially or will the collective maple syrup / apple cider additions do the trick?</p>

<p>That said, when it comes to adding the apple cider, should I do this before (i.e., at the same time as the second syrup installment) or after racking? I have heard that in racking and ditching the collection of lee at the base of the carboy, 90-95% of the original yeast population is being removed. I fear that adding apple cider will heavily dilute the alcohol in solution without fermenting much if done so after racking. I don't mind some dilution, but by adding a gallon of apple cider the ABV could dive from 14% to 11.6% which I would ideally like to avoid.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to retain the sparkling aspect of this recipe. How long should I wait after the addition of the apple cider before pitching the corn sugar and bottling? Trying to avoid any bottle bombs if at all possible.</p>

<p>EDIT: Considering the already diverse flavor profile, I don't want to smother the finer notes with cider. How much cider is too much for a five gallon batch? Could I carbonate it using the cider alone?</p>

"Help identifying (and preventing) an off flavor","<p>I have had a recurring off-flavor in my ales that I would like help identifying and preventing. </p>

<p>The flavor is a yeasty flavor with some savory components. I have tasted it a few times in commercial beers, but usually it's less pronounced and fairly tolerable. In my homebrews, it can be overwhelming and I've even tossed a few batches because of it. Prior to fermentation (post sparge), the flavor is not there. It only appears after fermentation has started. It always accompanies an overproduction of trub, with more ""floaters"" than normal and more haze than normal. I can usually smell it right away, often times right after fermentation starts. It usually does not subside with bulk aging, but a few times it seems like the brew has become more tolerable after being kegged for a month or two. </p>

<p>It does not really match any of the <a href=""https://www.morebeer.com/articles/homebrew-off-flavors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">typical off-flavors</a>, but does almost have a blood-like component and sometimes a sulphur component. However, a metallic flavor ostensibly comes from metal equipment, not the fermentation, and sulfur from lagers... </p>

<p>I have never had this problem with sour beers, ciders or lagers, only ales, and I <em>think</em> always with S05, one packet for a typical SG of 1.050 - 1.060, most often rehydrated, sometimes directly pitched. I <em>thought</em> I had used a different yeast in the last one, but after looking at my notes, it was in fact, S05. I did buy a 6-pack of S05 a while back, so maybe the yeast was bad, but it seems like I have had this problem before I bought that pack, but maybe not as often. </p>

<p>Per jsolarski's comment, I did solicit some taste notes. Unfortunately, all I really got was a quick head turn, clearly noting the off flavor, but not really any good descriptions, except perhaps a bit salty. I don't pick up any salt flavors, but perhaps this comes from the savory notes. </p>

"Is there a benefit to a full 60 (plus) minute boil, as opposed to shorter boil/more hops?","<p>The idea is pretty simple: bittering due to alpha acid isomerization is a function of boil time and quantity of bittering hops.

<p>I'm a bit lazy, and I'd rather not steam up the house any more than I need to, so a shorter boil time definitely has an appeal.  Plus, it seems like more of the nice aromatics would be retained, which sounds like a win-win.</p>

<p>Doing a little research, I'm noticing that I see a decent amount of 15-minute American pale ale recipes popping up, almost at the exclusion of other, more malt-forward styles.  That's got me curious: </p>

<p><strong>Is there a benefit to a full-length boil, other than saving a few bucks on hops?</strong>  Is there something that happens on the malt side that takes time?</p>

"First Time - Honey Mead questions","<p>I am making Honey Mead for the first time soon, I will try making 2 1 gallon jugs. I have everything I need (Jugs, siphon, DAP, red star wine yeast, honey, sanitizer, carboy), but I want to make a sweet mead with about 15% ABV when fermentation is done. My yeast will survive up to 18% and I don't want to add chemicals to get them to stop at 13-15%. But I also want the mead to stay sweet afterwards. Should I just add enough honey and DAP for the yeast to survive to 15% ABV and then back-sweeten? If so, when am I suppose to back-sweeten it? Do I sweeten it after I rack it or right before? Also is there  way to make the yeast stop at 15% without chemicals? </p>

<p>EDIT: I also have a hydrometer, I have all the materials and tools required to make the mead, just confused on the procedure.</p>

"Is an ice bath sufficient to quickly cool a small batch of wort?","<p>I'll be brewing a small (1.5 gal) batch of beer soon, and in my quest for <del> laziness</del> <i>efficiency</i>, I was thinking of brewing in a smaller pot, rather than in my 7-gallon monstrosity.  However, my immersion chiller doesn't fit inside the small pot.</p>

<p>Would I be able to get sufficient chilling with an ice bath?  I'll be trying a more hop-forward brew, and I'd still like to retain as much aromatics as I can, so I'd like to cool it quickly.</p>

<p>Some napkin math makes it appear that the bottom &amp; sides of the small pot would have roughly 2/3 the surface area of the wort chiller, and would not have nearly the convective effects of flowing water through copper.

"How paranoid about cleaning & sanitization?","<p>I'm a new home brewer.  I only have a few batches under my belt -- one partial extract and two all grain.  Like most, I've read multiple books and watched videos on the brewing process.  Cleaning and Sanitization are talked about in depth.  In fact, it's talked about so much so that it has made me a bit paranoid.</p>

<p>On brew day, for example, I clean my equipment with PBW or Oxyclean, then sanitize.  I'm good with that, as I understand that this is best practices, and it doesn't take too long.  But, after I do that, say with a hydrometer, spoon, pitchers, etc.  Do I have to sanitize again every time I put it down?</p>

<p>I'm attempting to find a balance between doing the right thing for my beer but not obsessing about it where cleaning and sanitizing is something I dread, keeping me from brewing.  I find a lot of video on the right way to clean and sanitize, but none that actually talk about HOW careful you have to be.</p>

"Stalled fermentation","<p>I've started brewing an Oktoberfest. It has been in primary for a little less than a week.  The first 24 hours was good, super active.  After about a day,  it got pretty warm here,  and the thermometer strip on my carboy read 80°.</p>

<p>After that,  my fermentation came to a screeching halt.  I figured the warmer temp might have just sped up the fermentation process,  but when I took a gravity reading,  it said 1.022, my OG was 1.042. So it went down considerably in that time.  I decided to wait a few more days.  Today,  I read it and it's at 1.018. I wanted it down to 1.012 to 1.016ish.
And to be honest,  as I sat here writing this out it doesn't seems as bad as I thought it was.  </p>

<p>But,  Does this seem normal? Is this a normal rate?  Should I let it sit for a bit longer, or is this about as low as I can expect it to get? </p>

"How to reduce beer loss when dumping yeast using conical fementers?","<p>What are the key points to consider when using a conical fermenter to drain the yeast and leave only clean beer?
My goal is: removing yeast, with
(a) few loss of beer, (b) have beer not remain with yeast particles (potentially caused from the turbolences of the yeast removal process itself)?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Just some short time ago I bought a 115 liters conical bottom fermenter in stainless steel. A main intention of this purchase was to reduce both workload and losses of beer when it comes to separate the fermeted beer from the remaining yeast cake, before botteling.</p>

<p>Ideally there is a valve at the very bottom of the cone, which when opening should help to drain the yeast, leaving only beer (at best without causing any sort of ""cloudiness"" or ""haze"" from turbolences). <strong>Unfortunately it does never seem to be the moment, that all the yeast was removed.</strong> The liquid drained from the bottom valve, after being initially thick, quickly turns liquid, yet is still of a ""dirty with yeast"" color and NOT clear beer.</p>

<p>I guess something I do is not ideal.</p>

<p>Maybe it is crucial (cannot be done elsewise) to have the fermenter being chilled down to a certain temperature? (yet I would think that the yeast should always be at the bottom, from my experiences with other fermenters, even at not extra cold temps.)</p>

<p>Maybe to open the it lower ""yeast drainage valve"" to be opened, it is indispensable, to have the airlock of the fermeter removed, so that no pressure build up or air enters through the lower valve?</p>

"Adding store-bought juice to beer","<p>I've been toying with the idea of adding roughly a gallon of white grape juice to a beer (possibly a Belgian Blonde?) but was previously told that the juice will just be completely fermented out by the yeast, leaving me with a lighter bodied beer but with no flavor from the juice.</p>

<p>However, after researching cider more it seems that many people do ferment store-bought juice without issue. I've even found some references to people successfully adding juice to beer. So overall I'm a bit confused at this point.</p>

<p>I'm not necessarily looking for a huge fruity flavor in such a beer but I definitely want it to be noticeable. Have other people had success using store-bought juice in beer (or even cider)?

"Whirlpooling vs. Flameout (Knockout)","<p>I'm new to adding different hop additions after the boil.

And, if so, how do you actually create the whirlpool and for how long?</p>

<p>As an aside, with only 4 brews under my belt (2 all-grain, 2 partial extract), this seems to raise a red flag over the post boiled wort being exposed to the air.

<p>This means the final ABV will be in the 6-7% range instead of the 4-5% range. I like higher gravity beers, but I wonder if the higher than expected alcohol will put the intended balance of the beer out of whack. In other words, I assume the recipe was formulated such that the final alcohol flavors are milder, allowing, for example, more malt or hop flavors to come through.</p>

"Clarifying mead made from raw honey?","<p>I have a mead in secondary right now. It's been there for about three weeks. It spent two weeks in primary.

It's my first 5 gal batch and I wasn't planning to age it for months on end in the carboy, simply bottle it when it cleared because I want to make a sparkling mead and I'll need active yeast to do that. However, even after three weeks, it's still pretty cloudy with no real discernible amount of change towards clearing at all.</p>

<p>The honey itself is local and was decently filtered and only a little hazy. I've made two previous 1 gal batches with this same honey and simply left it in primary until bottling and they cleared wonderfully after about a month or so. I can still see some tiny bubbles at the surface. Is this evidence that fermentation is still slowly ongoing? I forgot offhand what my finished gravity was supposed to be, but I remember that I thought it was pretty spot on. So I don't know. I'm just wondering, will it ever clear on it's own? What kind of timeline am I looking at? Is this just the result of scale? Or will I have to resort to clarifying agents? Or, because I want sparkling, should I bottle soon to ensure the yeast is still active and it should clarify in the bottle?</p>

Most recipes I've seen close-ish to this use lower lovibond caramel malts and/or less roasted barley.  That said, some also use black barley, so I'm kind of at a loss for whether people just love burnt-tasting stouts or if I'm just over-estimating how much ends up in the beer.</p>

<p>After making the starter and pitching my yeast I started thinking about it more and realized this ratio much be off.  It turned out that the instructions for the first source only called for a cup but listed a pound in the supplies.  The second source was a typo which was corrected further down in the thread.</p>

<p>I decided that increasing the size of the starter was the best solution.  I had a 1 gallon jug on hand and decided that adding another liter of tap water would be a decent compromise between having way too large a starter and having one that was the right gravity.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it seems like I'm dealing with a half-gallon batch of moderate-to-high gravity beer rather than a true starter.  I should end up with way more yeast cells but I'm also going to stress the yeast more than I would have with an appropriate starter gravity.  As such, should I be concerned about pitching this starter?  If it's okay, would it make sense to split it off and keep a pint or so for a future batch or is the larger pitch rate just making up for the stressed yeast?</p>

you get bad stuff and it needs to be thrown. But what in my case when
ethanol is pure? Do I still need to throw them away (or mix with another

<p>Also if I want to have 70% alcohol at the end, do I need to add water to
still before distillation (ie. half-half so it is 49% abv mixture) so I can

"CO2 tank slowly losing gas, not sure where the problem lies","<p>So I have a rather simple keezer setup:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/etMg4.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The left keg is currently being force carbonated at 30 PSI.  The top keg is being kept shut off from receiving CO2.  The left keg's CO2 line is using a threaded CO2 keg adapter, I've ensured it is screwed on as tight as possible, maybe even too tight.  No beer is leaking anywhere, no audible gas can be heard escaping either keg... But...</p>

<p>The top keg is being kept cut off for a reason.  Initially, the tank mysteriously drained over the course of a couple of days, and the pressure left the keg entirely.  When I recharged the CO2 tank today and plugged it back in, ensuring the adapter to the keg was on properly, and turned the red lever, it wasn't receiving gas.  It sure sounded like it was, but the dial remained at 0.  As I fiddled with the gray dial that adjust the amount of pressure and the cut-off lever, I eventually got it to up in pressure to about 10 PSI in the keg, but no matter what I set it at, it continued to audibly take in CO2 indefinitely until I flipped the lever to cut off any further CO2 from coming in.  As I turn the dial back down to open it up, even after hours of letting it sit, it seems to still be at the pressure I left it at before (if not 2-5 PSI more?), yet it sounds like it's taking in more CO2.  I assume this is the reason for my question of:</p>

<p>Why is my CO2 tank slowly losing pressure?  I understand that as the tank gets colder, and colder, the pressure gauge indicating how much CO2 is left will drop, but by how much?  Currently, it crossed into the red on the dial (approximately 450 PSI, 50 below the ""re-fill"" line).  I know the pressure of the tank will decrease with temperature, but I currently have my keezer set to 38F (I'm in a hurry before tomorrow for that left keg).  I'm not sure how much I've lost to the top keg, but I left the shop with the tank at 800 PSI, and to have gone down almost by half seems a bit much.</p>

<p>My concern though is that even though I have the top keg cut off, am I still losing pressure elsewhere?  Why is it that this started happening in the last week?  I've ensured all tube cinches are cinched very tightly, all points where a wrench can tighten down parts are tightened very well, and both kegs seem to be holding their pressure, despite the top one audibly telling me otherwise.  Is having the tank at 450, down 350 from today's recharge plus losing a couple of minutes worth to the never-satisfied-top-keg normal?  Why would the top keg seemingly take in an infinite amount of CO2, yet retain whatever pressure I leave it at?</p>

<p>Also, I have not banged around the dual-gauge regulators, so I doubt it is in any way damaged.  I purchased it inside of a month ago, so it is still fairly new.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> It would appear that the CO2 has settled at the above mentioned PSI since last evening (approximately 10 hours now).  I'm guessing the top keg was the problem, and I lost a bit more gas than I wanted to by toying with it.  It has also held pressure throughout the night (or so the gauge says), and it still sounds like it's pushing pressure in when I open the cut-off.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE/REVISED QUESTION</strong>  So I gave the thing a pretty good StarSan spray-down.  I didn't see anything.  but I did notice that once I flicked the gauge, the pressure went from 15 down to about 3, so the gauge was a lie.  I continued to spray everywhere, and even went as far as to disconnect the gas line from the keg, and sprayed inside that, then put it back on.  After toying with the cut-off lever, and looking around, I started to hear bubbles bursting, ever so slightly.  I looked up, and caught one right before it burst, coming out of the connector on the gas line.  I disconnected it, cut out the o-ring, replaced it with another, even replaced the entire connector and hose (it was the first connector I had from when I first got into kegging a year ago).  Everything is cinched on tight, and still I can see bubbles and hear a slight hiss coming from the connector.  What are my options as far as this?  Do they sell random replacement parts?  Do I even need to replace that ball-lock on the keg?  Why is it that this is happening now?</p>

<p>At this point, I have maybe a gallon left.  I'm going to clean out a growler, save what I can of it, and try to drink the rest today/tomorrow as part of the American festivities.  Would be nice to try and salvage the keg though.</p>

<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Never mind the two hop bags that didn't sink, those things are more buoyant than what I gave them credit for.  This is the beer in a secondary vessel.  I wanted to get it off the yeast cake so I could wash the yeast (after realizing it was 9% ABV, I didn't bother, a bit much for the yeast, I fear).  It's been in this bucket for one week today.  It doesn't resemble a pellicle that you'd get from bacteria, but I'm getting hints from others that it may in fact be something even less pleasant to see.  Any chance this is some sort of beer-<a href=""http://www.foodrenegade.com/pics/kombuchascoby/kombuchascoby2.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SCOBY</a> in the making?  Maybe a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_cellulose"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bacterial Cellulose</a>?  Last night when I tasted it, it didn't taste off.  It smells like beer, and the film broke apart rather easily at this point.  Maybe it's my mind convincing my taste buds and nostrils it's good and I don't have my first infection after years of brewing without a single batch gone bad.  Any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I believe when I brewed it, I went overboard on the fining agents, adding an adequate amount of irish moss as well as one whirlfloc tablet.  Never tried both at once before, but figured I'd see how much of the protein I could get to settle out.</p>

"How precisely can you read your refractometer","<p>I do not have a refractometer and am considering buying one. My own concern is how precise you can get the readings. How many brix are you plus or minus when you do a reading? Is it as precise as a hydrometer, or close to? Do you still use a hydrometer for accurate readings before and after fermentation?</p>
"
"How to calibrate a refractometer","<p>What's the best method for calibrating a refractometer?</p>

<p>I've been using my cheapo refracto to take pre- and post-boil readings, but I also check with a hydrometer because I don't trust it yet. The two devices generally agree but usually the refracto is a couple of gravity points higher. The hydrometer has been checked as OK with distilled water and temperature adjustment is applied.</p>

<p>I have calibrated the refracto with distilled water as per the included instructions, but I'm wondering if there's more to it than that. Should I concoct a sugar solution of a predictable gravity to check non-zero calibration?</p>

"Fizzy with no head?","<p>My recent brew (#2) is well carbonated, but has little head to it when poured (and what's there dissipates quickly). Is it over carbonated? Too much priming sugar?</p>

"White Stuff -- is it bad?","<p>I just brewed a raspberry wheat w/ ~2.5 lbs of frozen (organic) raspberries added to the secondary. I waited about 23 days after adding the berries to bottle, and when I went down to the basement to get ready for bottling day, I found this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZqx7.jpg"" alt=""Bright white stuff on the color-drained raspberries""></p>

<p>Bright white stuff growing on the tops of a few of the raspberries. I had checked it maybe 24-48 hours prior, and there wasn't any that I noticed.</p>

<p>Sniff test came back fine, so I was just super careful when racking not to disturb any of it (since none of it was in the beer). Taste test from the bottling bucket was also nothing surprising (pretty good, actually), and the SG was 1.011 (including priming sugar, 5.5oz of cane in 2c of water).</p>

<p>So what is this stuff? Should I be worried about my bottles?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Day eight of bottle-conditioning at ~72˚F, and I just vented + dumped nine bottles that looked roughly like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TnqGt.jpg"" alt=""moldy bubbles?""></p>

<p>It may be equally difficult to see, but I expect this must be ""pellicle"" forming. Some bottles had white-covered bubbles, and others had some hazy stuff climbing up the neck from the beer line. All were pretty fizz-tastic when I popped the caps (just a little to let the pressure out at first), and one smelled particularly rubbery.</p>

<p>The other ~36 bottles looked good. Notably, I think it was the last few bottles out of the bottling bucket that were the worst; I had one half-bottle (the last few ounces out) that I capped out of curiosity; he fizzed worst than the rest. There were ""floaties"" in a few as well.</p>

"How do I avoid airlock foam overflow? Does it affect the fermentation process?","<p>During my last small batch brew, <a href=""http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/cascade-wheat-1-gallon-recipe-kit.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">American Wheat from Northern Brewer</a>, I came home to find that the foam in the 1 gallon carboy had overflowed the three-piece air lock (which was a mess to clean out). I have read that if it looks like it may bubble over, one can use a hose to create an airlock using a bowl of water. However, it overflowed while I was away, and I did not see it coming. I changed out the airlock for another one that I had, and let it proceed.</p>

"How long can a yeast starter stay on a stir plate before pitching?","<p>Two days ago (on Wednesday night) I made a yeast starter on my stir plate.

"After cleaning a bottle, what's an acceptable amount of leftover StarSan bubbles?","<p>I've been slowly improving my bottling, thank goodness.  I make a pot of warm / hot StarSan, and fill each bottle with the mixture, then after a while, turn each bottle upside down in the StarSan pot.  Then a few minutes later, I drain.</p>

<p>So far, I have ended up with a dense layer of small bubbles, about 1-2"" high, at the bottom of my 750mL bottles.  I know that leaving <em>some</em> StarSan behind is OK, but I wonder if I'm not doing a thorough job of draining?  And if not, how do I get a clean drain without rinsing?</p>

"First Time Airlock Won't Start","<p>EDIT: I see from this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/10309/murky-beer-no-bubbles-in-airlock"">post</a> and from elsewhere on the Web that a bubbling airlock is apparently not an indicator for fermentation, as there could be a leaky lid. Regardless, doesn't a non-bubbling airlock indicate that something is wrong, as there could be a leaky lid? I'm under the impression we use an airlock in the first place to keep air out as it would oxidize the alcohol into vinegar. </p>

<p>This was my seventh extract batch. For the last 4 batches I've done a yeast starter and aeration with an aeration stone. This has moved my lag time from 24 hours max to 12-16 hours max. For all my other batches I get a vigorous airlock for 4 days. Normally I pitch the yeast in the middle of the fermentation bucket and do NOT stir the yeast around. I normally order the Wyeast over the internet which takes 5 days to ship to me. I use a swamp cooler. Normally I wait until the airlock starts to bubble before I add frozen water bottles to the swamp cooler.</p>

<p>I bought the Creme Ale from NB which uses Wyeast 1056 (American Ale).</p>

<p>However, this was the first time I didn't order the Wyeast from NB; instead I purchased it from the LHBS because I figured the 5 day shipping from NB was harmful.</p>

<p>I also ordered a Dead Ringer IPA which uses the same yeast.</p>

<p>I made two yeast starters. The one for the Creme Ale had an OG of 1050 and the one for the IPA had an OG of 1040. The IPA definitely was a better yeast starter.</p>

<p>I aerated the creme ale wort (1040 OG) with an areation stone and pitched the entire 1050 yeast starter into it. This time I decided to stir up the yeast in the wort. This time I decided to put 6 frozen water bottles into the swamp cooler immediately instead of waiting until the airlock started bubbling. Using a temperature probe I kept the swamp cooler at 60*F by adding frozen water bottles. The lid was completely sealed.</p>

<p>After 24 hours the airlock was not bubbling, so I purchased another Wyeast 1056 from the LBHS and pitched it without a yeast starter at 48 hours. However when I opened the lid to the bucket I saw the following: (Is this fermentation activity or simply a result of me stirring the wort/yeast from 48 hours before?)
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CrDnd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Around 2 hours later (50 total) the air lock started bubbling, so I figured that I was safe and that either the 1050 og of the yeast starter somehow destroyed the yeast (even though I successfully pitched 1060 og yeast starters before) or the Wyeast I bought was bunk. I then added 6 frozen water bottles to the swamp cooler to take it to 60*F.</p>

<p>When I woke up 10 hours later (60 hours total) the airlock stopped bubbling.</p>

<p>I only did three things differently this time:</p>

<p>1) The LBHS sold me bad yeast.
2) The frozen water bottles somehow stopped the fermentation.
3) Stirring the yeast into the wort somehow did something.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>What is the problem (if it is possible to diagnose over the internet), and what should I do now?</p>

<p>I am in the middle of brewing the IPA with a 1040 og yeast starter so I will report back. This time I will simply pitch the yeast starter and not stir it, and I won't add frozen water bottles until I see the airlock bubbling.</p>

"Why does gravity increase between pre-boil and pitching?","<p>My handy-dandy ""Beer Craft"" book has a handful of recipes with useful information, including expected targeted pre-boil gravity, original gravity, and final gravity.  Their pale ale recipe, for example, calls out a pre-boil gravity of 1.035, original gravity of 1.055, and final of 1.012.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is... why does gravity increase from pre-boil to original?  </p>

<p>There's two things that happen here; you boil off some liquid, and you add hops.  You already have all your sugars from the malt.  My first thought was that it might be because you're increasing the density of sugars by losing water in the boil, but the ratio of liquid retention changes depending on batch size; I expect to lose about a gallon in an hour, regardless of whether I start with 2 gallons or 6; but the gravities stay the same.  My next thought was that the hops must affect the density, but what we keep from the hops after the boil doesn't go away as the beer ferments... or does it?</p>

<p>What's the science behind this?</p>

"How to Dry Hop when Forgoing Secondary Fermentation?","<p>I've decided to stop doing secondary-fermentations on the recommendation of users on this stackexchange. </p>

<p>A Dead Ringer IPA from Northern Brewer suggests 1-2 weeks primary, and 2-4 weeks secondary, with the last oz of Centennial being dry hopped in the secondary 1-2 weeks prior to bottling.</p>

<p>I'm worried about 2 things: </p>

<p>1) is a 6 week primary going to be ok -- will the yeast start to die at this point? (I did a yeast starter and areation)</p>

<p>2) Racking to secondary fermentation leaves the krausen behind. Do I simply drop the hop pellets onto the krausen and let them sink through? I don't want a bunch of holes in my krausen because I think I have a leaky lid on my fermentation chamber. Should I just get a filter and pop only one hole in the krausen, pouring the pellets through the filter, in order to minimize harm?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Fermentation started, then stopped the next day. Is my yeast dead?","<p>This is my first shot at homebrewing, using Northern Brewer's American Wheat Beer kit which is based on liquid malt extract, Willamette and Cascade hops, and a packet of dry yeast.  I brewed and put the hopped wort into fermentation on Friday.  By Sunday morning (~40 hours later), fermentation seemed to be moving along at a good clip -- I could see bubbles traveling through the airlock about once every 2 seconds.</p>

<p>However, by Monday morning, bubbling had completely stopped.  The weather (and my house) had gotten considerably cooler overnight, so thinking the cold was to blame, I moved the fermenter into the warmest room in the house (which still probably never goes over 70 Fahrenheit).  Still, no bubbling as of Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that fermentation should be vigorous for at least a few days.</p>

<p>I've been doing some research and realize now that when I was brewing I didn't really understand the importance of aerating the wort.  I shook it around for a minute or so in the fermenter on brewing day, but maybe that wasn't enough?  Also, I didn't realize until brewing day that I should have been keeping the dry yeast packet in the fridge/freezer -- it had been sitting out in my basement (60-75 Fahrenheit) for at least a month.  Oops.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on if I screwed something up or if there's a way to fix it (if it really needs fixed)?</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any help.  Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
At the suggestion of Denny (and some other homebrewers I talked to in person), I decided to just let the fermentation run its course and I'm happy to report that fermentation seems to have worked -- my original gravity was 1.041 (possibly slightly higher as the reading was taken warm) and after two weeks on bottling day I was at 1.016 = 60% attenuation (right?).  Although the Safale US-05 Ale Yeast I used doesn't give attenuation specs, some folks on a forum said they usually get at least 70% from that strain, so it's possible that fermentation might have been a little stunted from the yeast not being refrigerated.</p>

<p>The beer is conditioning in the bottles now, so hopefully it will taste good when I crack one open in a couple weeks.  Thanks everyone for all the input -- if nothing else I've learned the importance of taking good care of the yeast.</p>

"Stuck Ferm? Celebration Ale Clone Gravity at 1.021","<p>Celebration Ale Clone (extract kit)
White Labs California Ale Yeast (liquid vial, no starter, I know next time I'll make a starter)
Pitched at 68 degrees and good activity 18 hours later, got up to 71 degrees for the first 4 days of fermentation, but from days 5-10 its been around 64 degrees (house got cold and didn't have a temp control system) and the last 2 days have given gravity readings of only 1.021.
I aerated by pouring back and forth between the ferm bucket and bottling bucket and shook the bucket up before pitching, which is what I usually do and seems to work well for aeration on my other batches, but I did just order an O2 aeration system for my next batch.</p>

<p>I also did just get a Fermwrap and Johnson Digital Temp Controller to help in temp control during the colder months.
My question is would it work to swirl the bucket a bit to resuspend some of the yeast and use the Fermwrap to get the temp back up to 70 degrees to help it get down to a FG closer to the estimated 1.012?
I don't want to create any bottle bombs with a 1.021 gravity reading.
I contacted the store (Brewer's Apprentice in Freehold, NJ) where I get my kits and they weren't to sure if that would do anything, but shouldn't it help the yeast finish up since I feel like the yeast is probably just dormant from the colder temps? White Labs suggest 68-73 degrees.
Or is there anything else I can do to help it out?</p>

<p>(Side Note: Read in another post that scorched wort can create unfermentable sugars resulting in a higher FG, and yes I did slightly scorch my extract cause I left the heat on for a minute when adding it, so this may be the reason)</p>

<p>Finished my first brew from an extract kit, a Amber Ale. I added vanilla bean in secondary (4 whole beans) but followed the recipe to the tee. Beer finished and carbonated well. Its been in bottle for a little over 2 weeks. I finally refrigerated one last night and tried it.</p>

<p>Results are not promising. What I wanted was a mellow malty red ale, but it is way too bitter for my taste, almost like a weak IPA. The recipe I used called for bittering hops and aroma hops at the end. I am pretty sure next time I will cut the hops in half at minimum.</p>

<p>Also, I was worried the four whole vanilla beans I put in wouldn’t be enough to change the flavor profile, but I was way wrong, its too much vanilla. The flavor is good on impact to the tongue, but the vanilla leaves an odd after taste that I can’t really describe.</p>

<p>Question #1 - What is the best way to kill some of the bitterness and let the caramel malt flavor shine through? Simply half the amount of hops?</p>

"How to salvage bottled beer that failed to carbonate","<p>I brewed my first batch of kit beer that required a kind of ""secondary fermentation"".  That is after it was done fermenting I transferred it to another carboy and added the bourbon barrel wood chips. After 4 weeks, bottled it with recommended priming sugar.  This is my first failure in brewing beer.     </p>

<p>After over 3 weeks it has no/zero fizz.  The beer is ok but without the co2 it is not good.  Any ideas on:</p>

<ol>
<li>What went wrong? What killed the yeast?  </li>
<li>How to salvage it?  Rebottle it?  Buy a keg and co2 system and pour it in?</li>

"Hydrometer measures and possible corrections","<p>In my first batch I was very worried about not being able to end it by not having certaing equipment at the right time. The thing is by following strictly the instructions my hydrometer reading was very close to the one predicted in the recipe. But after that I thought to myself 'why i did buy this.. i wouldn't be able to take any correction measure if it wasn't right' So, if the hydrometer it's far from the ideal density in the mashing process what could be done? And one thing related to that. If the reading shows that density it's very close to water and so you want to increase the levels of sugar in the content by increasing temperature (or cooking time), could you eventualy 'burn' your mash? Or you will only lose water? <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: i thing for the sake of not getting to vague in the question is better to focus on the appropriate measures for the mash process, fermenting density and other stages could be done in another topic</p>

"Bottling vs Kegging Questions","<p>One thing that is very confusing to me right now is the difference between bottling and kegging, more specifically the carbonation difference between them. The first doubt of kegging  arises when you would extract the beer inside of it. You could use a party pump or a co2 cylinder system. But if you used a party pump wouldn't the beer be flat? Like you add sugar when priming to generate co2 and etc. I understand that this is emulated by the co2 cylinder when kegging. But if it is already carbonated why would you use co2? Is the beer inside of a keg really 'flat'? I think to better address the question would be important to explain in what stage (primary, secondary fermentation, .. ) the beer in commercial kegs are. Thanks!</p>

"Stupidly added priming sugar in initial fermentation step","<p>I started my first brew this weekend with a kit, </p>

<p>Stupidly, I misread the instructions and added the bag of priming sugar (which was supposed to be added immediately prior to barrelling) at the start of the fermentation. (I got confused with a brewing sugar step which was including in the instructions but intended for a different recipe - it was a bit unclear!)</p>

<p>After a slow start it's now bubbling away and smells good (2 days later), and my plan is to just wait the given amount of time and then take a gravity reading. Hopefully it'll reach the correct gravity and I just proceed to barrel it as-per the instructions. Maybe I should take one reading and then another the day after to check that it's stable.</p>

"How do I increase the sulphur production in a lager?","<p>In my past experience, my lagers have no perceptible sulphur. I understand that the ""rotten egg"" sulphur (H2S) is undesirable, but every great lager I have tasted has at least a hint of matchstick sulphur (SO2), sometimes fairly pronounced. I found a lot of articles on how to remove it or mitigate it, but little to nothing on how to produce it. </p>

<p>I have tried different fermentation temperatures (low 40Fs to mid 50Fs), but they all taste the same to me; rather bland and ""un-lager-ish"". I have tried different yeasts (<a href=""https://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=30"">wy2124</a>, <a href=""https://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=26"">wy2007</a>, <a href=""http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp830-german-lager-yeast"">wlp830</a>, but mostly use <a href=""http://www.fermentis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SFG_W34pdf.pdf"">w34/70</a> (<a href=""http://www.mrmalty.com/yeast.htm"">which I believe is perhaps the same as wlp 830/wy2124</a>). I have also tried <a href=""https://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=34"">wy2278</a>, but it's been a while. I actually purchased this for my next lager because it specifically mentions sulphur production. </p>

<p>I normally make a starter, using DME and size by the numbers from <a href=""http://www.mrmalty.com/calc/calc.html"">Mr. Malty</a> (or pitch 2 packs of w34/70). I also usually chill the starter and decant before I pitch it, so I don't get too much DMS from the starter. I've even tried fermenting the starter at lager temps, though it didn't seem to have any perceptible difference. </p>

<p>My ""usual"" technique is the one described in Palmer's introduction to Jamil's ""Brewing Classic Styles"", page 43, where the wort is chilled to 7C before pitching, then raised to 10C over the next 3 days. I certainly don't do everything right every time, but like I said, my lagers just don't have that classic taste I get from nearly every craft lager. </p>

<p>If you have any recommendations or corrections to my technique, it would be greatly appreciated. Lagers are a style I have yet to even pull off, much less master :)</p>

"What stainless steel inox 304 vs inox 316 is acceptable for brewing equipment?","<p>I am setting together fittings and ball valves for my homebrewing equipment and corrosion protection and food safety of material is a key decision point.</p>

<p>Yet there is a noticable price difference between the inox 304 (cheaper) and inox 316 (more expensive) stainless steel. I seek in this question the information where the difference between the two is, in particular with wort.</p>

<p>The key points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>will 304 suffer (i.e. corrode) from wort (assuming there is sort of <s>salts</s> chloride existing in the wort) ?</li>
<li>will the 304 type of stainless steel (in case of corrosion) release any toxic materials into the wort ?</li>
<li>can the price difference (i.e. that 304 is 1/2 as expensive as 316) be confirmed?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have read this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>304 stainless steel has a high resistance to rust. It withstands
  corrosion from most oxidizing acids and is often used for kitchen and
  food applications. However, it is susceptible to corrosion from
  chloride solutions (notably saline environments with high amounts of
  sodium chloride). Chloride ions can create localized areas of
  corrosion, called ""pitting,"" which can spread beneath protective
  chromium barriers to compromise internal structures. Solutions with as

"To Keg or not to Keg","<p>I've got a very lovely and quite potent American IPA that I've brewed several times now, from experience I know it'll get down to 1.006 in about 2 weeks if the temp is ideal.</p>

<p>The brew has been in for 2 weeks but as the ambient temperature has dropped so much it's only at 1.010 so not yet complete.</p>

<p>now my question! I either keg today or leave it for 2 weeks while I'm away, will it be ok on the yeast for another 2 weeks or should I just keg knowing that it's not yet complete? (my pressure keg should keep it at 15 psi)</p>

<p>Further question, if I do keg should I add the priming sugar or trust that the pressure that's inevitably going to be there from continued fermentation will be enough to carbonate?</p>

<p>I'm such a noob at this stuff.</p>

"How is fermentation affected by a long boil?","<p>When making our seasonal beer we ended up getting a pre-boil gravity sample that was way higher than expected, so we added water to dilute the mash. A new sample was taken and the first one must have been polluted because now we ended up with a to low gravity. </p>

"Does homebrewed beer have a ""Golden Age""?","<p>In August I brewed my very first batch ever, an Amber Ale from Brewer's Best (kit). Six weeks later, I opened up the first bottle and was astonished - it tasted pretty darned good!</p>

<p>Over the course of September and October I drank almost all the bottles, and had about 6 left coming into November.</p>

<p>This past weekend, I hadn't drank one in about 2 or 3 weeks, and so I cracked one open. I poured it into a glass, and it looked totally normal. Good head on it, no visible particles/""floaters"", etc. But when I went to taste it, it was <em>super</em> strong (alcohol), and after a few sips I tossed it.</p>

<p>I opened a second one - same thing. A third one, same thing.</p>

<p>My <em>theory</em> is that the yeast have been fermenting inside my bottles this entire time, and that the brew's ""sweet spot"" (that is, where taste and alcohol content were perfectly balanced) or Golden Age was back in September and October. And that now we've past that Golden Age and there is simply too much alcohol in the bottles now to be enjoyable.</p>

<p>So I ask: <strong>Is my theory correct? If not, what the heck is going on? And if so, is there anything a homebrewer can do to correct it or prolong a bottled beer's ""Golden Age""?</strong></p>

<p>Previous incarnation of this ale was using no DME and 8kg Pale Ale (rest unchanged) and it was delicious. I decided to substitute 3kg of malt with 2kg of DME to only sparge once. </p>

<p>Problem is, it turns out that I only have 3.5kg of Pale Ale. I'm 1.5kg short. Possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy more. More authentic taste, but sparge will be long. </li>
<li>Buy DME or LME. Easy sparge, bad for pocket. Taste impact? </li>
<li>Use more Munich I and II. Cheapest, I already have it. But would alter the flavor. On the other hand, it's supposed to be malty. </li>

"First brew - OK to substitute malt/hops, and how much water should I be boiling?","<p>I've been reading John Palmer's <em>How to Brew</em> and I'm getting ready for my first brew day in a few days. I'm aiming to follow the basic 'Cincinnati Pale Ale' recipe that he provides but I'm going to have to substitute some ingredients and I'm just wondering if it will be OK to do this. </p>

<p><strong>His recipe:</strong></p>

<p>OG = 1.045, 30 IBUs</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5kg pale malt extract syrup, unhopped</li>
<li>1.1kg amber dry malt extract</li>
<li>6 AAUs bittering hops</li>
<li>5 AAUs finishing hops</li>
<li>packet dry yeast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My proposed changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Malt: 1.8kg amber liquid + 1kg pale dry</li>
<li>Hops: Just one variety of the local 'Cascade'-style hop.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Will I have to compensate in any way for the malt changes? I understand people target different OGs/IBUs for the style they want, but will this be OK to produce a first brew?</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding hops, mine are 7.3% AA so I'm thinking I'll use 6AAUs of them for bittering and probably none for finishing in order to keep it simple. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, or should I use some for finishing in order to get more AAUs? </p></li>
<li><p>In terms of boiling the wort, I have a 50L aluminium pot - should I boil the whole amount of water (~20L) with the malt and hops in it, or should I do what Palmer does in his recipe and only boil part of the final volume, adding the rest into the fermenter? I'm a bit confused about why he wouldn't boil all the water and ingredients together as I thought that produced a better wort, but I've also read that some people only boil small amounts of water and then add it to the rest in the fermenter...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is probably a bit weird but I'm not experienced enough to know what will just 'work'. I'm not that worried about what will be 'best' - just trying to get a first brew out that tastes like a decent beer and doesn't fail. Thanks in advance for reading and responding.</p>

"When to add sugar to big belgian ale?","<p>I'm brewing a cross between <em>Belgian Dark Strong</em> and <em>Barleywine</em>. Currently it is it's third day. Starting gravity was ~26 Brix (~1.11 Specific Gravity). I want to push it up with candi sugar, muscovado, dry demerara sugar and caramel. I'll need almost 2kg of these for the effect I want (30 Brix).</p>

<p>Now, I want my yeast to ferment most malt sugars before I'll add simpler ones. There are <a href=""http://howtobrew.com/book/section-1/fermentation/wort-factors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources</a> suggesting that yeast may lose ability to ferment maltose if there is too much simple sugars available. But I don't want to wait for yeast to go dormant either - I'm pushing it 2 percent points above yeast strain alcohol tolerance, so I need them to be active and plentiful.</p>

<p>So, when should I start adding sugar? What should I look for?</p>

"Used Wrong Yeast.... Final Gravity Too High","<p>I am considering two techniques for lowering my specific gravity but am unsure if my methods will work. I am currently fermenting a bock style. It's not a true bock because I don't have the ability to lager, so I used an ale yeast, specifically, Safbrew T-58, per a friend's recommendation. </p>

<p>My original gravity was 1.071. After taking 5 measurements over the course of a week, the gravity has stopped at 1.025. I was hoping for it to be a little lower, but I became concerned when I read this yeast may not be ideal for high alcohol brews. Temperature has been ideal according to package. I can't do much about room temperature anyway because my brewery is a spare bedroom in my house. My conclusion is that fermentation is not prematurely stuck, it's just the yeasties are are maxed out and done all they can do.</p>

<p>I bought some nutrients and a pack of Safale K-97 dry ale yeast which said ""high attenuation"" on the package. I don't want to make a whole starter and repitch because I'm worried that will void out my previous SG readings.</p>

<p>So here is my question. Can I just agitate the wort a bit and repitch the new yeast with the nutrients (without making a starter)? Do I need both or can I just add one of them? Should I be satisfied with this? I feel that the beer is too sweet right now. Primary fermentation finished almost three weeks ago.</p>

"How Much (and How Fast) of a Drop in Temperature can (Ale) Yeast Tolerate? (And Preliminary Results from My Experiment)","<p>I have rigged up <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/10166/3345"">a Raspberry Pi with some DS18B20 temperature probes</a> that measure both the water in the swamp cooler and <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/10326/3345"">the beer directly</a> and store the results in a MySQL database. </p>

<p>I brewed a new batch on 7/18, and fermentation began on 7/19, from which I have put varying amounts of frozen water bottles into the swamp cooler on 8 occasions.</p>

<p>Here is the pattern I have currently noticed for adding frozen water bottles during primary fermentation (the patters may well change after the primary fermentation due to the lack of exothermic reaction present):</p>

<pre><code>1) The water in the swamp cooler reaches its minimum temperature in about one hour.
2) The fermenting wort reaches its minimum temperature in about two hours.
3) The wort maintains its minimum temp + 1°F over the next two hours, very slowly working
    its way back up over the course of 5 hours after reaching its minimum
4) Both swamp and wort temperatures tend to equalize in three hours.
5) The temperature drop in the wort is roughly 40-60% of the temperature drop in the swamp
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now my main question is how much of a drop of temperature, in how fast of a time period, can yeast tolerate without dropping out? (Ale in particular, but Lager too if you know the answer). Would starting temperature also factor in--i.e., if starting temp was 75 and minimum temp was 70, would that be different than starting 70 minimum 65?</strong></p>

<p>For example, on my first attempt the wort's temperature was 70.250°F. By placing three frozen water bottles in the swamp cooler, the wort's temperature dropped to 65.861°F in two hours.</p>

<p>On another attempt, the wort was initially 69.350°F, and three frozen water bottles dropped it to 65.412°F in two hours.</p>

<p>On another attempt, the wort was initially 69.125°F, and four frozen water bottles dropped it to 64.850°F in two hours.</p>

<p>On another attempt, the wort was initially 67.212*F, and four frozen water bottles dropped it to 63.162*F in two hours.</p>

<p>On another attempt, the wort was initially 68.100*F, and five frozen water bottles dropped it to 65.600*F in two hours (Interesting, smaller drop this time)</p>

<p>On another attempt, the wort was initially 67.230°F, and five frozen water bottles dropped it to 61.800°F in two hours.</p>

<p>Two hours ago the wort was 67.200°F, and five frozen water bottles have dropped it to 62.967°F.</p>

<p>In the future I will be posting graphs comparing the wort to the swamp with the number of frozen water bottles if anyone else is as interested in this as I am.</p>

<p>My question is: ""why is this important?"" Is the only purpose of calculating starting and finishing gravity to relate how much alcohol content the beer has to another individual looking to make beer from your recipe? If so, why can't one simply measure the starting and finishing gravity when first making the recipe (since undoubtedly the only way to determine if a recipe is good is to make it at least once), and then relate this to others?</p>

"Is a yeast-starter without temperature control worse than no yeast-starter at all?","<p>EDIT: Crap, it appears I mislead myself. Northern Brewer includes a temperature range of the particular Wyeast you are using, and I assumed this temperature range factored out off-flavors. I read on this stackexchange that it is a good idea to let the temperatures rise after the initial 3-5 days of fermentation. I assumed this meant to the top of the temperature range specified by NB/Wyeast. My Belgian Ale I allowed to go roughly 78*F during the day times. My Cream Ale I allowed to go specifically 71-72*F nearly round the clock. Regardless, I enjoyed this discussion and learned something about yeast starters and temperature!</p>

<p>I have used a yeast starter for my last 3 batches. Two of these batches are bottle conditioning for carbonation, but I took two of them out to test a few days ago.</p>

<p>They were so full of esters that my neighbor referred to the first one as ""Bananna Beer"", and the second one as ""Strawberry Beer"".</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>One of the batches that I am annoyed about in particular was a Belgian Trippel that took about 6 weeks (+2 weeks bottle conditioning) and required a secondary, and was the most expensive extract I've bought so far. The other batch was a creme ale that took 2 weeks (+ 2 weeks bottle conditioning).</p>

<p>I've never had the fruity-beer problem because I've done a fantastic job at controlling temperature with a swamp cooler.</p>

<p>However, I can't use a mini-swamp cooler with my yeast-starters, as my home-made stir-plate can't hang.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1) Is fruity flavoring always and everwhere a side effect of high-temperature and ester production, or may sanitation problems also generate fruity flavoring?</p>

<p>2) If fruity flavoring is always and everwhere formed by high-temperatures, is it better to forgo a yeast starter if it is not possible to control the temperature of the yeast starter? I also figured that maybe a 12 hour yeast starter at night time would be better than 72 hours in higher heat.</p>

The pulp was then pressed using a press (both the mill and press are similar to the ones depicted <a href=""https://www.manomano.co.uk/picking-and-harvesting-tools-3866?model_id=3474591&amp;g=1&amp;referer_id=685564&amp;ach=a778d&amp;achsqrt=d94f0&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA8f_eBRDcARIsAEKwRGc3QzmMKrnu6_62TQu8ocKhcsyGfp3KarmUwxdcpCCdp5FD0Zm3I8waAmy3EALw_wcB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> - apologies for the link to a commercial site but I don't have pictures readily at hand).</p>

<p>One thing to note: I thought the flesh of the apples seemed a little drier than some juicy eating apples I've had before. I'm wondering how much a role the type of apple play in the conversion ratio. The apples I got were a mix of ""seconds"" from a local orchard, mostly eating apples that were discarded due to cosmetic issues.</p>

<p>What can I do to get more juice out of the apples? I'm open to all suggestions but have a preference for non-electric means. I'm aiming to get closer to the 2/1 (kg/l) ratio that seems to be achievable using standard methods.</p>

"What exactly is krausen (and why does this batch not have much)?","<p>...and as a followup, how much should I care?</p>

<p>I've always used krausen presence as a rough indicator of fermentation vigor in primary.  But my current batch hardly has any, with a few days at never more than a half inch.  It's definitely going, with a bubble every few seconds from the airlock.  However, it was a slow start (almost 24 hrs before activity) and it's never felt like it was going too strong. </p>

<p>But it got me thinking: <strong>what exactly is krausen, and how reliable an indicator is it of fermentation health?</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>As a matter of interest, this is what I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 gallons (ferm vessel is a 3-gal carboy)</li>
<li>2 lbs light DME</li>
<li>1 oz Cascade - 30 min @ 160F</li>
<li>2/3 oz Cascade - 15 min @ 160F</li>
<li>US-05 (a full packet)</li>
<li>current temp is about 65F</li>
</ul>

<p>Some possibilities I can think of for why krausen is less on this batch:</p>

<ol>
<li>No boil = proteins coagulated differently than I'm used to</li>
<li>I poured the wort through a strainer instead of siphoning</li>
<li>Light &amp; simple wort = less proteins than I'm used to?</li>
<li>Slow start = bad yeast?</li>
<li>...though some people say US-05 can work slowly in general</li>
<li>Yeast is a living thing, thus every batch behaves differently, RDWHAHB.</li>
</ol>

"Do I have to bottle my wine immediately after stopping the fermentation?","<p>I have a gallon of very sweet kiwi wine. I've racked it twice already but after couple months in at it's current stage it still hasn't cleared. I want to let it sit in the carboy until it does clear but at the same time I don't want it to continue getting stronger (the wine is very sweet so there is plenty of sugar still to be eaten and for some reason the yeast seems to be pushing well beyond its nominal tolerance of 14% ABV).</p>

<p>Is it ok for me to stop the fermentation now (with campden tablets and Potassium Sorbate) but leave the wine in carboy for a few more months until it clears? Or will it spoil? If that's OK, should I sterilise with Campden tablets once more before bottling to prevent spoilage?</p>

"Priming solution or add sugar to individual bottles?","<p>From what I've read, it seems that the old technique of adding a given amount of sugar to each bottle for priming isn't recommended anymore.  Instead, just about every source recommends boiling priming sugars in water and adding the cooled solution to the wort before bottling.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this?</strong>  It seems to me that by adding sugar to individual bottles, I don't have to worry about uneven carb levels from a non-uniform mixture of my priming solution.</p>

<p>Reasons I've thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Convenience: not having to measure out the sugar for 50 bottles</li>
<li>Convenience: not having to worry about bottles with different volumes</li>
<li>Sanitation: the sugar gets pasteurized (is this really a concern?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there other compelling reasons I haven't thought of, or does it just come down to convenience?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: This motivation for this question was bottling small batches, in which priming just a few bottles is an equivalent amount of work to batch priming.</p>

"Low FG due to cacao nibs?","<p>I recently brewed an oatmeal cream stout from the Mashmaker book (recipe here <a href=""https://growlermag.com/homebrew-recipe-oatmeal-cream-double-stout/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://growlermag.com/homebrew-recipe-oatmeal-cream-double-stout/</a>) with the intention of adding some chocolate &amp; hazelnut flavours.</p>

<p>Main difference initially is that I added some cacao nibs to the mash.</p>

<p>I hit the OG, however the FG has come out at 1.032, rather than the expected ~1.015...</p>

<p>I had read the yeast I was using is highly flocculant, so I pitched some more after 2 weeks, to no avail. Fermentation schedule looked like - </p>

<ul>
<li>Day 0 - 18C, pitched 1 smackpack 1318 London 3 yeast</li>
<li>Day 6 - 21C, roused yeast, gravity 1.032</li>
<li>Day 13 - 21C, still 1.032, added 1 pack dry Garvin/Nottingham yeast</li>
<li>Day 17 - still 1.032</li>
</ul>

<p>For completeness, I scaled this down to an 11L brew:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maris otter   2240g</li>
<li>Flaked Oats   263g</li>
<li>Roasted malt (blackprinz) 230g</li>

<li>Cacao nibs (secondary)    98g</li>

"Ginger Beer ABV from Bakers Yeast","<p>I’ve made ginger beer a few times. I usually make it with just fresh ginger and raw honey. Usually the I get well less than 2% ABV. 
This last week though I used a different honey, sourced from a farm, it was really raw and had a distinctly wild honey smell. 
After making the cordial and allowing to cool I mixed with water in my brewing vesseI and used 12g ~ 0.42 oz of bakers yeast, I made roughly 6GAL / 20L worth. 
IG = 1.046 and after 4 days, SG was 1.014 !!

"Affordable cooling solutions","<p>I have been advised that controlling fermentation temperature is the first thing I should do to try and improve the quality of my beer.</p>

<p>I gather I can get a temperature controller (such as the one from Inkbird) and plug this into a cooling device - but what would this device be?</p>

<p>I've seen the following suggestions so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put the fermenter in a water bath, possibly with a t shirt wrapped around it to act as a ""wick"" (I've seen this called swamp cooling). This may achieve lowering the temperature below ambient (although I don't know enough thermodynamics to understand why) but still offers no fine control - seems like all it achieves is an unknown decrease in mean temperature and maybe a little less fluctuation.</li>
<li>Buy a fridge. I've not been able to find a mini fridge which would fit more than a single demijohn in it. A full sized fridge is impractical and expensive.</li>
<li>Invest >£1000 in a sophisticated glycol cooling system from somewhere like Ss Brewtech.</li>

"Kegging and dispensing over distance/elevation using keg pressure or something else","<p>A few years ago I set off to turn my kitchen dry bar into a wet bar by routing beer from my kegerator to the taps 10 or so feet above.  I was advised against it by some employees at my local home brew store who said that I'll just end up with a lot of foamy warm beer.  As a result I built a bar on casters over a kegerator, which was admittedly pretty awesome, but still less integrated than I'd like and really bulky.  I just moved and I'd really like to build that actual bar I had been planning years ago.  Based on a 10 foot rise, and assuming that rise is 100% exposed I estimate a 4.3 psi pressure drop assuming there is no transfer pump being used.  Also, it appears about 1.8 ounces of beer would be exposed to warmer climates outside the kegerator.  possibly more due to horizontal runs but it will also be run in interstitial space where there is no heat.  </p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>How do real bars do it?  Do they actually use refrigerated lines and transfer pumps?</p>

<p>What if the runs are small? (assuming the runs are &lt; 20')</p>

<p>Does anyone see this being a problem if I use insulated beer line and just keep my serving PSI at ~15-16?  I generally serve in the low 40's (good beer doesn't need to be 32 degrees), so I need 15-16 psi to keep ~2.5 volumes over time anyway.</p>

I assumed this would be dry enough that it would halt further fermentation, but 48 hours later the airlock is still bubbling at a period of about 18.3 seconds. Shining a light through the must shows fine bubbles rising to the top. I’m going to take another SG reading soon to see if there’s been any further changes, but do you think this would be safe to backsweeten without serious complications?

However, my main concern is that on tasting it, it is a bit bitter. Is it best just to leave it for a bit and see if it mellows, or could I add a bit more sugar at this stage to sweeten it up a bit?

<p>Make a few mistakes:<br>
 - Got impatient and pitched yeast around 78/79°F, wort had stratified temp wise, top was much cooler than bottom (where I was reading), since I had used a concentrated boil.<br>
- Didn't aerate as much as I could have before pitching.  Thought this might be okay, since I used tap water in the carboy, sparged the wort into it, then topped it off, but in retrospect, maybe not.<br>
-Stupidly, did not take a hydrometer reading before pitching yeast.  </p>

<p>Anyway, for the past three days gravity has been stuck at 1.021, when the recipe says to expect to get to around 1.010 - 1.014.  I can live with the difference in ABV, but I don't want to bottle with unfermented material in there and make grenades.  So my question is:  should I stir this batch and possibly raise the temp (currently 68°F) to get the yeast going or am I just being paranoid, the batch is done, I should bottle and condition it now?  Am I over-thinking this?  At any rate, I learned a lot of lessons about paying attention to temperature, taking readings, etc, so I don't think it's a loss either way.</p>

"Kegging home brew","<p>I have a Cornelius system and I'm wanting to keg my home brew. </p>

<p>I'm curious if you need to prime the beer to help with carbonation or if you just add wort to keg and carbonate from co2? </p>

"Hop utilization","<p>I've been thinking, especially after brewing my last IPA, about getting the most out of my hops.  The higher the SG of your wort, the less you get from your hops, so the more you have to put in.  I've been thinking about boiling a seperate gallon of water while my beer is cooking and throwing half of my hops or more into the seperate one gallon of plain water with a specific gravity of 1.000.  This will allow me to get the most out of my hops, then after 55 minutes or so, I'll poor this into my boiling wort.</p>

<p>Will this work?  Does boiling the hops seperate from the wort have a drawback that I'm not aware of?  I'm sure that there is some interaction between the wort and the hops during the boil that I'm missing.  I'm curious though.</p>

"Cold Break with a False Bottom","<p>Historically, I've cooled my wort with a immersion chiller and siphoned it off to the carboy once it gets down to a reasonable temperature.  I recently installed a false bottom and ball valve.  This works well and the elbow attached to the ball valve avoids most of the hop material (whole leaf), but I am seeing a good bit of cold break going into the carboy, which i could avoid with the siphon.  Am I missing something here?  Would whirl pooling work (i'd think not, since the material would just collect in the center of the false bottom and go through the screen)?</p>

<p>I don't have a huge problem with the cold break, but my main purpose of installing the false bottom was to limit the trub from transferring.</p>

Move them to a cooler part of the house?  The priming calcuator I used has an input for ambient temp, which I put in at 65 degrees (though my house has been closer to 68).

"Fruit Beer Question (use of fig and style recommendation)","<p>I am trying to brew a beer for my brother's 50th birthday in late April (who had a large part in getting me into homebrewing, though he has since hung it up).  He is a huge fan of figs, so I thought I would try to incorporate them into a brew.  Typically, he's into the hoppy end of balanced beers (not particularly into complex malt-profiled beers, porters/bitters, etc.), and can get into some mega-hopped beers.  </p>

<p>I brewed a fig-gose by adding 12oz of pureed fresh figs to the boil @ 5min, along with the coriander and salt.  It was somewhat of an experiment, since I felt like I had some time to mess around before I needed to deliver the batch.  The finished product is good, drinkable, but a bit cidery, i'm guessing because the majority of the fig sugars fermented out.  A couple of questions/requests for advice:</p>

<p>1.)  Should I stick to a simpler style such as a Gold/Blonde/Cream Ale since my bro isn't really into lambics/wits, etc. that might be more receptive to a fig?  Maybe I could brew another gose and add figs to a secondary, as I thought the style would work well (below-threshold saltiness with a fig essence to balance -- my understanding is traditionally this style can be served with fruit syrups)</p>

<p>2.)  Should I addand simply add the figs/fig puree to the secondary to get more of the fig essence?  I was somewhat worried about sanitization which is why I added them pre-fermentation.  Any ideas on how to sanitize the figs?  Boil a puree then cool?</p>

<p>3.)  Any suggestions on a more suitable style?</p>

"Temperature Swings While Bottle Conditioning/Carbonating","<p>I brewed a GLBC Christmas Ale Clone in November, trying (futilely) to have it ready for Xmas Eve.  Had it in bottles two weeks before, but to no avail. As this beer finished up around 9.3%abv, the yeast in the bottles had a lot more work to do given the boozy conditions inside the bottles.  </p>

<p>After 5 weeks in the bottles (ambient temp in my house is around 65 degrees), and virtually NO carbonation (despite my priming sugar calculation on Tastybrew.com), I found a spot that generally stays 70 degrees or warmer:  a shelf above my dryer in the laundry closet.  Shook the cases really well, stored them up there, and was able to be patient enough to forget about them for exactly one week.</p>

<p>After one week up there, I noticed significantly more carbonation.  A much more pronounced 'hiss' when opened the bottles, plus about a half inch, quickly-dissapating head.  Also, there was good carbonation in the first few sips, giving way to a flatter beer by the end of my bottle sample.  </p>

<p>A few questions:</p>

<p>1.)  When the dryer is running, it can get up to 75-78 degrees in that spot.  When it isn't, it is usually around 70.  Are these swings harmful to the beer?</p>

<p>2.)  Since there was no carbonation for so long, does this simply 'reset the clock' for carbonation?  In other words, the louder hiss tells me there is a lot of CO2 in the headspace, but will this dissolve into the beer?  Not to be a maniac, but I am looking to get the nice, soft carb bubbles that you get from a well-conditioned beer (they help make the alcohol heat more palatable!)</p>

<p>3.)  At a certain point, will I see any benefit from cellaring the beer at 60-65 degrees?  Given the ABV of this one, I am hopeful that it will age well.  When would you all start the cellaring process?</p>

<p><strong>I'm thinking to leave them up there for two more weeks, then stick them in a cool corner of the cellar to age, let the flavors meld, and the alcohol mellow out.</strong>  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.  This is my first really big beer (1.093 OG), and I realize that these are not for the impatient.  I'm just curious as to how best to get this beer into its prime.  </p>

"Bottling high Alcohol beer","<p>I have been researching this on some blogs and have seen info on this topic but not an answer to this question. I have brewed a 10.6% Belgian tripel with an FG of 1.02 about 6 weeks ago (secondaryed at 2 weeks). The yeast I used is Wyeast Belgian Abby which is good to about 12%. I have read that due to the higher ABV I should think about repitching yeast a day or two ahead of time. I have seen a lot of suggestions to use champange yeast due to its alcohol tolerance. My question is this: If I use a different yeast shouldn't I be worried that the new yeast may consume the residual sugar as well as the bottling sugar, thus not only changing my flavor profile but making bombs as well?</p>

<p>My plan is to siphon off about a cup of the beer into a beer bottle and add some sugar and cover it with a balloon to see if the yeast is still in suspension. Once I bottle it for good I plan on letting it sit for a good 2 mo in the bottle, so even if it is really slow to carbonate I would think I should be good.

"Yeast Starter Stopper & Sanitization","<p>I'm going to be making my first yeast starter, for a higher gravity beer.</p>

<p>While reading starter guides, and watching videos, I've noticed that there are several different techniques and opinions for the flask stopper. It seems that the common approach is to use a piece of sanitized aluminum foil, loosely wrapped around the top. I've seen others use airlocks, but have seen just as much on the side, recommending that they be avoided.</p>

<p>I bought a starter kit which included a semi-dense foam stopper (from NB). It appears that it will allow permeation of oxygen, which I understand to be important for the starter. I will soak it in sanitizer before I cap the flask.</p>

<p>The fuorth was the Phat Tyre kit from Northern Brewer. Can't remember the SG though. It was low. They taste great, but the numbers weren't ""right"". What can I adjust so the numbers are more inline with the recipe? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Thank you for all the feedback. There are a number of factors for me to review and adjust. Given my current setup I will follow @mdma advice and recirculate the wort once and extend lautering to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>It will be a week or two before I can attempt this, so it will be awhile before I report back again.</p>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong>
I now have some awesome local contacts who are helping me out with technique and trouble shooting. Another (major) issue I could be experiencing is draining the wort way too fast. According to my friend. The drain should be low and slow after cycling a gallon or 2 of wort. sparging should take ~2 hours. for each gallon drained plato/brix should drop 3 points and go no lower than 3-5 points at the end.</p>

<p>the second recommendation is to heat up 3-5 gallons of water to 180 and poor it in prior to/while sparging.</p>

<p>my first attempt using this technique proved successful with the gravity being a lot closer to the anticipated OG. I had some temp issues with the batch, but I was so focused on sparging that I ignored the temp. My guess is I would have been right on if my temp didn't fall so low.</p>

<p><strong>Update #3</strong>
I had the chance to brew with my mentor this weekend and he pointed out 2 glaring problems with my mashing technique.</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting mash temp is too low. I was heating my water to 10-12 degrees above target temp. He recommends 17 degrees. between grain absorption &amp; the tun itself most of the heat dissipates within the first few minutes.
This does go against what I originally said. That I was hitting my temp marks. Looking back I was hasty with my readings.</li>
<li>I should not dump my sparge water (or lauter?) into the tun while draining the wort. The idea is to compact the liquid into the bottom of the tun thus compacting the sugars. I am stirring up the mash when I dump all sparge water in. We kept our sparge water 1-2 inches above the grain bed and our final results we excellent.</li>
</ol>

<p>A 3rd recommendation he made was to lower the pH of the water. tap water is ~7 and the ideal mash pH is 5.2. He added a solvent, which I cannot remember the name of, which did this for us. I'll be picking up some of that this weekend.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who helped me out with this problem.</p>

<p>My first and only other time working with a saison yeast (WLP 565/Dupont) was a bit of a disaster, probably due to underpitching (one vial only), stressing the yeast, and going a bit overboard with high fermentation temps (got it into the high 80's)...I eventually had to rack it onto a hefe cake to finish after it stalled at .040.  </p>

"How do I translate my water supply's ""Total Hardness"" to Mg and Ca or ""Effective Hardness""?","<p>My water supply comes through San Diego's Miramar treatment plant, and <a href=""http://www.sandiego.gov/water/pdf/wq13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's the data sheet</a>. Here's the relevant part:</p>

<pre><code>                    Units   Avg     Range
Total Hardness      ppm     214     142 - 243
Total Hardness      gr/Gal  12.2    8.3 - 14.2
</code></pre>

<p>And an excerpt from the footnotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hardness is the sum of polyvalent cations present in the water, which is essentially the sum of magnesium and calcium. These cations are usually naturally occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, now, I'm trying to use this scale under ""Determining the Beer Styles That Best Suit Your Water"" in <a href=""http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter15-3.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ch. 15.3 of John Palmer's <em>How to Brew</em></a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m2OKF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>What is my Effective Hardness? Is it the same as Total Hardness?</strong> (In which case, 214ppm seems very high on this scale—Is it possible my water is that hard?) <strong>Or, since the footnotes say Total Hardness is a <em>sum</em>, is my best bet to split 214ppm by some rough, sane-looking proportions</strong> like 75ppm Mg and 150ppm Ca, thus crossing over on the scale at about 145ppm Effective Hardness?</p>

<p>By the way, my CaCO3 level is 98.2ppm. Not sure this is relevant to hardness though—I imagine it's the non-alkaline Calcium that hardness is measuring.</p>

<p>I do know a store near me where I can get reverse osmosis water for 35 cents a gallon which is basically nothing. I'm more just curious about tap water chemistry, especially for amateur brewing.</p>

  <p>However, since yeast growth and fermentations are exothermic and therefore generate heat, figure that the temperature within the fermenter can be as much as 8 °F (4 ºC) higher than outside of the fermenter during the early days of fermentation. So beers that are fermenting in refrigerators set at 65 °F (18 ºC) are most likely fermenting at about 72 °F (22 ºC).</p>

<p>4 ºC is a huge difference!</p>

<p>Right now I have a carboy in a fridge that's temperature controlled to 19 ºC (on the lower side of the optimal range for WLP351). The sensor strip is taped to the glass of the carboy, and consistently reading 19.2 ºC.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if next time I should set the temperature control lower in the first 12 hours, but I realize I have no idea how that translates to change in different sections within the carboy—near the glass, the bottom, the top (where ale yeasts float, correct?), and so on. For example even if it's 19.2 ºC on the <em>outside</em> of the glass, the liquid touching the <em>inside</em> of the glass is probably much warmer due to convection.</p>

<p>Is there a gradient diagram or some rough formula that would help me determine the effective fermentation temperature (where the yeast actually is) from the outside glass temperature? Or, do I have to find a way to stick a (sanitized) sensor strip into the carboy.</p>

"Is the air glug in a conical not causing oxidation?","<p>This is likely a silly question to a lot of you but I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons, no matter how minor, of a conical before I make the jump. I'm maybe too paranoid about oxidation, but one of the main selling points of conical manufacturers is <em>less</em> oxidation. I could actually argue the opposite: With the design of most conicals you're going to introduce oxygen, from the bottom, after you attach a second bulb and open the valve back up. RIGHT? What's everyone's thoughts on how much oxidation that can cause? Is there processes/valve designs that avoid this?</p>

<p>Currently I ferment in carboys and pressurize them to push back out the racking tube...mostly so that I can leave them in the bottom of my freezer w/o disturbing the trub. But also, depending on beer style and how long I'm going to age, I pre-prime the lines and keg and can probably guarantee <em>very</em> little contact with air...ever.</p>

<p>Now, I'm also leaving it in one vessel for primary, secondary, and sometimes even up to a week of lagering. So, the optimization I see by moving to conical is just getting it off that trub sooner w/o rerack. I hate reracking.</p>

<p>So what do you guys think? What's more important: avoiding that little bit of oxygen, or getting it off the trub ASAP? Can I get both?</p>

<p>FYI, conical(s) I'm looking at is the <a href=""http://beersmith.com/fastferment-an-affordable-conical-beer-fermenter/"" rel=""nofollow"">FastFerment</a>.

"What makes a beer malty and sweet?","<p>I've read multiple times now that ""malty"", as a taste, does not mean ""sweet""; it is therefor possible to have a dry, malty brew, or a sweet, non malty brew. Is ""malty"" the same as ""body"", or is ""body"" one component of ""sweet""?</p>

<p>What is it that makes a homebrew ""sweet""? Is it simply a high final gravity? A high final gravity relative to original gravity? A low BU to OG (or FG) ratio? What about a high mash temperature that results in unfermentable sugars -- does this lend only to an increase in body, or also an increase in sweetness?</p>

<p>What is it that makes a homebrew ""malty""? Is it simply the choice of malts? If so, which malts contribute a ""malty"" flavor, and which contribute a ""non-malty"" flavor? (Incidentally, what is the word for non-malty?) Is it possible to have a low body but malty brew?</p>

"How low an original gravity is too low?","<p>I just brewed <a href=""https://beerbrew.com/downloads/Recipes/WhaleArrowIPA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this extract IPA</a>.

Is this a reasonable deviation from the recipe, considering it would be even lower if I topped it off?</p>

<p>It sounds like most low gravity readings are due to the top-off water not being mixed.  I did not add any top off water, but I also did not mix the wort after pouring it in.  I poured the ~2.5 gal. of wort through a strainer/funnel over the 2 gal. of water already in the fermentor.   Is it still possible the heavy wort, despite being poured over the water, sunk to the bottom and thus gave me a low reading on the top?</p>

<p>So now I'm not sure if my beer is too strong or too weak.  Is there a way to tell whether I should add the remaining water during bottling?  For example, if my OG is low and my FG is high, maybe it would indicate my OG reading was wrong?  But if my FG is also low, maybe I shouldn't add water.</p>

60 min Boil
5.5 Gal into primary</p>

<p>I didn't use a starter, I just pitched the yeast straight out of the vial. The fermentation didn't start for about 48 hours. Then I found the plug and blowoff tube had completely blown off and there was a large amount of beer sludge caked all over the fermenter and puddled all over the floor. I cleaned up and replaced the blowoff with an airlock. Once it stopped bubbling I measured the gravity over the course of the next few days and it settled on 1.020, a full 5 points high. </p>

<p>In the other scenario, we start with 10L of wort in our main kettle. But this was obtained using BIAB, and we re-use the bag in a second (smaller) kettle. So when the boil starts we are boiling 10L in one kettle and around 4-5L in a second kettle. As wort boils off in the main kettle, we add wort from the second kettle. Let's say we do this every 15 minutes. </p>

<p>The two scenarios obviously differ, but at the end of the boil they should have the same amount of wort left: 10L. A simple figure may illustrate this.

The swamp cooler isn't good enough, however, and requires substituting frozen water bottles 3x per day. This is absolutely excellent for keeping a ceiling on the wort temperature. However, the temperature swings beneath the ceiling can be pretty severe. For my current 4 batches going, I have put the ceiling at 66, but temperatures vary widely from 57-66, 24 hours per day.</p>

<p>I hear from this forum and others that temperature swings are also bad (that it will stress the yeast).</p>

<p>What is the reasoning behind this? I.e., too high of a temperature causes ester formation. Ester = off flavor. </p>

<p>Do the temperature swings, even with a ceiling on temperature, cause off flavors? Why. If they don't cause off flavors, why are they bad (other than swings that would cause a decrease in attenuation for going too low)? The swings are no doubt superior to ester production from too-high of a temperature, correct?</p>

<p>I would imagine that with a ceiling, a swing of 20*F would be bad as it would cause a lower attenuation. So for the second part of my question, lets add a theoretical floor to whatever temperature gives the maximum effective attenuation for a given strain. In this circumstance, with a ceiling (to prevent esters) and a floor (to retain attenuation), why would swings be bad?</p>

"Used large bottle caps now have uncarbonated beer","<p>Just noticed that i used the large bottle caps on my coffee stout and of course all the beer is not carbonated (tastes fine just not carbonated).</p>

<p>I wanted to make the move to kegging after i went all grain but i rather not loose this batch so i thought i buy a keg and force carbonate this batch. Can this be done even though i added priming sugar? Some of the beers were very lightly carbonated. The beer has been in bottles for about 3 weeks.</p>

<p>I was just going to pour each bottle into the keg, maybe thru a filter? Will i have any issues going this route? Anything else i can do to carbonate the beer?</p>

"Sugar source and alcohol content in Ginger Beer","<p>Made my second batch of ginger beer the other day, and not sure if different sugars perhaps produced a little more alcohol..</p>

<p>For my first batch, I used 2 cups of pure cane sugar and 1 packet of dry champagne yeast from red star to yield ~1 gallon. I let the bottles sit at room temperature for a little more than a day, then I dropped them in the fridge.</p>

<p>For my second, I doubled the batch, but instead of 4 cups of sugar , I used 3 cups, and ~13 oz. pineapple juice (Reed's uses pineapple juice, so thought I'd give it a try). I also added the cane sugar by making a simple syrup this time to make sure it all dissolves, as well as added some lime--neither of which should have an effect on fermentation(?). I pitched the same red star yeast after letting my pot sit in the fridge for a few hours to cool.</p>

<p>--Edit: I used 1# of ginger/gallon yield and 1 lemon for both. Those didn't change between batches.</p>

<p>I bottled it all yesterday and ran out of bottles (beer's taking them all up!) so I poured the left overs into a Nalgene bottle which I took to work today to see if it's carbonated. To my surprise/satisfaction, when I opened the bottle it announced with a nice 'tssh!' that it was nice and fizzy. However, after drinking a pint's worth, I'm pretty sure this batch is...different. </p>

<p>As a beer-brewing, red-blooded, beard-adorned American, I can tell when I've had alcohol, and I'm 95% sure this ginger beer is a little more 'special' than my first batch. Given I just ate lunch prior to drinking it, it must have at least 2% alcohol to make me even <em>notice</em> anything, or even think about it. My beer brewing experience says this doesn't make much sense, but then I remembered the key difference between this batch and the prior, and one thing I learned from nutritional science in college: fructose is the simplest of sugars, and pineapple juice packs a lot of fructose. The champagne yeast is probably having a party with the stuff--and I'm actually enjoying my Monday at work.</p>

<p>Does that at least pass the smell test? Could champagne yeast have turned that much sugar into a noticeable alcohol content in less than 24 hours? Is there that big of a difference between cane sugar, and fructose? Or was there potentially some weird fungus growing on the ginger root that I used, explaining my general euphoria at work today?</p>

"First time without a kit","<p>Ok, so I'm a relatively new brewer.  I've done probably 10 brews, however I've always done it out of a kit and have kegged it afterwards.  Brewing from a kit is super easy, it's basically boil it, bucket it, put it in a keg.  I have a few questions though, since I'm trying to brew without a kit this time.  I went to the homebrew store, told them what I wanted to make, and they gave me the ingredients, but I don't have instructions. First off, here's what I have:</p>

<pre><code>1 lb Plain Extra Dark DME,
A bag of grains,
5 oz lactose,
Oats,
1 oz Czech Saaz hop pellets,
Irish moss
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking to brew a 1 gallon vanilla coffee oatmeal milk stout.  Can anyone help me out with what times and temperatures would be a good estimate to accomplish this?  What I'm thinking based on how I remember brewing from kits, I should boil the grain bag for about 20 minutes, reduce to about 165 degrees and add the hop pellets, 1 oz of lactose, and the DME for about 45 minutes.  The Irish moss I add 1/4 tsp in the last 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Does all this sound right?  If not, which step should I change?</p>

<p>Also, when would I add the oats?  Would that go in with my grains, then removed after the 20 minutes, or should I add that later and siphon out?</p>

"What is the right amount of priming sugar for a bottle with expandable head space?","<p>When bottling in plastic (PET) bottles, it is possible to eliminate oxygen from the bottle by squeezing the bottle.  Below is a <strong>3 liter bottle</strong> with only <strong>one liter of beer in it:</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KydVg.jpg"" alt=""Partially Filled 3 Liter Bottle""></p>

<p>I have done this before, but the ratio of beer was always above 8 parts beer to 1 part headspace, so it was not worth trying to figure out the precise formula to get carbonation perfect.  But since in this case it's 1 part beer to 2 parts headspace, I wonder what would be the correct amount of priming sugar.</p>

<p>If I desire 2.5 volumes of CO2 in the beer, the beer is at 72 degrees F, the 1 liter of beer is in a 3 liter bottle with all the headspace squeezed out, how much corn sugar should be added in this example?  What would be the formula to calculate priming sugar, given a defined expandable (to a point) headspace?</p>

"Pomegranate wine colour?","<p>The pictures of pomegranate wine I have seen on the internet seem like very dark red wine. The one I made however looked like a milkish pink.

Below is a pic of before and after fermentation. I think I can manage removing the milky aspect of the wine by using pectin enzyme. Running tests now.
However there’s still a significant loss of color. I’d like a nice ruby red and not a twilight pink.</p>

"Post-fermentation Belgian Pale Ale","<p>I'm brewing a Belgian Pale Ale on Monday (12). It's my first time and using BeerSmith has been of great help. These last few days have filled me with a whole lot of doubts though. After fermantation is done (2-3 days with the same FG value) I'm gonna drop temperature down to 10 °C for maturation. On Beersmith it says under Carbonation and Storage tab that keg/bottling temperature is 21,1 °C, carbonation used is about 175 g DME, aging time is 30 days and storage temperature is 18,3 °C. Is 30 days the time I should leave the beer in the fermentation bucket maturing at 10 °C or the time i should leave the bottled beer resting? If the latter, how long should I leave beer for during maturation?</p>

"Can I fix a higher than anticipated OG after primary?","<p>I just brewed a witbier that was way below the estimated preboil gravity of 1.49. I only got 1.34 in case you're wondering.  I've never had that bad of an efficiency before.  The grains came prepackaged and my guess it that either the total weight of the grain was light and/or some of it wasn't crushed properly.  Or, for whatever reason my brewhouse or my brain decided to take a break that day.  RHAHB.</p>

<p>To get it back up to the expected preboil gravity I added DME to get it to 1.49, or so says my hydrometer after my temp adjustment.  I must have done something wrong in my calcs, because my OG ended being 1.66 instead of 1.56.  That, combined with my yeast starter is going to prove a very boozy witbier.  More than I want, actually.</p>

<p>I've already pitched and want to see through the fermentation process without topping off, partly because I want to see if I can notice the difference (isn't that what homebrewing is all about?) and partly because I don't want to mess with the primary since my blowoff tube looks like I've just brewed a DIPA.  If I find it too boozy am I able to top-off after the primary?</p>

<p>I can always add water in the secondary or the keg before I force carbonate.  Physically adding water to reduce the PPG in not an issue, but I'm not sure if there are any ramifications to the beer itself.</p>

<p>I have several batches of beer that are already bottled that could use some CaCl2. The CaCl2 from my local homebrew store appears to be anhydrous, so I can't simply measure out the appropriate amount of salt per bottle and add this as needed to each glass because the salt starts pulling water from the air and making a mess of things.</p>

<p>Quick note about storage temp: I know 70F is at the top end of D47. It's winter here in the South, so it's getting cold(er). We keep the house at 70F most of the day, except at night where we let the temp drop to 62F before the heat kicks back on. My storage is in the center of the house, so it is always within one degree F of what the thermostat says; I check it often with a temp gun. Exceptions being if we have a hot day; thermostat is on HEAT right now so temps above the setting are ignored. I don't remember any exceptionally warm days in the last month, but maybe one or two. Based on my research I don't think the problem is temp; it's the South so a cold snap is unlikely and supposedly the worst that could happen with temp being too high is getting extra fusels from the yeast.</p>

<p>What you have above are basically my notes, so there's little bits of info about how it was measured or whatever just in case it proves important. In case you were wondering, no I didn't add Go-Ferm and I was an idiot and didn't bother to re-hydrate my D47 before pitching it either; I just opened two dry packs and chucked them in. I know...shame upon me, my cow, my family.</p>

<p>I'm sure you've noticed that I've only added Fermaid-K up to this point; it's all I have. You may also be wondering about the amount of Fermaid-K I've added up to this point; I AM TOO. I've looked and looked and I keep finding conflicting info on how much to add, and it's not like within a 25% difference. Some say to add what I have added, and some say to add double or triple that amount. I've also seen others say that if you add too much you may get an odd flavor(it's the Fermaid) or you may end up feeding competing organisms and make life hell for you and your yeast.</p>

<p>So on Dec 17, I took a reading and got 1.063. This is when I became concerned something may be wrong. I started reading up, trying to find out if I've stalled or what. I've seen the other posts on here, one of which was really close to mine, but didn't get a clear answer on what my additions should have been nor on what they should be NOW to try and restart it.</p>

<p>I took a reading last night(Day 31) and got what I think was 1.062. You all know it can be difficult to read those tiny refractometer lines sometimes, so it could have also been willful delusion and it's just sitting at 1.063. After reading more online, I decided to try one of the suggestions and do another Fermaid-K addition to kick things off again. I added 1/4tsp(~1g) of Fermaid-K with ~30ml distilled water and gave it a good stir to degas, mix in the addition and get the yeast floating around again. No O2 was (intentionally) added.</p>

<h3>Update 12/21:</h3>

<p><strong><em>Thanks to chthon, I took a new sample of the mead today and found that my refractometer was much more pessimistic than my hydrometer. Refractometer reading shows us at 1.059, which is good that's it's still dropping, but completely off-base because the hydrometer is showing us at 1.030. This is MUCH better than we thought, but still far above my target of 1.000-1.010 for this mead, and let me tell you, it is SWEET. I'm in cheap sugar wine territory at this point. So my questions below still stand. Also, the mead is still bubbling through the blow-off tube, though maybe once every 1.5-2.0 seconds.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Update 12/26:</h3>

<p><strong><em>Merry Christmas! SG seems to still be dropping, hooray! So either I panicked a little early, or the nutrient add on the Day 31 helped out. Either way, things are still rolling so I'll check it again next week to see if we get closer to our target. And lastly,</em></strong> <em>can someone answer my questions around nutrient additions?</em> <strong><em>Thanks again!</em></strong></p>

<p>===========</p>

<p><strong>Mead Doctors:</strong> mistakes were made and I want to learn from those, but what do I do about this right now? <del>How do I kick this off again so I can hit my target of 1.000-1.010?</del> <strong>Should I add more nutrients?</strong> <del>Is she dead?</del></p>

<p><strong>Second question: what is the correct addition of Fermaid-K to a basic mead like this?</strong> I've gone with ~1g/1gal, but I've seen as high as 4g/1gal mentioned on this site. Maybe I've misunderstood total additions vs amount per add with four scheduled adds? I don't know. Help?</p>

<p>Last request: lay it on me. Let your wisdom flow forth and sear the shame of incomplete steps and shortcuts into my memory forever so that I may never fall prey to the temptation of laziness, nor the unfounded confidence of ignorance ever again.</p>

"Help me debug my Christmas Ale band-aid flavor","<p>Recently I brewed two batches of a <a href=""https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/742223/christmas-ale-december-2018-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">copycat Christmas Ale</a>. You can ignore the recipe's water adjustments, since I didn't do them.</p>

<p>Before fermenting, the wort smelled and tasted perfect - just the right amount of sugar and spice. I figured that it would turn out fantastic (both batches).</p>

<p>The first batch sat in the bottle for 2 weeks, and when I tasted I was quite disappointed. It had essentially no spice characteristic in smell or taste, and it had a slight band-aid smell, but much more noticeable in the taste. Still drinkable, but not as pleasant as one would hope. The second batch just finished primary fermentation and has a similar taste, but much less of the smell. Slightly band-aid-y flavor in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Here are my ideas for what went wrong:</p>

<p><strong>Batch 1</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>completely forgot to sanitize the carboy (even though I did sanitize everything else) - I was drinking, and cooking for 8 people while I was making this beer. Not my best idea, so I'm guessing bacterial infection</li>
<li>pitched too much yeast; used about 5.5g for a 4L batch; the recommendation for Safale S-04 is 11.5g for 20-30L (so I may have overpitched by about 2-3x</li>
<li>fermented at too high of a temperature (my apartment was roughly 22C/72F, but with the fermentation heat it probably was right at the 25C/77F yeast threshold)</li>
<li>chlorine in the water did not have time to dissipate (I did not adjust water chemistry, and did not leave the water overnight to let the chlorine evaporate)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, batch 1 was a complete disaster on all fronts, so I'm not surprised it turned out the way it did. However, I tried to improve things for batch 2.</p>

<p><strong>Batch 2</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>fermented for about 12 hours at 22C/72F before I read up on too high of temperature potentially producing phenol alcohol; I immediately chilled my apartment down to a safer 18C/65F, right in the middle of the yeast's temperature range factoring in heat from fermentation</li>
<li>pitched approximately 5.5g for an 8L batch (so a little closer to the guideline of 11.5g per 20L-30L), but still may have overpitched</li>
</ul>

<p>I sanitized everything properly in batch 2, so I don't think it was bacterial infection.</p>

<hr>

<p>For both batches, it could have been chlorine in the water, the fermentation temperature being too high (in batch 2 for 12 hours), that I overpitched the yeast, or that maybe even the spices didn't ferment well or that they were boiled at inappropriate times. I  just can't be sure. Last summer I made a beer with cinnamon and ginger with no issues, but I've added clove and nutmeg to this one - so maybe it could be that they give off some nasty compounds when boiled or fermented? Maybe it's just Safale S-04 that gives off this medicinal characteristic (as is desirable in some English ales, apparently), and over-pitching led to it being much more noticeable.</p>

<p>Do you guys have any ideas as to what went wrong? I am tempted to rule out bacteria simply because I made sure to properly sanitize everything in batch 2. </p>

"Pressurized Ferment Yeast Harvest -- what are these layers?","<p>I'm poured the keg remnants from a pressurized ferment into a beaker to let it settle out but I'm puzzled by the layers I'm seeing.  From a typical non-pressure ferment, you see (from the bottom up), trub/hops, yeast and then beer/amber liquid--like you see here: </p>

<p>I assume the foam was the result of releasing the last bit of pressure that had built up (probably a few psi) which foamed up the contents.  The foam looks pretty yeasty but the yeast is usually not on top.  It's not quite visible in the picture but it does look like there is a shallow layer settling out/building up at the base of the bottom layer.  Should I assume the bottom layer will ultimately end up as a layer of trub/hops, and the yeast, and ignore that yeasty looking top layer?  </p>

<p>Is what I'm seeing typical for a pressurized ferment? </p>

"Ginger bug causing a gelatinous soda","<p>I have been making ginger soda. But after fermenting, the soda was very viscous and slimy in some of the batches. It usually turns out fine but this happened multiple times inconsistently with different starts. Does anybody know what may be causing this?</p>

<p>Recipe used:
Ginger Bug (ginger, sugar, and water)
Strong ginger tea
dilute with water and add sugar to 6-7 brix sweetness</p>

<p>i usually ferment until ~5 brix before putting in the fridge.</p>

<p>so really the only things in this are ginger, sugar and water, plus whatever bugs might be on the ginger skin.</p>

<p>the first time i thought it might be a contamination so i made a new ginger bug start. i've also moved since then with another new start. but unless i'm contaminating it in the same way every time in different environments, i don't know how i'm getting the same gelatinous consistency, so i think it might be specific to the bug?</p>

<p>i do make sourdough as well, but not usually at the same time, and i don't have any other ferments in the house.</p>

"Will reused yeast change beer taste?","<p>I noticed that some breweries and home brewers reuse yeast for next batch.</p>

The 6g of sugar bottles had less flavor and were a little bit sweet, and they had more carbonation than the 3g but it is still not enough. </p>

"Life expectancy of swing-top bottles","<p>I started brewing less than a year ago. In that time I've acquired about 60 swing top bottles, and filled about 200, I estimate I've filled each bottle less than 5 times. The last batches I made were a biere de Garde, an ESB and a Xmas ale. Unfortunately the carbonation of the biere de Garde was totally lacking, essentially on a par with the bitter, which I put down to some kind of mistake (not enough sugar, not enough time at room temp) until I started cracking open the crown cap bottles. One of them was a gusher and the others had big foamy euro style heads. I now believe the swing tops are to blame and were not holding pressure. </p>

<p>My question therefore is:</p>

<p>How long should swing tops be viable for?</p>

<p>And also:
Is there anything I can do to improve their performance short of replacing all the seals?
Is there anything I've done that could be to blame for them having deteriorated? I usually just rinse bottles immediately after use then fill with milton/VWP for 15 mins and rinse immediately before filling, and leave the tops in a bowl of the same.</p>

"How to calculate ABV when adding fermentable sugar or fruit to secondary fermentation?","<p><strong>Fermentable Sugar, e.g. Maple Syrup</strong><br>
I brewed a Maple Stout before Christmas in which I racked the beer to a secondary fermentation vessel where I added 550g of Maple Syrup. I let it sit at 12ºC for 4 days before racking to keg. The schedule was as so:</p>

<pre><code>Day 0,  O.G. = 1.067
Day 10, S.G. = 1.015, transfer to secondary, S.G. = ?
Day 14, F.G. = 1.017, transfer to keg
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't think to take a gravity reading after mixing the beer with the Maple Stout (doh), but even if I did, is that how the ABV would be calculated? Adding the 6.83% of 1.067-1.015 and X% of 1.0xx-1.017. E.g. 1.020-1.017 is 0.39% so 6.83% + 0.39% = 7.22%?</p>

<p>As Christmas was around the corner I just labelled it up as 7.2% and let it be, but for future brews I want to be able to know the exact ABV.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit</strong><br>
Any sort of sugar or syrup would be the same as whatever method is described for above, but fruit I imagine would be more difficult.</p>

<p>How would one make the calculations if adding fruit? For example, using the same gravity readings above for Day 0 and Day 10 of 1.067 to 1.015, how would you work out the ABV if adding 500g of Mango and 500g Apricot into the secondary fermentation? Or any other fruit for that matter. How do the breweries do it?</p>

"Why do my spice flavors disappear when my beer is chilled?","<p>I recently brewed a second batch of Christmas ale, which was spiced with cinnamon, ginger, clove and nutmeg.

Then I decided to open a bottle that <em>hadn't</em> been chilled, and the spice character was <em>much</em> more present, especially the cinnamon and clove.</p>

"How long should I wait for priming solution to mix when added to a keg?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>After my beer reached FG I transferred it into a corny keg, cold crashed in my keezer at 42°F, and fined with gelatin.  48 hours after adding the gelatin I pulled about a pint of sludge until the beer was looking clear.</p>

<p>I'd like to add priming solution to the beer and bottle straight from my corny keg in a few days.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I pour my priming solution into the top of the keg, will it mix effectively so that I'm not left with varying amounts of carbonation in each bottle (or perhaps even bottle bombs)?</p></li>
<li><p>How long should I allow the keg to sit to ensure the priming solution has mixed completely?</p></li>
<li><p>I'll be keeping the keg at 42°F prior to bottling, which I assume means the yeast (Wyeast Irish Ale - 1084) will be dormant and won't start working on the priming sugar until I've bottled the beer and warmed it up.  Is that a safe assumption?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each time the keg has been opened it has been sealed and purged with 15PSI and then taken off gas.  I assume this has added a negligible amount of CO2 that can be ignored for priming calculations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE (3 weeks later)</strong></p>

<p>Carbonation levels appear to be consistent on bottles filled at both the beginning and end of the keg.  Only 1 of ~10 random bottles sampled seemed different (slightly over-carbed).</p>

<p>I did exactly as @jsolarski recommended and gently poured the priming solution into the keg, sealed and purged, gave it a gentle shake/roll, and bottled after a few minutes.</p>

<p>In the future I will do multiple gentle rolls and wait at least 15 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.</p>

"Staggered 2 primary fermentations. Then fermentation started in the Demi again. Is the wine ok?","<p>So i decided to try grape wine last year since my friend had a backyard full of grapes that were going to go to waste. My process ended up a little complicated and now I wonder if it’s still ok.</p>

<p>I harvested as many grapes as I could around the end of September. I took as many as I thought I’d need to fill a 25L Demi, crushed and started fermenting a must and froze the rest of the grapes. I didn’t add any sugar, and also managed to completely forget to take a hydrometer reading. </p>

<p>The must started up within a day and was pushing the skins to the top for about 4-5 days (stirring the skins back in 2-3 times a day) then over the next 2-3 days it slowed and seemed more of less done so I filtered it into a Demi. It ended up to be only about 20 L so I knew I had to get it topped up. Likely with what I had frozen.</p>

<p>Before I got to making another small must I had to move. And whether it was the time it took to get settled in my new home or procrastination the 20L of wine sat in the Demi for about 2 months... By the time I got around to dealing with it I found it had a little patches of a white layer on top. I read it was typical with the space I had left, but it was salvageable. So I racked it to another Demi from the middle, below the top white layer and dosed it with campdon. </p>

<p>At the same time I had started a must with the grapes I had frozen. That fermented just as the last for about a week. Again I forget to measure hah. I pressed it and added it to the batch I recently racked. From racking I had lost a few L so I ended up still short..about 1.5L to be nice and full... I was out of grapes, a so I ended up adding some fresh, additive free grape juice, sealed it and moved on.</p>

<p>I put it in my cold cellar and within maybe 3 days or so it was bubbling fairly significantly. It’s been about 2 weeks now and it’s still got a slow but steady bubbles rising. Could it still be fermenting off the grape juice sugar I added? Or maybe it was stuck, or has some bacteria taken over or what..? Is it ruined? Or can I just dose it with campdon? I sort of didn’t want to </p>

<p>Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks 🙏 </p>

"Do I have to use Campden tablets every time I expose my wine to external factors?","<p>So, I'm pretty concerned about infections, seeing as my very first try ended in sauerkraut-smelling disappointment.

However, the wine refuses to clear, so I was hoping to help it with some fining agents.</p>

<p>Normally I assumed that I should add Campden tablets anytime I open the carboy to prevent infections. However, that means I've added quite a lot already (I think 3-4 tablets for this one gallon over its lifetime) so would like to avoid adding more.

"Refractometer - what exactly can it measure?","<p>I am using a refractometer to determine gravities. I am aware of course that values measured need to be corrected depending on OG of the fermenting batch. What I don't know is, what kind of sugars am I measuring. Am I only measuring fermentable sugars or also non-fermentables, i.e. should the measured final gravity of a malty beer be higher than the one of a really dry beer? Or is the measured final gravity only dependent on the yeast/attenuation?</p>

"Dry Irish Stout Tastes very much like grain","<p>I brewed my first Irish Stout on Oct 22. I used the Nitro-Powered Stout recipe that Brian Smith has on his BeerSmith website. The only changes I made to the recipe is I replaced the Ultra hops with Saaz as my LHBS didn't have any Ultra, and I opted not to include the Gypsum since I don't know the composition of my tap water. The recipe calls for 6 lb of Dark DME and 1 lb of roasted barley.  I steeped the barley for 30 minutes at 156 degrees F, then added the dME and boiled for 45 minutes. Everything went fine, the wort seemed like it would give me a fantastic Stout. Once through the primary for 7 days, secondary for another 7, then bottled for several weeks, it has this very strong taste of what has to be the roasted barley. I feel like if I strained it through a tea towel, there would be a film of barley there. The only thing I did different with steeping the grains than I've done before was to use cheesecloth tied up instead of an official grain sock or nylon bag. There was no leakage and it stayed tied the whole time. Any ideas on what could cause this, or is this normal for a homebrew dry stout? (I may have answered my own question once I remembered I used cheesecloth as a grainbag, is it possible it's not as fine of a mesh and there actually is a haze of barley floating in this brew?) Thanks for your answers.</p>

"Estimating the ABV in finshed product","<p>Is this a viable method?:
In theory you can calculate an <strong>estimated</strong> ABV by using the formula 17*X%*YL.
This means that 17 gr sugar produces 1% alc. in 1 liter mash.
So if you know at what alc.% your yeast gives in and how many liters mash you make you can derive how much sugar you should add to reach there.</p>

<p>To know for sure when all sugar is consumed by the yeast, using a hydrometer and the formula that 2,7 gram sugar is 1° Oechsle in 1 liter mash, you would be able to know when all sugar is gone. </p>

<p>If you keep track of consumed sugar on the hydrometer scale, and when it finishes bubbling as predicted - would you be able to <strong>verify</strong> the ABV with a refractomer measuring plain % alcohol??</p>

"Overflowing yeast starter","<p>I made a yeast starter last night with 1500 ml of water, 150 g DME and a Wyeast 1056 smack pack. After boiling, total volume was just under 1500 ml. I put it in a 2 liter erlenmeyer flask on a stir plate and covered the top with foil. By morning it went Mt. Vesuvius and had bubbled out the top all over my stir plate. I've definitely lost some yeast.</p>

<p>I've made several of these before and never had this happen. Is this unusual? What is a reasonable volume starter for a 2 liter flask?

This wasnt intended for drinking (no sanitisation first etc) just for producing co2 as cheaply as possible.</p>

<p>I came to change my mixture today and rather than just throw away whatever it is i'd fermented I thought i'd try syphoning the mix into another 2ltr bottle (this is called racking, right?). Then, unable to resist, i poured a little into a glass and tasted expecting vinegar. Although its quite sharp to taste, its not vinegar by any means! it is still very fizzy and has a lasting sharp taste that tbh is not unpleasant.

"Fermentation issue - Airlock overflow","<p>I'm brewing my first batch ever, we did our best but something is going on in the fermentation and I'm not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Here is a 30 sec video of the issue: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHd8HJSzZfM&amp;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHd8HJSzZfM&amp;</a></p>

<p>Basically there is a lot of foam and the airlock is overflowed by it.
Data:
- The initial density of this batch was 1050, even though we tried to make it less, our initial malt/water ratio during the maceration phase was a bit off so the density was huge.
- The yeast we used was a 11gr Golden Ale (0.3 oz)
- The amount of wort is around 20lts (5.2 gallons)</p>

<p>We were worried a bit about the high density and the yeast being very little, but a brewer friend of mine told me it would just delay the fermentation because the yeast will have to multiply more before it starts fermenting. And it did, fermentation took close to 48hs to start.</p>

<p>Thanks for any input you might give :) hopefully we will save the batch.</p>

"What are all the factors that contribute to short fermentation time?","<p>I've got an event coming up and I've got one beer that I'm going to bring, but I'm thinking about brewing another. If I do that, I need to turn it around in about two weeks. Which is probably too short, even with force carbonating. But it got me thinking about what goes into a short fermentation time, and I don't know much about how the different components contribute to time.</p>

<p>I think I would want to have a fairly low OG, like around 1.04. Probably a pilsner, but maybe a low alcohol wheat would be good. Do different types of grains have different effects beyond just the sugar they contribute? Do I want to avoid specialty grains? Does extract, partial, or all grain make a difference?</p>

<p>Then hops, maybe a session IPA is the way to go. I've heard that the reason you dry hop after the primary fermentation is done is because the hops can interfere with fermentation. If that's true, do I want to keep the hops low overall? Are hops equal in this respect, or is it specifically related to something that varies with the variety?</p>

<p>For the yeast I think I would want to have something that is heat tolerant and low esters, so I can raise the temperature a bit and encourage growth. Is there such a thing as too much of a starter?</p>

I sterilised everything as normal. Got my 2 litres of boiling water and added the contents of my coopers Australian pale ale to it mixed it up with the spoon. Filled the fermentation bucket up to the 22.5L level. Seen it was at 25°c and pitched the yeast. Then had a sudden realisation what I'd missed. Forgot to add the brewing sugar. So I quickly opened my coopers beer enhancer 2 and added it on top of the yeast. Gave it a stir to break the sugar up. And sealed it up. What I'm wondering is because I pitched the yeast before adding the brewing sugar will it affect it in anyway? Because I added the sugar after I'd filled the bucket the total volume went up to 23.5L too. Also because I did it in a stupid order I had to take my o.g reading with the yeast pitched so will this effect anything?
Please help I made a right mess of this one.

Perhaps I don't understand really what a 'mash out' is. (That is a subject for another question.) My question here (and perhaps it relates to the mash out) is that it lists grains for both the mash and the vorlauf.

"Mead Stuck Fermentation","<p>So, I made a 5 gallon batch of mead on 10Apr2015. I used 17 lbs of pasteurized clover honey and 4 gallon of spring water (no-boil method). OG = 1.130. I used D47 Lalvin yeast (3 packs) with 1/4 tsps  of Ferm K and 1/2 tsp of DAP 4 times in the first 3 days. Temperature is pretty stable at 68-70F.</p>

<p>I as planning to add some strawberries at G=1.050 (ABV~10%) to make it a melomel, but... </p>

<p>After 7 days of strong fermentation it stuck around 1.090. It took 3 weeks to move it from 1.090 to 1.060.

Right now it is on 1.050 and I am planning to add some frozen strawberries (5-7 lbs)... </p>

<p>Is it normal? Would adding berries boost the fermentation? I want to drop it at least to 1.025. Should I increase the temperature to speed up the process? I'm afraid that it will stop at 1.035-40 or something. Could it be because of the honey? I haven't had any issues with my other meads.

"US-05 Fermentation Temperatures / Top Cropping","<p>Brewed a 1.060 OG IPA last night (extract), pitched a packet of US-05 reconstituted with 5 ounces of water.  Pitched at 68 degrees, but I wanted a clean fermentation with minimal esters, so I have the fermenter at an ambient temp of 63 degrees.  Less than 12 hours of a lag, and I'm seeing some airlock activity, thermstrip on the fermenter reads 63 degrees.  A couple of questions:</p>

<p>1.)  I know this is the low, low end of US-05's preferred fermentation temperatures, but unfortunately, I do not have temp control at the moment, so its either 63 degrees (basement) or 68/70 degrees (main floor of house).  Do I have yeast strain issues at 63 with US-05?  I would warm it up to 68/70 after a week or so for a diacetyl rest (may not be necessary).  The other problem is there might be some minimal draft/temp fluctuation in the basement this time of year.   </p>

<p>2.)  I have never top-cropped before, but want to use this yeast for a cream ale I'm doing next week.  The common knowledge is that US-05 rarely needs a starter, but since I am propogating from a working batch, I thought it might be a good idea.  The alternative is just cropping, funnel into a vial, and pitch into the cream ale (OG will likely be low .060's).  Small starter with the stir plate or no?</p>

"Can a water heater element be installed in a conduit punched hole?","<p>I'm thinking I want to build myself a kettle with a heater, a valve and a cooling coil. So four holes. probably, two different sizes</p>

"Honey/Ginger Brew With Champagne Yeast","<p>I got it in my head last weekend that I needed to homebrew again (it's been more than 10 years!), and so I boiled 4lbs of honey, 2lbs of ginger, 1lb of dark brown sugar and 1.5lbs of raisins (since none of that other stuff has much in the way of yeast nutrients beyond sugars) with some cinnamon and other spices and put it in my 6-gallon beer carboy with 1pckg of Red Star champagne yeast.  By the next morning, I had one bubble in the airlock every 4 seconds.  Less than a week later, I'm down to 1 bubble every 5 seconds.  So I'm using champagne yeast for primary fermentation.  I have no idea how this is going to turn out, how long it's going to take to finish primary fermentation or whether I just wasted $30 worth of ingredients.  </p>

"How to chill wort","<p>I have made a few batches of beer from those home brew kits sold at Brew n Grow.  When I cook the beer, I only am boiling 2.5 gallons instead of the whole 5, per instructions, and then I add the other 2.5 gallons from my tap water.  My question is, is they recommend a wort chiller.  When I add the 2.5 gallons to get my total of 5 gallons, it naturally cools down the beer because the tap water is cold.  What advantages does the wort chiller have?  I suppose the tap water doesn't get it all the way cool, but does a great portion of the cooling, because basically it is direct cooling as opposed to heat transfer cooling through a copper tube.  Does adding the 2.5 gallons of cold tap water introduce potential bacteria into my wort??  </p>

"How to compensate for wort internal temperature when using a temp controller?","<p>What's the best method to use a temperature controller during fermentation? If you're using a freezer (or warming apparatus) connected to the controller, how do you compensate for the fact that the wort's interior temperature can be several degrees higher than the air temperature around the fermentor?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/6212/cant-get-accurate-temperature-with-johnson-controls-and-freezer"">answering a recent question</a> about temperature control inside a freezer, mdma stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, if you want to be really sure what your fermentation
  temperature is, it's best to add a thermowell and a separate
  thermometer. Don't be tempted to use the controller thermometer to
  both measure and control the wort temperature - the wort changes
  temperature very slowly, and the controller will overshoot massively,
  causing everything else in the freezer to be frozen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was enlightening to me. I just bought a temp controller and until reading this post I had been planning to put the controller probe into the thermowell. If I understand what mdma is saying, because the relatively dense mass of the wort will not change temperature as quickly as the surrounding air, by the time the probe in the thermowell has reached the target temperature, the air surrounding the fermentor will have dropped considerably farther. Then the ambient temp will continue to chill the wort itself, resulting in a lower-than-expected wort temp and wider swings in temp as the controller cycles cooling on and off, thus defeating the goal of maintaining a consistent temperature.</p>

<p>(Side note: I suspect that when fermenting ales at room temperatures, the rest of the freezer is unlikely to get all the way down to freezing temperatures, but it would still be a significant variance.)</p>

<p>So how do you balance between air temp and wort temp? Do you just keep an eye on it and adjust the controller if the difference is significant? How much do you compensate between air temp and wort temp?</p>

"Liquid Malt Extract Variation","<p>While picking up supplies for my 2nd brew yesterday, I noticed that I'm using the same LME for this brew (pale ale) as I did for my last (brown ale). In fact, I only saw the one barrel, so I think this could be the only LME my shop carries.</p>

<p>To me this seems odd. The only differences in ingredients for these 2 brews are the 2ish pounds of grains, and the hops.

"Once a beer is carbonated in the bottle, are there any benefits to aging it?","<p>First time brewer.</p>

<p>I have my beer in the bottle (for about 8 days now).  Things are good -- yeast is precipitating out.  The instructions that came with the kit suggested to put 1 bottle's worth of beer in a PET plastic bottle instead of glass -- and when the PET bottle is firm to the touch (i.e. you can't really squeeze it anymore), the beer is carbonated.</p>

<p>The plastic bottle has gotten to this point, but the kit said between ""2 weeks to 1 month, maybe even as long as 2 months"" of bottle conditioning time, depending on the ambient temperature and the mood of the yeast.  I've kept the box with the bottles consistently between 18~23C (64~73F).</p>

<p>I am really anxious to pop open one of the bottles (after refrigerating it of course!) and have a taste -- is there any reason why I shouldn't?

<p>I'd like to push that boundary by brewing an 8.5% ale and wonder what to expect. Common sense says that this constitutes <strong>stressing the yeast</strong>, so one would expect the normal things that go along with that, like under-attenuation, stuck fermentations, increased esters.</p>

"AG brewing newbie, can only hit 50% efficiency, what's going wrong?","<p>I've done 2 one-gallon AG brews now, and both have hit approx. 50% efficiency. I thought I'd fixed what was obviously wrong between the two, but the second one still looks like it's going to come out at about 2% ABV... I wondered if anyone could tell me what I am likely to be doing wrong?</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<p>I'm aware this is a rather 'rustic' setup! If it's simply a case of needing better equipment then good to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heated 1 1/2 quarts of water per lb of grain to 160F in a stock pot</li>
<li>Added grain and stirred, temp got down to approx. 150F</li>
<li>Put stock pot in a pre-heated (and turned off) oven, and left for 60 mins, checking temp every 15 mins, I was pretty confident I stayed between 148-160 (it got a bit hot at first but I stirred until cooler)</li>
<li>Poured mash into large fine mesh colander over bucket</li>
<li>Then slowly poured 170f water heated in separate pans over the top, trying to cover as much of the grain as possible</li>
<li>This took about 15 mins before hitting 1 1/2 gallons pre-boil volume</li>
<li>Cleaned out stock-pot, added colander on top and recirculated wort through grains</li>
<li>Then brought to a rolling boil and followed hop schedule</li>
<li>Then cooled in 20 mins to 75F in an ice bath</li>
<li>Poured through fine mesh strainer into fermenter</li>
<li>Was slightly below 1 gallon (probably due to large stock pot, big surface area) so topped up with water, but not much</li>
<li>Pitched yeast etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Was aiming for OG of 1.050 (it's an APA), and I've hit 1.035... which is obviously not great. Where is the most likely misstep? I'm thinking sparging, as the water got through so quickly...</p>

"Adding Sugar before primary fermentation and a few associate Gravity Questions","<p>I mentioned in a previous question that I am about to have a go at my first home brew.  This was prompted when the brother-in-law's girlfriend gave me a beer kit for Christmas (Tom Caxton Real Ale).  I had thought about having a go at this a few times over the years so this was just the gentle push I needed. I am also aware that it is just as easy nowadays to create a homebrew without the need for a kit, but there's no harm in starting out with one either.</p>

<p>I have done a lot of reading around the science behind home brewing and I fully on board with the theory of ""never follow the kits instructions"" (which would ultimately have me add my LME kit to 1 gallon of warm water and then top up with 4 gallons of cold water and leave it).  </p>

<p>So I am going to follow one of the methods I have read - the boil, hot break, bittering hops etc. etc.</p>

<p>My question (and I do spot the irony/hypocrisy in this) relates to the beer kit says to add 1kg of brewing sugar to the mix prior to primary fermentation, but one of the in depth brewing guides I read (John Palmer's 'How to Brew') says never to follow that step as, in times gone by malt extract producers have tended to adulterate their products with sugar already.  However, in the same breath, he says the homebrewing has come a long way recently and producers are starting to take more pride in their work.  </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>do I or don't I add brewing sugar prior to primary fermentation?  </li>
<li>My understanding is that LME typically yields 34 to 38 points at OG, so for a 5 gallon batch, I would likely need 5 lbs of LME to achieve 1.034 to 1.038 OG.  But my kit purports to make 5 gallons/40 pints yet it only has 4 lbs of LME.  This would mean a likely lower OG yield would it not?</li>
<li>If my assumption at 2. is correct, would the additional brewing sugar help to increase the OG? And would the additional sugar be fermentable or would it just remain suspended in the final beer?</li>
</ol>

<p>While the ABV of my resulting brew is a secondary concern, I also don't want a brew that is safe to drive with (FYI - I absolutely do not condone drink driving).</p>

<p>I know that a lot of the fermentation process will also depend on the quality of the yeast, which is why I will invest in a named brand rather than use the pack provided with my kit.</p>

<p>Also interested to hear thoughts on whether using the brewing sugar for primary fermentation would affect the taste or body of the final brew.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance all.</p>

<p>If I mash twice the grain for my 5 gallon IPA recipe, then just boil the ~6 gallons of wort (and double the hop additions), can I then split the higher OG 5 gallons of wort into two fermenters (2.5 gallons in each) and top off each fermenter with another 2.5 gallons of distilled water each?</p>

"Controlling fermentation temperatures","<p>I'm conscious this is the third question I've asked before I even get started on my first brew, but hey-ho; better to learn from the experience of others and get as close to ""right"" first time.</p>

<p>My problem is that where I live currently (north west England) the outside air temperature is a crisp 4-8C during the day dropping to freezing at night.  The impact of this is that even with regular central heating, the best indoor range of air temperature I can get is between 15C (lowest) and 18.5C (highest) - having taken regular test readings at intermittent intervals throughout a few days - and I am not sure how these factors would impact on the temperature of my brew and fermentation.  I don't have a home thermostat in order to keep a constant, so the indoor temperature fluctuates with the timed on/off intervals of my central heating (presently 1.5 hours at 6am, 1 hour at midday and 2 hours from 5-7pm).</p>

<p>I had considered a number of options to maintain a decent temperature including heat mats and brew belts and I am comfortable with the pros and cons of each and their potential effects on the brew.  I have ruled out more expensive thermostatic options as too expensive to blow on my first brew.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on how they would maintain a suitable temp during fermentation with these conditions? Has or does anyone currently brew ales in these conditions with positive results? </p>

<p>Interestingly, I have read that active fermentation can warm a brew by 5-8C, so assuming I get the fermentation going in the correct range, is it possible that the heat given off during fermentation could actually keep my brew in the correct range anyway?</p>

"specific gravity too high to bottle?","<p>I recently brewed the Brewer's Best Milk Stout, which uses LME plus lactose and maltodextrin. The original gravity was 1.060, which is within the specs for offered in the instructions. Now after about 1 month in secondary, the beer is is holding steady at 1.030, which is apparently too high (specs indicate 1.020 - 1.024). I'm nervous to bottle in case they will explode.</p>

<p>I tried adding some dry ale yeast (Safale US-05) to try and kick the fermentation on, and even added a little heat with a brief water bath, but after one week there is no change. Furthermore, the room im fermenting in ranges from about 65-70 degrees, so it seems unlikely to have become stuck from low temperature. Also, the beer tastes fine right now, but I don't have the experience to tell whether it's ""too sweet"".</p>

<p>Two potential issues come to mind. First, I spaced out and failed to add the lactose and maltodextrin to the boil -- they were added just before racking into the primary. Perhaps these non-fermentables didn't see as much conversion to fermentables as they might have? Second, I may not have used a temperature conversion for the original gravity, so perhaps the OG was actually higher than 1.060, and the 1.030 really is indicating a greater amount of non-fermentable sugar than I am expecting?</p>

<p>What should I do? I'm tempted to just bottle it, since my hunch is that the high FG indicates a lot of non-fermentables, but perhaps I should try adding some more yeast of some kind? What kind?</p>

"Amount of oak chips","<p>I'm brewing an imperial stout. It will have 10-12% ABV in the end (hopefully). I never used wood chips before, but want to add it to this beer. I read through guides but I read everything from just 24 hours to 2 months. </p>

<p>I have about 12 liters of the stout and want to add the chips next week after primary fermentation is done.
<strong>How much do I add and how long?</strong></p>

<p>I would prefer to do it for 2 weeks as I'm on vacation that time. My plan would be to fill a 100-150ml glas with the chips, soak them in whisky, drain, add to a bag and add the to the fermenter. Is this reasonable?
It would be better to be on the safe side and to don't have an overwhelming wood character.</p>

<p>If it matters, the beer will be bottled after the secondary and I want to wait until winter to drink it.</p>

"Pitching kombucha starter instead of yeast","<p>My friend recently gave me the idea of making a kombucha-inoculated beer. Having never done it before, the principle seems fairly straightforward to me (this is my own guesswork):</p>

<ol>
<li>Ferment kombucha as normal (done!)</li>
<li>Prepare base beer recipe/wort, let it cool</li>
<li>Pitch enough kombucha starter to inoculate wort (for my 8L batch, about 1L of starter according to normal <em>kombucha</em> ratios)</li>
<li>Let it ferment normally as with any other yeast pitch</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that this would inoculate the wort with the bacteria and yeast I want (Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces). It, in theory, should slightly sour and acidify the wort, and of course ferment it. Let's assume I have an OG of about 1.060 using primarily 2-row malt, nothing too high.</p>

<p>There are a few things I'm not sure about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is approximately 1/8 wort volume enough kombucha starter to get fermentation going (1L for 8L of wort)?</li>
<li>Can the kombucha SCOBY actually ferment down the beer appropriately (e.g. below 1.020) - or do I need to pitch additional yeast?</li>
<li>Will hop additions during the boil later kill the bacteria in the SCOBY when I pitch?</li>
<li>Am I doing this all wrong and there's a better way?</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that the end product should be a fermented, slightly sour and acidic wort with more or less the same qualities as kombucha in terms of flavor, but with a slight malt backbone.</p>

<p>PS - I could use some other Lactobacillus-laden product to sour the wort, but I thought that since I have mature kombucha sitting on my counter I may as well use it!</p>

"Oversparging grainfather","<p>Most of my beers where I live now have been astringent (5 or so). Some more some less. I found one of the culprits after lots of research: I have incredibly high alkalinity (400ppm CaCO3). So I have decided to mix my own water with destilled water and the usual salts. Now I am worried about oversparging. Presuming I construct ideal water and calculate my mash and sparge water using the usual method, do I still need to worry about oversparging? If so how do I go about avoiding this on the grainfather? I've never read a detailed technique anyway. Keep sampling the sparge runoff every 5 mins and test the pH using a meter?</p>

"Solid sugar to primary","<p>Next weekend I’m planning to brew a tripel and the recipe includes some table sugar. I usually add the sugar a few days in, after high krausen to reduce the stress on the yeast (= no starter required) in the form of a boiled-cooled sugar solution. But this brew is going to take place at my parents and myself won’t be around during the week(s) after to make the solution. I don’t want to bother the old folks with the amount of work and responsibility to make the solution, so I was wondering, why not add the sugar to the beer in its solid, powder form? It is much less work to dump it straight in.</p>

<p>There are a few drawbacks I could think of. One is the sugar not dissolving. When it is dumped in, it will probably make a pile at the bottom of the fermenter. I think it eventually will all dissolve and due to the activity of the yeast there is a ‘flow’ in the liquid. The other one is sanitation.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Go or no-go?</p>

"Carbonation dissipates very quickly after opening bottled beer","<p>I finished a German Wheat beer that I kettle soured and then I made a franken-beer shandy with a couple of gallons of the leftover wort. Neither of these beers seems to have kept their carbonation.</p>

<p>The first beer was force carbed. When filling I did not bleed my keg, I just lowered the pressure and then bottled with 2-3 psi from the keg using a Last Straw bottle filler. Since my filler is a Last Straw, it can purge O2 and then fill easily. It fills by pressing the nozzle to the bottom of the bottle to let the beer flow and fill.</p>

<p>More often than not it foams like crazy so I fill a bottle as best as I can and then move on to maybe 1-2 more than go back and top off the first bottle and cap it.</p>

<p>I don't think that amount of time could affect my carbonation that much could it? I'm not getting any off-flavors from oxidation or anything in my beers.</p>

<p><em>Note: When force carbing the keg was rolled on its side like usual until the regulator was silent.</em></p>

<p>The shandy was low and slow and was keg carbonated and is carbonated when served from the keg.</p>

<p>Now opening the bottles at a homebrewer meeting there is initial carbonation but then it dissipates rapidly and then there is barely some residual carbonation in the beer and no head at all (previously had a nice creamy one) or much discernable carb. I also filled a vacuum-sealed growler with my shandy beer and it also had no carb when it was opened.</p>

"Cider Issues - identical batches acting differently","<p>Here's a strange one. I pressed a large load of apples a week ago, getting just over 26 litres. I let it sit for a day in a single Fermenting bin with a dose of Camden to clear up wild yeast and a scoop of yeast nutrients.</p>

<p>I then transferred half the juice to a second bin, chose not to add sugar as the sp was coming in at a healthy 1.090, added my yeast equally, sealed up with identical air locks and left in a spare room. Within 24 hours, one bin was bubbling away quite happily, developing a good frothy top. The other, nothing. Slowly, over the next few days, it started to fizz but no froth and no sign of any bubbling. </p>

<p>After 6 days I cracked it open and it smelt pretty pungent which gave me confidence. I added some more nutrients and yeast and it fizzed away happily for a few hours, though still no bubbling through the air-lock. </p>

<p>Really don't understand how one bin can be doing all the right things whilst the other not so. Should I just leave it for another week and then transfer to Demijohn? Mix the two back together and then into Demijohns? Put in yet more Yeast? Is seems like its Fermenting but why no air lock action? </p>

"Old ginger bug not bubbling anymore - could it still be alive in spite of no bubbles","<p>I have an old ginger bug (my first) that I have had going for a few months and used a couple of times to make ginger beer with great results.</p>

<p>Last couple of months, though, I haven't been able to take proper care of it. It was in the refrigerator for a month without feeding. When I took it out a while back, it was flat with all the ginger settled at the bottom, but with a healthy accumulation of white stuff (yeast &amp; bacteria) at the bottom of the jar.</p>

<p>I wanted to get the bubbling activity going again so I fed it a few times with no success. After that, it's been in and out of the refrigerator a few times, with some more attempts at reviving it (sometimes I have forgotten feeding it for a week while it's sitting on a shelf in the pantry), but nothing has happened.</p>

<p>It looks alright (there's no mold), it smells alcoholic and gingery, it has a hazy orange-brown colour and a white ring of microbes at the bottom. I'm not sure if the yeast and bacteria are still alive and capable of fermenting a new batch of ginger beer.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the bug safe? (Considering it was outside the refrigerator without feeding for over a week.) Should I just throw it out and start afresh?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if I leave an old/mature ginger bug outside the refrigerator without feeding for a few days?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If it's safe:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>Is the bug alive? Apart from the bubbling, is there any other way of knowing that it's alive?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there something I can do to revive it, or is it incapable of reviving?</p></li>
<li><p>If the bug is not bubbling, could it still be alive and capable of fermenting a new batch of ginger beer (considering the alcoholic smell and the presence of the white ring at the bottom)? Could I just take a chance and see if it works (provided it's safe)?</p></li>

"Is dry hopping a carbonated beer effective?","<p>Would it be effective to dry hop a beer that has been kegged and carbonated? More specifically, can I open the keg and drop in some dry hops for a week even after I have carbonated the beer?</p>

<p>If it's feasible, what temperature should I dry hop at?</p>

<p>I brewed and kegged a blonde ale which I was hoping would have a noticeable hop aroma. The results are only so-so. It could be that Calypso hops don't stand out as noticeably when used for aroma, or that the honey malt aroma is overpowering the hops. Or both.</p>

"Will yeast clean up diacetyl generated in a sour mash?","<p>I have a sour mash that is going on 48 hours, and I'm hoping to press it closer to 72 as I like my sours bitter enough to strip the enamel off my teeth.  Problem is by 24 hours (last night), I went to go check on the temperature, and it was very clear that heterofermentative lacto had settled in.  The moment the lid came off, I had a walloping butter smell that required every window be opened to air it out. It was the most intense smell of diacetyl I think I'll ever encounter.</p>

<p>I heated the mash up to 140-150, ensuring that I kill off any bad (and good for that matter) bacteria, pitched dregs from a few sours (was too late to go pick up a vial at the homebrew store, had to swing by the liquor store instead).  I let the mash cool down to 120, pitched in the dregs, and maintained temp again.  The smell is still present, although not nearly as intense, and it certainly isn't getting any worse since killing it off.</p>

<p>My question is, once I go to ferment this wort, I'll pitch a dry English Ale yeast (WLP007).  Will this (or any) yeast clean up whatever diacetyl remains in the mash as well as the diacetyl generated by the yeast during fermentation?  I assume boiling won't kill off the flavor?</p>

<p>Update:  It has been nearly two weeks and I am still getting very obvious buttery diacetyl characters in both the the aroma and the flavor.  At this point it is difficult to tell whether the diacetyl has decreased during aging, but if I had to guess, I would suspect that it hasn't by any noticeable degree.  It is a very low gravity beer, sitting at 3% ABV, so these sorts of off flavors really stand out. I was given the the suggestion elsewhere to get a yeast starter going and to pitch it at high krausen.  While I dont see the harm in trying (other than wasting time and effort) is it worth the attempt when the diacetyl is still so prevalent?  Am I too impatient at two weeks despite the low gravity?</p>

<p>I have a cider that I have made following the steps on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La38oQjdyPw"" rel=""nofollow"">CraigTube</a> for his Hard Apple Cider. The only difference is that I have used Champagne yeast and the batch is 22L. I know you are all going to say to check my hydrometer reading but unfortunately I smashed the hydrometer before I could take the initial reading. The airlock still has activity and is still bubbling after 18 days. It is bubbling strongly every 13 seconds. How will I know when it is done. Should I wait until the airlock has no activity at all?</p>

<p>Recipe here:</p>

<p>21L Juice (7bottles)</p>

<p>Yeast Nutrient (Boil up raisins (that don’t have sulphite on them) and small amount of water, mash up the raisins and simmer)</p>

<p>10- 14Cup’s corn sugar or dextrose (the more sugar the more kick it will have)</p>

<p>1 Lalvin EC1118 Yeast</p>

<p>Steps</p>

<ol>
<li>Boil up yeast nutrient and mash up raisins</li>
<li>Take out a little juice from the bottle and add sugar.</li>
<li>Shake out the sugar(even do this for the fermenter batch as it saves time and stiring)</li>
<li>Put in the yeast nutrient(make sure that it isn’t still too hot) and shake the bottle</li>
<li>Add the yeast and shake the bottle
a.  If you are making a fermenter size batch then pour it all in the fermenter</li>
<li>Leave that until the fermenter has stopped bubbling and leave for a few days.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok I have done a small scale test. I have had 1.5L of juice and 1cup sugar(200grams)
The reading was 1.092. This test does not include the boiled up rasins.</p>

<p>Ok so another reading has been taken. This is 1.000</p>

"What is the most popular method of brewing beer?","<p>I am a beginner and as a beginner almost everything tells you to use malt extracts to brew your beer.  So after a few batches I think I am ready to move up but I am wondering if it's worth the extra work.  Is the beer really better?  Does it require a lot more work?</p>

<p>One big question I have is do most people progress onto all grain brews or do they stay with the extract brews for simplicity?  </p>

<p>I ask because I am starting a service that will deliver a new recipe's ingredients to your door every month.  I can't decide if the recipes should be for all grain or extract brews, so I am really trying to get a consensus. I may just let everyone pick which one they want if it is a mixed opinion.</p>

"Primary Fermentation Plastic Bucket Lid","<p>I just started homebrewing and a couple of friends told me my airlock on my plastic bucket primary should be bubbling.  After 3 days of primary fementing with dry yeast, I've seen nothing, but, you can see through the bucket that there is two inches of foam on top of the wort.  In addition, when you push on the lid, the odor of the wort is strong.  So, I'm thinking that there isn't a good seal on the bucket.  I have two questions.  Is this a problem?  How do I fix it?</p>

"Adding hopped tea at the start of fermentation","<p>I have a Muntons Premium Larger Kit and have purchased some hops to add some aroma. </p>

<p>The hops I am using are called Wakatu (Hallertau Aroma) pellets.</p>

<p>The instructions I have from the home brew store is to steep 15-30 grams of hop pellets in boiled water then add the water(hop tea) and the hop bag to the fermenter. From what I understand this is done at the start of the brewing process when you are mixing the sugar, water, and Muntons Kit before the yeast goes in. The hop bag then stays in for the duration of the fermenting through till the bottling stage. No secondary is being done.</p>

<p>Will this give a sufficient hoppy flavor to the beer? I want to keep things simple as this is the first time I am dealing with hops but at the same time I still want to get a nice flavor out of them.

"Triple Fermented?? But Why?","<p>Some beers claim to be triple fermented, meaning that after primary fermentation, more fermentables are added at the start of secondary, and then the brew is bottle-conditioned, resulting in three separate additions of sugars.</p>

"Final Gravity on the Refractormeter vs. the Hydrometer","<p>I've been brewing the same recipe now for several batches.  It's my house beer.  A Kolsch-style beer.  While I have followed the same recipe for each attempt, I'm sure there has been some variances in how it is brewed.  Specifically, I know that the mash temperature has been a little different each time.</p>

<p>One of the pieces of information that I have been keeping at each attempt is the gravity readings on brew day, when I rack primary to secondary, and when I keg the beer.  At each point, I've been reading gravity with both my hydrometer and my refractometer.  Of course, at the beginning of fermentation, the reading are the same.  At secondary and kegging, they are different.</p>

<p>While the FG reading on the hydrometer has always ended up at 1.010, what I've noticed is that on some batches, the FG reading on the refractometer has ranged from about 1.026 to 1.023.</p>

<p>My question is this:  Is there any way to correlate the mash temperature to the variances in the refractometer reading?  Does this have anything to do with simple sugar to dextrin ratios?  What does this all mean?</p>

"I need some clarification on the use of Lactose","<p>I am going to try to brew a Russian Imperial Stout with the intent to have something more along the lines of a High Gravity/Desserty type beer similar to Bells Batch 9000.  I am using a kit recipe and modifying it with a little less hops, adding cocoa and vanilla bean with bourbon and american oak with lactose for body/sweetness.
I am very familiar with alcoholic fermentation because I make wine for a living.  I will be kegging this beer and the bourbon will be added post fermentation so no need to warn me on the cautionary ABV.
I am trying to sort through all the information in my literature and through the grapevine (literally) what I hear about brewing and I am finding what I would consider mixed information on the use of lactose in beer.
I understand lactose's use but I see people adding it to the wort instead of the finished beer.  I would think that having a non-fermentable sugar would stress the yeast and risk an incomplete or stinky fermentation.  Is lactose normally added before or after fermentation and why?
Also, any good videos on all-grain brewing?</p>

"Temperature swing of 10+ degrees during fermentation","<p>I'm fermenting a porter, and pitched the yeast at about 75°F (24°C) on Sunday night (4 days ago).

There was 2 solid days of really active fermentation at this temperature.  However, there's been a couple really cold nights, and now the CO2 bubbling out has slowed dramatically.  The temperature got down to 65 yesterday, so I put a space heater near it, and it's now up to 76°F (24.5°C) - but the fermentation still seems really slow.</p>

So, I am considering clarifying the mix and starting over with the fermentation. Will probably have to adjust the pH to get back to a yeast friendly wort.</p>

<p>Will clarifying at this point remove fermentable sugars? My understanding is that clarifying removes suspended solids and not dissolved sugars. Is this true? Will this give me a more accurate gravity measurement/max abv calculation? Should I just clarify and bottle this as a sweet light beer at this point (abv estimated @ 4%) instead of going for the higher abv desired at the start of this batch?</p>

"Premature fermentation of wine must. What to do?","<p>I recently took delivery of a five gallon pail of white wine juice.

Is this right? Not sure I'm going to get through 5 gallons that quick so if this is true, I may think about investing in glass and crown caps before bottling day.</p>

<p>Also, I don't have a fridge big enough to stand 40 bottles upright.  I'm assuming that laid flat is fine (after allowing conditioning at room temp for a while) provided the beer gets a good bit of time upright to settle before opening and pouring to leave any small amounts of sediment in the bottle?</p>

<p>25g Dr Rudi hops - 15min boil - 11.7% AA</p>

<p>75g El Dorado hops - 15min boil - 14.1% AA</p>

"How will this beer turn out?","<p>I brewed my first all grain beer on Sunday; everything went well barring one leaky tap and a slight blockage on the tap in my kettle due to a poor hop filter. It is supposed be an IPA style beer using all Maris otte pale malt with Columbus, citra and pioneer hops. The yeast I used was danstar nottingham. OG was 1055</p>

<p>I live in an apartment in the UK and struggle to drop the temp below 24 celcius (75F). Because I know the optimum temp for nottingham is below 21C (70F) I added a wet T-shirt over the beer to keep it cool. When I did my first gravity check after the first day (fermentation looked very vigorous) I found that the temp was still up at 24C and the gravity has already dropped to 1019! Since then I have dropped it into a nice bath with the wet shirt wicking up the water but I'm worried that I'll get a huge number of bad flavours and 'hotness' from all of the fusel alcohols etc associated with hot fermentation. </p>

<p>Is there any way to counteract this? I understand that time fixes these problems but I was hoping to have a good idea of how this recipe works so I can refine it in my next brew, if I can't taste it properly I might have to wing the next brew.</p>

<p>I am planning to dry hop and wondered if this would remove any of the nastiness?</p>

<p>Because the beer I am brewing is so floraly and citrusy a lot of the mango etc off flavours mith actually be useful, it's mainly the hotness I want to remove.</p>

11 lbs Marris Otter (2.0 SRM)<br>
2 lbs 9.6 oz    Caraamber (30.0 SRM)<br>

1 lbs 11.8 oz   Caramel/Crystal Malt - 60L (60.0 SRM)<br>
11.2 oz Special B Malt (180.0 SRM)  </p>

<p>Yeastex and Whirfloc at the recommended dosages for good measure.</p>

<p>I performed a 65 minute single mash. I mashed in at around 165 F and the mash rest occurred at around 155 F. I was able to extract nearly 5 gallons of wort. I batch sparged at 178 F, and the batch rest occurred for about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The boil was 60 minutes with a very healthy hop schedule.</p>

<p>I copper coil chilled to about 78 F before pitching two vials of White Labs California Ale yeast. No starter. The first phase of fermentation occurred the way it usually does. There was a nice bubble in the airlock, with a solid couple inches of trub. 17 days have passed. I checked the gravity for the first time and the hydrometer measured 1.040. </p>

<p>This has me a bit concerned. I am still fairly novice to the all-grain game. I know but am not certain that big Crystal malts carry a lot of complex sugars that take the yeast extended periods of time to act on (Disachharides?). Did I mash too hot? Did I use too much Crystal? Why are the yeast responding so poorly to what would otherwise be considered a healthy brew? I am worried that the FG won't sink below 1.030 (this happened a month ago with a slightly different recipe). Would it be heinous to boil up some belgian candy and introduce it to the fermenting device to get the gravity low enough to bottle?</p>

<p>So; is it a good or bad idea? Otherwise i thought of carbonating in the carboy, but with a plug that would pop if the the pressure was was too much, and just bottle them when it does.</p>

<p>Any advices ? thanks!</p>

"Ginger bug does not produce enough carbonation","<p>I am using the following recipe to grow an active ginger bug:</p>

<p>2 cups bottled water
2 tbsp grated organic ginger
2 tbs refined sugar</p>

<p>Each day I add 2 tbsp ginger and 2 tbsp sugar to the mix. I wash all my utensils with bottled water before using. I use a plastic spoon for stirring. Temperature ranges between 22 C and 28 C.</p>

<p>After 24h the bug is showing signs of fizziness, but only small bubbles. This doesn’t change significantly after 48h. After 72h it goes flat and if I keep feeding it will eventually develop a slight film of mold on top. </p>

<p>If, however I start brewing the ale after 48h have passed (for syrup I use 2L water, 54g ginger, 273g sugar, 3 lemons, brought to room temp and mixed with 100g ginger bug liquid) it will not develop enough carbonation after 3rd day of bottling. It does have some fizziness but it’s not near to making a “pop” sound when the bottle is opened or have proper carbonation when poured in a glass. The liquid also seems sweet enough, so I would say it is probably not a case of all of it being eaten away by the bug in the ale.</p>

<p>I have tried numerous times and the outcome is the same: either flat bug by day 3 OR not enough carbonation if I use the bug on day 2 for making ale.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Can anyone please help? I have read all sorts of advice and tried to mitigate sources of error having to do with ingredients, so I can’t tell what it is that I’m doing wrong, especially because everyone says this is the easiest recipe to get right :)</p>

"STC 1000 safety","<p>sorry if this is a question that’s been answered already. I’ve just completed a brew for a Belgian saison using wyeast 3724 and I’ve suffered the all to common stall that this yeast so often experiences. As the ambient temp in my home is circa 19c, I decided to try and kickstart the yeast back into action by raising the temp (this yeast is happier in the late 20s and up to 32 according to wyeast site). </p>

<p>So I invested in a mangrove jacks heat pad as well as their dual temp controller (which is simply and branded stc 1000). </p>

<p>My question is twofold (I’m not an electrician and don’t profess to know anything about how it works):</p>

<p>1 - as I’m looking to get the temp initially to about 25 or 26c and hold it there, I won’t need a cooling aspect (i.e. fridge) as the room will slowly bring the temp down and the hysteresis setting will see to it that it doesn’t drop far. But is it okay / safe to just leave the cooling socket empty? I.e. the controller won’t burn itself out trying to drive something that’s not there? (I accept this might be a really stupid question)</p>

<p>2 - with the ambient room temp at 19 and a target of 25 or 26c, the heat pad is probably going to be put through its paces and spend quite a decent amount of time switched on and heating (it’s currently been on for 6 hours straight which is what it’s taken to heat my brew from 21 to 24c). It’s a 25w pad. Anyone know if these are robust enough to just hook up to the stc 1000 and leave them to do their thing like that?</p>

"What caused my wort to be this cloudy, and how can I get it to clear?","<p>I recently did two experimental all-grain gluten-free batches, and got some strange results; so much sediment that it looks like milk! Initially, looked about the same, and I thought about running through a filter, but decided to see if it would settle at all. After 5 days, this was the result. These do not have yeast in them, as I decided that I might filter and re-boil.</p>

<p>To the left is Batch 2, the shorter mash with the longer cereal cooking step which looks like rice-milk with only an inch or so clear at the top, to the right is Batch 1, which was the over-night mash. It looks almost normal now, but the trub layer is thicker than what I am used to seeing come straight out of a kettle... (Albeit this is only my third all-grain brew...)
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKdco.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKdco.jpg"" alt=""Left: Batch2, which is almost entirely a milky white. Right: Batch1, which looks ok other than the trub taking up a quarter of the jug.""></a></p>

<p><strong>My questing is what could have caused these (especially batch 2) to be so ridiculously cloudy?</strong> 
I am guessing this might simply be small flour particles, but then why would batch 1 be clear of them?
Is it possible the higher temp of cooking in Batch 2 extracted more protien?
Is that related to the high gravity reading?</p>

<p>Perhaps my temperature control temperature on batch 2 was lacking, or the enzymes are not as potent as stated and failed to achieve complete conversion of starch? Could this result in cloudy wort? Why would the gravity reading be the same then?</p>

<p><strong>A second question would be how on earth can I filter this?</strong> A coffee filter would surely just clog right up, and this stuff is so small it can go right through a fine mesh bag like it's nothing. Is there any practical way to filter these? 
Is it possible that after fermenting, the whole thing would settle out somehow? Maybe it just needs more time? Like months?</p>

<p><strong>-Details-</strong>
For any possible relevant details I can think of... Here's the whole process. (These are 1 gallon batches.)
10 oz white rice
13 oz millet</p>

<p>Grains were not malted. 
Ground in a bur grinder set to it's most course setting, which resulting in a mix of particle sizes from what looks about corn-meal size down to very fine flour.</p>

<p>2L of 'strike' water was used. (About 1.5 qt / lbs)
In both cases, the mash became thick and hard to stir before enzyme was added, and thinned very quickly afterward.</p>

<p>The enzymes are SEBAMYL BAL and SEBAMYL L. According to the seller, they are best used together in a ""Reverse Step Mash"", adding BAL first at 165, then adding L later at 145.</p>

<p>The mash is where the two experiments diverge.</p>

<p>Batch 1: Kettle on stove, keeping burner on very low to maintain temp.
Raise temp to 185 F, stir and cook for 20 minutes.
Wait for temp to lower temp to 165F, then add first enzyme.
After 60 minutes, lower temp to 145 F and add second enzyme.
I started doing did iodine tests after an hour, and after 2 hours still had indications of starch.
I decided to let it go overnight, using an oven to hold it near 145.
Iodine test still turned purple. Wort looked thin and tasted sweet though, so I decided to continue anyway.</p>

<p>Batch 2 was done in an InstantPot pressure cooker, generally leaving heat off and relying on it's insulation to keep temp.
Same grain &amp; water etc.
Cook at 212 for 30 minutes, stirring constantly. 
Cool to 155, then slowly raise to 165. (To help ensure temp reading is correct.)
Added first enzyme and leave for an hour.
Cool to 145, add second enzyme, and hold for 2 hours. 
This also failed the iodine test, turning dark purple immediately.
I figured the iodine test might be picking up flour particles, so I decided to ignore it and call the mash done.</p>

<p>The 'sparge' step was the same for each. It was just me pouring a measured amount of warm water over the grains as they sat in a nylon mesh bag over a pot. This was done to help recover some of the sugars that would otherwise be lost between the grains.</p>

<p>After this, I took gravity readings of each using a hydrometer. Samples were taken from each kettle and cooled to 68F (the hydro's calibrated temp.)
Both read 1.045, which is really weird to me, because I was expecting 23 oz of grain to yeild at most 1.025, of sugars...</p>

<p>Added hops (pellet, but kept in muslin cloth bag), boiled both for 60 minutes, added about 1/4 tablet of whirlfloc in the last 10 minutes, chilled with immersion chiller, then racked. I did not add yeast, because I immediately noticed that they were both way too cloudy.</p>

"Why do very dark roasted malts have such a high steeping yield?","<p>According to Palmer's popular <a href=""http://howtobrew.com/book/section-2/what-is-malted-grain/table-of-typical-malt-yields"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of typical mashing and steeping yields</a>, pale crystal malt (25-40L) has a typical steeping yield of 22 PPG. Slightly darker crystal malt (medium, 60-75L) weighs in at 18 PPG when steeped, and dark crystal (120L) at 16 PPG. Fine, that makes sense: darker crystal malts have lower steeping yields, consistent with how they behave when mashed.</p>

<p>But then we get to roasted barley and black patent malt, which both have a much lower yield when mashed, but are both listed as having typical steeping yields of 21 PPG.</p>

"Question about Ginger Bug","<p>I'm very new to brewing and also fermentation and I'm really confused when I start fermenting my ginger bug. I don't know when to screw my bottle tight and when to put a cheese cloth on top of the bottle and when to use airlock during the brewing process. </p>

<p>I guess..</p>

<p>To put cheese cloth during first fermentation so I can capture more wild yeast into the bottle? But then if it start bubbling, the bubble will go away. Also it is suggested I shake the bottle every day, do I put the lid on, shake it and switch it back to cheese cloth?</p>

<p>To screw the bottle tight in 2nd fermentation is to keep the Co2 in the bottle to make the drink fizzy.</p>

<p>To use airlock is when you try to brew alcohol beverage and you will feed more sugar to the yeast and it will be a longer fermentation, using airlock will let Co2 escape the bottle safely.</p>

<p>So am I right? </p>

<p>But I see people using airlock during first fermentation and some people make fruit yeast water in a tightly screwed jar, so I got confused. I hope someone can help me to understand. Thank you very much.</p>

"Finicky Wyeast 3724 Stall","<p>Looking for some useful suggestions. I’m a veritable noob when it comes to brewing. I’m on my second brew and already trying to experiment with my own recipe albeit sticking to extract / specialty grains. </p>

<p>Trying to do a saison style beer and landed on Wyeast 3724 for my chosen yeast. Brew went relatively straightforward and hit my target OG on the nose @ 1.062. </p>

<p>Into 5gal glass carboy for primary, pitched yeast and fitted blow off tube. A day in and super glad I used a blowoff as kreusen to the brim and into the tube. </p>

<p>6 days into fermentation and activity completely ceased. Took a sample and OG only dropped 20 points to 1.042. </p>

<p>Now I’ve since read about problems that come with this yeast and that it is know to start vigorously and stall out around this point sometimes for weeks and weeks. </p>

<p>I also didn’t know about the high temps need for the yeast so the first week was done at 18c. At day 8 or 9 I ramped temps to 27c and held it there since. Now 16 days in and things are moving painfully slow. I’m in no rush but keep second guessing it and thinking I should dump and start again, perhaps with 3711 instead. </p>

<p>I don’t want to pitch another yeast (but would use US05 if I did). So aside from the temp increase I’m thinking I could rouse the yeast some way. </p>

<p>That’s where my question comes in - any suggestions about how to rouse it? I can’t give the FV much movement as the kreusen really caked onto the glass and I don’t want any of that to mix back into the wort.  Is there anything else I could try?</p>

<p>If it helps, recipe was:</p>

<p>8lbs extra light DME
1.25lbs Crystal 20L
1lb clear Belgian Candi sugar</p>

<p>Steeped crystal for 30 mins @ 160f</p>

<p>60 min boil of 3gal topped off with water to make 5gal total in FV. </p>

"Microbial interactions: biotransformations and food/drink science","<p>I am looking for a good, in-depth source on biotransformations (think food science). For example, fermenting black tea and sugar with wild yeast and bacteria (kombucha):</p>

<ol>
<li>Wild yeast ferment sucrose into ethanol</li>
<li>Bacteria (in the presence of oxygen) convert that ethanol to acetic acid (sours the solution and lowers pH)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a transformation of sucrose into acetic acid through the use of yeast and bacteria (but which ones?). Or:</p>

<ol>
<li>Malting grain causes production of enzymes that later break down starch into sugar</li>
<li>Mashing crushed grain allows starch extraction and conversion (by these enzymes) to (fermentable) sugars such as maltrose, dextrose, sucrose, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm interested in what enzymes are produced by which grains, and how they convert starches and in what temperature ranges.</p>

<p>I want to study these types of biotransformations, including how varieties of yeast and bacteria make these transformations (i.e. bacteria converting ethanol to acetic acid only when oxygen is present). This means details on yeast, bacteria, and how they interact with one another in transformations of molecules (thus aromatic/flavor compounds, production of alcohol and acids, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Is there an authoritative (or close to it) source on the micro-level biotransformations that occur during fermentation</strong>? I only know what I know from reading online about brewing kombucha and beer; sources seem to just say ""this happens when this"", but without explanations as to <em>what is doing what</em>, which is what I want to know more about!</p>

<p><em>Super bonus points</em> if there's a sort of almanac of common brewing ingredients. For example, breakdown of various malts and their enzyme content, adjuncts such as herbs/spices and their chemical makeup (e.g. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linalool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linalool</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citronellol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">citronellol</a>, etc.), the like.

"Will baked bottles stay sanitized if kept inverted?","<p>This site has quite a few post on how to <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/q/8063/1643"">clean and re-use bottles</a>.  In this <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/1207/1643"">community wiki</a>, we learn that by putting foil over the top of bottles and baking them for 60 minutes at 340, we will sterilize bottles. <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/17861"">Another mention</a> credits Palmer.</p>

<p>Beer cases are prepared with a clean paper towel on the bottom of the case (so any debris in the bottom of the case doesn't come into contact with the bottle).  Cleaned and rinsed bottles are placed into the case upside down (inverted).  The entire box is placed into a 170 degree oven until the glass gets to at least 170 degrees for one hour [<a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/10444/1643]"">https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/a/10444/1643]</a>.

<p>Now the entire box is removed from the oven and stored in a climate controlled environment (my closet), and left undisturbed.</p>

<p>How long will the bottles remain clean enough to fill without immersing in sanitizing solution?  Is this technique as effective as the aluminum foil technique, so allowing the bottles to be filled without further sanitizing no matter how much time passes?</p>

"How to recover from failed carbonation?","<p>Beer (extract-based English bitter) has been in bottles for 3 weeks at cellar temperature (~60-70 F) with very little carbonation occurring. </p>

<p>I can think of a few things I might have screwed up to get here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Under-primed. I used the low end of the recommended amount of corn sugar because I do want this to be only lightly carbonated.</p></li>
<li><p>Old caps. Some of the caps I used were a few years old. Possibly they couldn't hold the pressure (but the plastic liners didn't seem any stiffer than the ones on some new caps I have).</p></li>
<li><p>Didn't allow my bottles to dry sufficiently after sanitizing in bleach solution and killed the yeast.</p></li>

<li><p>After adding carbonation drops to a couple of bottles and waiting another week, there is still not much carbonation there (but maybe this is due to increased headspace in the bottles after adding the carbonation drops).</p></li>

"How long does clarification take given a refrigerator temperature level cold crash?","<p>In <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/2766/what-is-cold-crashing"">this question defining cold crashing</a>, there is some discussion of ramping the temperature down slowly over a long time, but then says quicker cold crashing is possible if the beer has already completed fermentation.</p>

<p>In this question, I'd like to explore an appropriate, quick, and effective cold crash technique on an ale that's had plenty of time to ferment and ""clean-up"".  And for this example, the purpose of cold crashing is primarily for settling.</p>

<p>Given the carboy is in a refrigerator which is turned on normally (no external temperature control), it will take some time for the heat to be removed from the volume of beer.  If the beer started at, say, 68F, with the refrigerator ""on"", there would be a ramp down, and within 6 hours, the beer would be at, say, 40F.  Then you'd wait Y hours as settling continued.</p>

<p>What range of Y would you expect 50% of the eventual settling to be done?  What range of Z would you expect 90% of the settling to be done?</p>

<p>Note that in this diagram, I have assumed that settling happens faster earlier, and slower later.  This may or may not be your experience (could be linear).  The blue line is the temperature of the beer.  The black line is the amount of settling over time, starting at no cold crash settling and ending when 90% of the eventual possible settling is done.</p>

"Why am I getting foam in my keg line when dispensing?","<p>I have a two-tap kegerator which I use to dispense commercial 5-gallon kegs.  My lines are about 3 feet long<sup>1</sup> and I keep my pressure at 10psi and my temperature relatively cold.</p>

<p>Whenever I draw from the tap, I get beer immediately.  It looks like a great pour.  But always, about half a second after opening the valve, the beer coming out turns foamy for about a second and then returns to normal.  This produces enough head that my glass always ends up being half foam.  If I have a pitcher that I'm filling, or if I have two glasses and I can run the pour from one to the other, the rest of the pour will be excellent with no foam.</p>

<p>Why does this happen?  I have always had this problem with my setup.  I used to keep my pressure at 15psi and dropped it to 10psi (and I like it - I think I'll end up on 11-12psi).  But that hasn't helped this problem at all.  I also tried lowering the temperature on the kegerator.  This also hasn't helped.  These are things that I feel are just general tips to try to reduce foam.  But I feel like there's something specifically wrong with my setup where air is getting in the line somehow.</p>

<p>This problem happens on both taps.  This problem happens no matter what keg I hook up.  I have used Kegcraft kegs from Half Acre Chicago, as well as commercial kegs from various craft brewers available in Chicago.  They all have the problem.  This problem has persisted across CO2 tanks as well.</p>

They came as part of a kit, and I did not cut them.  I don't know exactly how long they are, but they are sufficient length to change kegs, clean, and otherwise maintain the set.</p>

"Using juice as bottling sugar","<p>So, I have brewed a big batch of kombucha. Normally, the original gravity is 1.020.  But this time, I created a 1.016 batch.  After nine days, the gravity went to 1.014 and the pH to 3.4.  The kombucha organisms which produce acetic acid, the collagen? scoby, and carbonation leave a lot of residual sugar.  So, as an experiment, I am adding brett to eat that sugar.  I moved it into secondary fermentation and added Brett Trois.  When that is done, I will then bottle it.  I used a bottling calculator as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amount Being Packaged:  3 g / 11.3562 l</p>
  
  <p>Volumes of CO2:         3.0</p>
  
  <p>Temperature of Beer:    75F / 23.8889C</p>
  
  <p>CO2 in Beer:            0.78 volumes</p>
  
  <p>Priming Table Sugar:    3.6 oz / 100.9 g</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of using sucrose for the bottling sugar, I want to add 32 ounces of Just Tart Cherry juice.  With a total of four servings which lists 24 grams of sugars per serving.  That should total 96 grams.  Will the cherry juice successfully bottle condition this batch?</p>

"What is Responsible for the Dissipation of Krausen, and may a Batch be Bottled if its Krausen has Not been Dissipated?","<p>This picture contains two extract batches made on two successive days approximately two weeks ago. </p>

<p>One is a Honey Weizen (OG=1.048; Wyeast 1010 American Wheat Yeast), and the other is a Phat Tyre (OG=1.052; Wyeast 1762 Belgian Abbey I), both from Northern Brewer. </p>

<p>The instructions for both of these say to do 1-2 weeks in primary and 2-4 weeks in secondary. What I have usually done when I see this instruction is to leave it in primary for 4 weeks and then bottle.</p>

<p>The Honey Weizen still has a krausen. The Phat Tyre's krausen has dissipated. (To be honest it could possibly be the other way around, I forgot to put a post-it on each container ...

"Why Does a Heater in a Swamp Cooler Require a Pump to Distribute the Heated Liquid?","<p>I am facing my first winter of brewing with a <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9788/would-placing-the-fermenter-tank-in-a-tub-of-water-be-a-good-way-to-handle-hot-e"">swamp cooler</a>. I need to acquire a few aquarium heaters (incidentally, please let me know if you know a good brand) and drop them in my swamp cooler to maintain temperature.</p>

<p>Now almost everything I read online states that I also need to acquire a water pump to place underneath the water heater in order to ""distribute the hot water into the colder parts of the water"" ...</p>

<p>Why am I to believe that this is necessary? What force of nature could possibly prevent warm water from being evenly and automatically distributed over 5-7 gallons of water in a swamp cooler?</p>

<p>The general internet consensus is that only a few inches of water around the water heater will remain warm, that the warmth somehow stays in the same spot, that it doesn't distribute itself as physics as I understand it would require it.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the pump required -- what is the scientific explanation for how it is possible that warmth wouldn't flow from a hotter area to a colder area without the assistance from a pump, contrary to my understanding?</strong></p>

"My ""Cider"" has the consistency of puree - what to do?","<p>3 weeks ago, I set up a batch of apple to make hard cider. I chopped the apples in a kitchen machine and added yeast. The yeast I put into a smaller batch of the mashed apples before, after ading some sugar there was vissible fermentation (bubbles). For most of the three weeks, I guess the fermentation went ok - there were always visible bubbles in the water lock. For a few days to one week, there's hardly any bubbles forming, so I figured the fermentation is done. </p>

<p>When I tried racking the cider today, it was too thick and I could only get a small amount through the racking tube. It is more liquid when I set it up, but still very thick.  </p>

<p>The little bit I got through the tube, I filtered with a tea filter. The liquid is turbid, tastes slightly yeasty, sour and is definitly alcoholic.</p>

<p>Maybe an overreaction, but to kickstart the fermentation again I added a bit of sugar (maybe 2 tablespoons to 5kg apples) and shook the vessel to mix the stuff.</p>

<p>My father uses the same apples, he usually gets a clear liquid over a sediment of apples and yeast. He uses high performance yeast and adds lots of sugar to make booze.</p>

<p>The vessel ist standing in my kitchen with some temperature swings between day and night. The yeast I'm using is adopted to lower temperatures.</p>

"Why does my beer taste a little like wine?","<p>I'm a beginner homebrewer. I've brewed 3 beers, one from a Muntons and two from Brewferm brewkits. They were quite good, me and my friends liked them, but each one's taste reminded me a little bit of the taste of wine.</p>

<p>Why is that? Am I doing something wrong during brewing?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I used 2 Brewferm Gold and one Muntons Premium Bitter brewkits. I used the yeast which came with them. I added as much sugar as their manual said. The fermenter was a Brewferm plastic bucket put in a fridge with which temperature was controlled by a thermostat between 19 and 23°C. I fermented them for about 2 weeks, and they got the wine-like taste immediately before bottling them. The wine-like character is a bit sour, not strong. Definitely not sharp or vinegary. It tastes fine, like beer, but with a little wine-like character which doesn't fade much after 4 weeks in bottles at room temp.</p>

"Yeast/Green Apple Taste","<p>I have homebrewed with family many times and never had problems, nor did I with my first batch on my own.  The last couple, however, have had a yeasty/cidery/apple odor.  Very strong.  I doubt it is contamination; I am very careful about that.  I must have introduced some systematic error in my brewing.  The beers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Strong Ale something like an Arrogant Bastard.  I can post a link to the recipe on brewersfriend.com  if needed.  It hit the FG exactly, but smelled extremely strong.  4 weeks in primary, well temp controlled.  68 for first two weeks, 70 for second two, and due to a loss of power (apartment flooded) high 70's for the last two weeks.  I decided to bottle the stuff and age it anyway.  In hindsight I probably should have left it on the yeast?  After aging 3 weeks, the smell is not as strong and the taste is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Hazelnut Brown ale.  68 for first week, 70 for a few days, 72 for a few days.  All activity in blow-off stopped after 11 days, at 14 opened to see if ready for bottling, but it has a fair amount of yeast/apple/cider smell.  I threw the lid back on and have it aging in the mid 70's.  The FG is still a little high, but only be a few thousandths.  I assume this one is just not done?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other notes, I used starters for both and made sure to pitch a lot of yeast.  Wyeast 1056 for the first, and a mixture of White Labs English and European Ale yeast (WLP002 and WLP011 I think) for the latter.  The fermentation was extremely vigorous on the second day of each, to the point where I have to use a quick disconnect tube fitting to keep the blow-off tube on.  Blew tons of krausen and beer out the top.</p>

<p>Should I continue to age the two?  And what do you think is causing this so that I can avoid it?</p>

<p>Thanks!  Sorry for the wall-o-text.</p>

<p>Edit:  The smell has a slight cider smell to it, but it smells mostly like a fresh vial of liquid yeast.  But very, very strong in the AB clone.  Maybe a bit of apple.  My best idea is that I stressed the yeast and it did not finish the conversion of the acetylaldehyde into ethanol.  As far as sanitation, I have a second primary bucket, which I fill with water and iodine solution.  Usually I put in a bit more than is needed.  All utensils stay in that unless in use.  I apply the solution to the primary and the pot I use (I have to do extract for the next couple months until I move into a house).  I usually leave a bit on there.  I also have a squirt bottle I fill with the stuff to make sure things are sanitized.  Some items which are hard to get water into such as a bottling spicket, I will soak, then pout throught he dishwasher's sanitize cycle, then soak again.  I am  thinking from now on to use StarSan and sanitize all surfaces in my kitchen as well, including outside of all vessels.  I am brewing today and that is my plan so far. </p>

Then, the instructions call for moving the bottles back into cooler temperatures for lagering for an additional 2 weeks.

"Generic, fool-proof extract brewing method","<p>Ingredients have arrived - I'm ready to go ahead with my latest brew. All those which I have done thus far haven't been perfect for a variety of reasons (admittedly probably my own fault as I've tried different methods/techniques as I've been learning). </p>

<p>So I'm trying to establish a reliable extract brewing method, from boil-to-bottle, encompassing everything which I have done so far and what I've been advised/read on here and other sites.</p>

<p>This particular brew for which I will use this method is as follows:-</p>

<p>23L batch. 10L boil. Safale US-05 11.5g</p>

<p><em>Fermentables:-</em></p>

<p>5kg light liquid malt extract (0.25kg of which is late addition @ 15mins.)</p>

<p>100g Dextrose</p>

<p><em>Bittering:-</em></p>

<p>75g Apollo hops - 60min boil - 19% AA</p>

<p><em>Flavouring:-</em></p>

<p>25g Apollo hops - 30min boil - 19% AA</p>

<p>25g El Dorado hops - 30min boil - 14.1% AA</p>

<p><em>Aroma:-</em></p>

<p>75g El Dorado hops - 15min boil - 14.1% AA</p>

<p><em>Predicted Properties:-</em></p>

<p>Original Gravity: 1.063 Final Gravity: 1.012 ABV: 6.75% IBU: 103.99</p>

<p><strong><em>Method</em></strong></p>

<p>N.B. I'm omitting 'obvious' things like sterilisation here:-</p>

<p>1) Bring water to a rolling boil, remove from the heat and add required amount (add all if doing no late additions) of fermentables and stir until full dissolved. Ensure that none is stuck to the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>2) Return to a rolling boil and add the amount of hops as and when desired.</p>

<p>3) Flameout. Remove from heat and cool as fast as possible to near pitching temperature ASAP as to avoid bacterial growth etc.</p>

<p>4) Add additional water content to reach the desired fermentation volume. (As an addition/replacement for step 3, this water can be cooled as much as possible to aid in reducing the temperature of the wort.</p>

<p>5) Pitch yeast evenly when the wort is at a temperature slightly lower than ideal fermentation temperature. When fermentation commences, the yeasts' exothermic reactions will raise the temperature further until optimal temp. is reached.</p>

<p>6) Seal the FV and monitor fermentation. When complete, turn off heat source.</p>

<p>7) (A subjective step) Leave in primary for xx days (I usually go for 2-3 weeks in the primary, including the fermentation period.)</p>

<p>8) Once conditioned, cold crash the FV in a bath or suitable container for approx. 48 hours prior to bottling to aid in yeast drop out.</p>

<p>9) Prime bottles, add beer, cap, store in warm place for minimum 2 weeks to condition and carbonate.</p>

<p>10) Drink.</p>

"First time brewer. I'm afraid I've ruined my beer","<p>This is my first time breing beer, and I was doing so while distracted with kids, and unfortunately I missed the dry malt extract packet that was in my IPA kit.  There were 2 cans of a liquid malt extract, and when the directions said to add the malt extract I thought that was all there was, and while I was cleaning up this evening I found the packet of dry extract.  Do y'all think the beer will be ruined? Should I just toss it out and chalk it up as a learning experience?  Or just roll with it and hopefully it turns out ok?</p>

"Is it Better to leave beer in secondary longer or bottle?","<p>first question asked in homebrew.stackexchange.</p>

<p>I've got a pumpkin ale that I've just moved from primary to secondary (after 7 weeks). The original plan was to have it 7/7/7 (7 weeks in primary, 7 weeks in secondary and then 7 weeks in bottle) before opening. </p>

<p>Why? because I liked the sound of it</p>

<p>However, there's a local home-brewer's competition that I'd like to enter, and the submissions close in 4 weeks time. So the question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I leave it in secondary for another week and then bottle for 3?</li>
<li>Do I leave it in secondary for another 2 and bottle for 2?</li>
<li>Do I leave it for another 3 weeks and then bottle for only 1?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that there are different types of fermentation stages and it has to go through each of those stages after I add my bottling sugars, but to be honest, I don't <em>QUITE</em> comprehend those stages (yet).</p>

<p>I was just wondering which of the 3 above options would probably be the best.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>As an added bonus, would I need to pitch more yeast?</p>

<p>Extra info: I've got about 45 litres of the stuff, so I'll be drawing about 5 for the competition and leaving the rest for the 7/7/7 plan</p>

"How would I handle a boil-over and loss of hops?","<p>I recently was brewing a 1 gallon kit from Northern Brewer (The White House Honey Ale kit) and instantly after adding the first packet of hops, the entire kettle boiled over. Absolutely instantly, there's nothing I could do to stop it. </p>

"How to fix yeast smell in young wine from kit","<p>I started my first attempt at fermenting <a href=""http://www.morebeer.com/products/rjs-craft-winemaking-grand-cru-international-australian-cabernet-sauvignon.html?site_id=9"" rel=""nofollow"">this wine kit</a> in mid-April.</p>

<p>I followed the initial directions pretty meticulously which included stirring in the fermentation bucket daily (due to kit including dried grape skins).</p>

<p>My hydrometer was reading a bit higher than reality, so the racking at ~1.020 might've been a bit behind. Almost for sure the racking at 0.998 was a late. At that point I stabilized according to instructions, racked it back into a 6 gallon carboy, and topped it up.</p>

<p>The problem is when testing for clarity (which now seems fine) it has a very strong yeast smell, and somewhat strong yeast flavor.</p>

<p>I know a young wine shouldn't taste ""ready"" yet, and I'd be happy to bottle and age if that's normal, but from most things I've read so far this isn't quite normal. (I'm not going for the ""on lees"" flavor since this is a Cabernet Sauvignon.)</p>

"Clarity for the sake of impatience","<p>I've been in the winemaking industry for over a decade, but this is only my second homebrew, and only the first that I have fermented at home. You would think I'd be more patient working with a product that takes two years for completion, but alas...here we are.</p>

<p>Primary fermentation was slooow. I split the batch with a friend and he was done in a week. Mine was a touch colder and ran closer to two. After the gravity stopped moving, I shoved the carboy into a fridge in an attempt to cold crash. The only change was I removed the airlock and sealed the typical orange cap. After about nine days, and no crystal clear clarity, I talked to a buddy who used to do this semi-pro and he recommended moving to a secondary and putting the airlock back on. So I did that, and in the process of racking I noticed the the residual carbon dioxide was fairly present. Winemaker me thinks that is the main culprit in keeping small amounts of lees in suspension.</p>

<p>So now it's been three to four days later, and I'm seeing no appreciable gains. Is it just a waiting game?
If I keg it, will it eventually settle despite the increase in C02?
Should I clarify if it's that important to me?</p>

<p>If it will eventually clear in keg, that would be doable as I get to ""check on its progress"" when needed.</p>

<p>I like the idea of clarifying, but not if it strips the beer. I'm leaning toward Polyclar or maybe gelatin.</p>

"on not priming ale","<p>After reading Graham Wheeler's Brew your own British ale, in which he says:"" a well brewed beer, kept its proper time, should not need priming or fining. A good yeast will clear down unaided, and residual dextrins in the beer will  slowly ferment and produce perfect condition......""
I have tried this on a a couple of bottles of dry Irish stout which did come into condition after 10 weeks at lowish temps (5-14 degrees centigrade), though the carbonation/head was pretty weak compared with the (normally) primed others. I have tried the same with my ESB which has been bottled now for 8 weeks at the balmy English summer temps of 12-16 degrees centigrade. Bottles have started to condition now but head still weak..... Taste brilliant. (but more so than the bottles that were primed normally? I can't compare them cos I quaffed the whole primed lot and thus have nothing to compare the un-primed bottles with).
Just wondered if anybody else had experience of not priming?</p>

"What is the approximate batch size/OG limit for US-05 11g packet? Have I used enough?","<p>I've started a brew with an OG of 1.065 in a 23L batch.

<p>So, I upped the temperature of my fermenter having realised I only set it at 17degC (oops, I meant to do 19degC but I'm hoping it won't be too much of a problem - it's a versatile yeast I hear!) as well as doing a pretty vigorous swirl of the fermenter to kick up some of the yeast cake. Came back a few hours later, hoorah, bubbles! I'm aware that bubble rate is a terrible way of judging fermentation stage (atmospheric temperature and pressure being factors but both have been consistent over the past week) but going from no bubbles to bubbles after doing this can only be a good thing!</p>

<p>I was/am a bit worried that I didn't pitch enough yeast for this OG since the Brewers' Friend yeast pitch calculator said I was short by about half the cells required - maybe I'm just being paranoid?!</p>

"Is my gummy wild yeast unusual?","<p>As an experiment, I brewed a gallon-sized batch last weekend using some wild yeast I had captured. Fermentation looks to have proceeded pretty normally, except that the yeast has a somewhat strange appearance. In particular, it seems to be very gummy. Big chunks of it keep traveling in both directions -- from the sediment at the bottom to the kräusen at the top, and vice versa -- and it's starting to stick to pretty much every part of the glass fermenter.</p>

<p>Is this unusual? Is it a sign of lactobacillus or some other non-yeast activity?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The history behind the yeast: last summer, I used unwashed organic grapes with white flour and water to create a bread starter. I've been keeping the starter alive since then; at first, by feeding it every day, three times a day. More recently, it spends six days out of seven in the refrigerator and gets three feedings on its day out. The starter has a rather floral bouquet and does not taste very sour at all.</p>

<p>I took about two tablespoons of this starter and put it into a DME soup. As I was able to observe the expected yeast activity, I concluded that my ""bread yeast"" was capable of doing duty as ""brewers yeast"". When I pitched, I avoided including the original blobs of dough -- though of course, some flour is likely to have dissolved into the larger quantity of liquid.</p>

I took another peek today (14 days in) just to make sure I'm not about to bottle a mess, and I just wanted some confirmation that what I'm seeing is ok (and not symptoms of mold or contamination), considering the difference between last pic and this pic. </p>

<p>Here's ~7 days into it: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgoodwin/6932711321/in/set-72157629461259769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgoodwin/6932711321/in/set-72157629461259769</a></p>

<p>Here's today: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgoodwin/6949595183/in/photostream"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgoodwin/6949595183/in/photostream</a></p>

<p>There was some temperature fluctation, but I've tried to keep it no higher than 72. In the past couple of days I got it down towards 69...maybe it's some renewed fermentation?</p>

<p>When I pull the lid on the pail, I definitely get the ""whoosh""/hiss sound of CO2 coming out. </p>

<p>Thanks for your advice!!</p>

<p>Update:
Bottling is done! </p>

<p>FG is right at 1.011, with the acceptable range being 1.010-1.012. </p>

<p>When I opened the primary this time, there was no ""whoosh"" or feel of air escaping. Also it seems all the big bubbles were gone and down into a ton of tiny bubbles. They dissipated quickly while racking to the bottling bucket. That makes me pretty hopeful it's not a solid (like a mold or yeasts still stuck together etc.).</p>

<p>Samples smell like a perfect ale. Taste tested by 3 people, all found it tasty, if not particularly ""complex"". I know the carbonation/conditioning process can change the flavor characteristics...</p>

<p>Got 21 22oz bottles full, and about 5 normal size to be ""flavor/carb check"" victims. About 1/2 gallon left in the bottling bucket when we stopped; it just had too many solids and I didn't have a proper screen or way to filter them. It's definitely starting to become clear the advantage of a secondary to help refine/filter, or at least trying to filter while going to bottling bucket. </p>

<p>Whatcha think guys?</p>

"Keg/CO2 question as I think about moving to kegging","<p>This is probably a foolish one, but...</p>

<p>So you can force carbonate with a keg (or sugar carbonate, but of course why would you), and then serve from the keg with the CO2 to help dispense. </p>

<p>But, if one wanted to get a couple of kegs but only a single CO2 tank, is that a normal manageable setup? </p>

<p>I would conjecture that the procedure is: ferment (in primary), carbonate in keg (either priming or force), dispense (for keg 1). Then is it acceptable practice to repeat into keg 2 (3, et al) by removing the tank from keg 1 and using it on 2, and 3, and then simply moving the tank back to whichever one you want to dispense from when you are ready? </p>

<p>I.e. does there need to be a constant tank hookup (I would think no, the keg itself is air and pressure tight?), or can you make the most of your investment by cycling through a tank or two to pull off beer from multiple kegs as desired? </p>

<p>Edit: Clarified that I meant ferment in the primary, NOT in the keg!</p>

"Corny Real Ale?","<p>I am interested in learning some of the intricacies associated with 'real ale'. I realize that out in industry, this is done in large stainless steel (or aluminum?) barrels with special corks etc etc in order to achieve the desired level of carbonation and aging. My question is, has it been attempted to replicate this keg conditioning using a corny keg, aside from simply adding priming sugar and letting it carb? Would a first attempt at this be as simple as hooking up a pressure relief of some sort to the CO2-in port, and letting it sit at 58F (ish) for awhile, or is the cask conditioning process much more involved than this? </p>

"Does mash thickness make a difference in any calculations?","<p>I am looking to do my first partial mash and I have been seeing instructions for using a mash thickness anywhere from 1 to 1.5 quarts of water per pound (per 450g).  What does the thickness of a mash change?  Are there any calcuations that need to be adjusted based on this thickness?</p>

<p>Also, does changing the ratio of the sparge water to pounds of grain change anything?</p>

<p>I typically do a 5 gallon (19 litre)  batch and a 3 gallon (11 litre) boil (do not have the equipment for a full boil yet).  What is a typical ratio.  I have read that a thicker mash will provide a fuller body and sweeter taste.  However the tradeoff I've seen is that the sugars may not ferment fully, is that accurate?</p>

"What is the average gravity difference between a Forced Fermentation and normal fermentation","<p>I just started doing forced fermentation (FF) tests with each batch I make.

Is there a normal range, or is it going to vary wildly?</p>

<p>For example, I just finished a batch of ESB. The FF beer has an FG of 1.013 and the beer in the carboy stopped at 1.016 - 1.017. Is that a normal range, or is that an indication that the beer in the carboy didn't ferment fully? </p>

"Boiling bottle caps","<p>I've always soaked my bottle caps in sanitizer before using, but a friend of mine suggested boiling (throw in the same pot with priming sugar) instead because the cooties can theoretically hide from the sanitizer solution but not from the heat.

"Do you use a default/standard base malt? What are the advantages?","<p>Does anyone use a standard base malt to build your recipes from? What are the advantages?</p>

<p>A couple of obvious advantages would be having the ability to buy large bags of the base malt (and ensuring that it's still fresh when you use it) and having a consistent base to build from.</p>

<p>I've always built my recipes using different base malts for flavor. For example, if I want a malty British style beer, I tend to use Maris Otter as my base. If I brew a Belgian beer, I use a Belgian pale or pils as the base. Etc.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about trying to convert all of my recipes to use a readily-available pale malt (e.g. Briess), but trying to match the flavor profiles provided by the other base malts has prevented me from doing so thus far.</p>

  <p>Yeasts are facultative anaerobes meaning that they can exist in both the presence and absence of oxygen. While fermentation is traditionally thought of as an anaerobic process done in the absence of oxygen, early exposure of the yeast to oxygen can be a vital component in the successful completion of that fermentation. This is because oxygen is important in the synthesis of cell ""survival factors"".</p>

"Beer Bottle vs. Can Head Space, Carbonation, and Conditioning","<p>I have brewed at least a couple hundred 5-gallon batches of ale over the last 20+ years. For the vast majority of these batches, I have kegged in corny kegs and force carbonated using 30 PSI and shaking for a few minutes, or more often in the last 10 years, by setting the regulator at ~12 PSI for a week.</p>

<p>For the last 3-4 years, I have been bottling more batches for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is easier to send home with friends.</li>
<li>I can have more variety (not restricted to the two kegs that fit in the beer fridge). I served 7 different styles in bottles at last year's New Years Day open house.</li>
<li>I can vary the carbonation of each batch more easily (to match properly match the style). This is an issue when I serve from kegs because I have one regulator and therefore one pressure setting for my two kegs.</li>
<li>I don't have to run down to the basement (where the beer fridge lives) every time I want another beer; instead, I can have a few bottles in the kitchen fridge.</li>
</ol>

<p>When bottling, I use 22-ounce bomber bottles. I prime a 5 gallon batch with, usually, 3.0-3.5 ounces (depending on style) of dextrose (boiled in a small volume of water, well-mixed with the beer in the bottling bucket). I fill the bottles with a half-inch diameter, spring-tipped bottling wand, such as <a href=""https://www.northernbrewer.com/collections/bottle-filling/products/1-2-bottle-filler-15-length"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>. I fill the bottle until it is completely full or overflows just a little. When the filler is withdrawn, it leaves the perfect amount of head space in the bottle. In other words, the volume of the bottling wand up to the height of the bottle is a good match for the desired head space. I let the bottles carbonate for at least 7-10 days at room temperature.</p>

<p>I recently acquired a <a href=""https://oktoberdesign.com/shop/can-seamers/sl1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can seamer</a> and 16-ounce cans (type 211 with 202 lids).</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I adjust the amount of priming sugar for 16-ounce cans vs. what works for me with 22-ounce bottles in order to achieve the same level of carbonation in the glass?</li>
<li>Should I adjust how I decide that the package is full when filling a can? In other words, does the cross-section of the filling wand times the height of a 16-ounce can create the right head space volume in the can?</li>

"Does cold crashing have a negative impact?","<p>According to ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer (4th ed.), cold conditioning (a.k.a. lagering) is the act of cooling beer after fermentation has completed (including maturation) in order to clarify the beer. So far so good.</p>

<p>The book also suggests to slowly decrease the temperature (down to 1 °C/day!) to avoid thermal shock on the yeast:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point of slow cooling is to prevent thermal shock of the yeast and subsequent excretion of fatty acids and other lipids. These lipids can interfere with head retention and will readily oxidize, creating stale flavors. Thermal shock at any time can cause the yeast cells to release protein signals that cause other yeast cells to shut down to protect against the cold, potentially leading to premature flocculation and underattenuation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, everyone seems to cold crash, and I did not find other sources supporting this claim. Is there any evidence? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I am also not sure whether this would also be relevant for pitching temperature since, for instance, the rehydration temperature for dry yeast is usually higher than fermentation temperature.</p>

<p>... last but not least, such method definitely makes the overall process 1-2 weeks longer, which is pretty annoying.</p>

<p>Is something throwing the refractometer off? I haven't had this issue before.</p>

<p>Maybe I under-pitched? But half a packet of yeast for a one gallon should be plenty, right?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"How is alcohol-free beer manufactured? Can one make it at home?","<p>I have recently found that some alcohol free beers such as German hefeweissbiers like Weihenstephaner Hefeweisbier Alkoholfrei, and BrewDog Nanny State taste pretty ok, actually. I have also found that some other alcohol free beers are heavily unbalanced and are practically undrinkable.</p>

<p>About the only drawback of these alcohol-free beers is that they cost quite a lot; the cost with taxes is the same as the cost of beer with 5% ABV, and the taxes where I live are high for alcoholic drinks!</p>

<p>How are the good tasting alcohol free beers manufactured? Is the alcohol in the beer somehow removed in an industrial process, or do they just use less malt so that the alcohol concentration remains below 0.5%?</p>

<p>Can one reasonably make alcohol-free beer that tastes good at home? Where I live, distilling high-alcohol-content drinks is illegal, and if the process to make an alcohol-free beer is to just distill the alcohol away, it might be pretty risky to own the equipment for that... (Well, ok, if the purpose is to just get rid of the alcohol, you don't need all of the distilling equipment, simply boiling it at a controlled temperature would work.)</p>

"Wine blending from different years","<p>As a home winemaker, I try to focus on <strong>one</strong> varietal per year.  This allows me to do the harvest, crush, press and all associated cleaning only <strong>ONCE</strong> per year in the fall.  But it does limit my blending abilities only getting one varietal.</p>

<p>I currently have ~50gal of 2018 Merlot, and am considering either (a) bottling it as is soon or (b) getting ~50gal of Cab this fall and blending it all 50/50 next summer ... 🤔</p>

<p>I found this <a href=""https://winemakermag.com/article/97-blending-to-improve-wines"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a> by Ed Kraus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blend wines that are from the same year. Blending wines from different years, in general, does not work as well. Wines blended from different years seem to have more instances of precipitation. These types of blends also seem to pull the older vintage back to a youthful harshness even though it might have been almost at its ultimate age for consumption.</p>

"Pasteurizing Apple Juice for Cider","<p>I'm an experienced Beer home brewer, but I've never done a Cider and would like to try. I've bought natural pressed apple juice from a farm near me, it's free of preservatives, and thus is chilled to be drunk soon. It's reasonably sweet (not tart) and may already have sugar added for sweetness. It's very clear clean apple juice and awesome to drink.</p>

"Is phenol production temperature related or not?","<p>It is well known that ester formation in beer is mainly a factor of temperature. Higher fermentation temperatures produce more esters. (Other factors play a role as well, such as the yeast's genetic proclivity to ester formation, pitching rates and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, but if these are considered equal, temperature is the primary controlling factor.)</p>

<p>Lately I have been brewing some Belgian ales with POF+ Belgian yeasts, which causes me to wonder: <strong>is the formation of spicy phenols also temperature-related?</strong></p>

<p>(Once again other factors in POF formation play a role here, the most well-known one being the presence of ferulic acid in Weizen worts, which is decarboxylated into  4-Vinyl guaiacol during fermentation. However, this phenol is only a minor one among the desirable volatile spicy phenols typically produced by Belgian yeasts.)</p>

<p>I understand that phenols are produced early in the fermentation cycle, whereas esters are produced later from fatty acids and higher alcohols. However, Belgian fermentations typically start cool in order to keep the higher alcohols in check and prevent a ""hot"" or harsh alcohol character, and are then ramped up. Pitching warm and starting the fermentation warm can create an excess of sharp and ""hot"" fusels but I haven't noticed an increase in spicy phenols in these cases. Which suggests that the formation of these spicy notes in POV+ yeasts is not significantly temperature related.</p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<p>If so, what factors govern the amount of volatile spicy phenols in Belgian ales and how might they be manipulated to vary the amounts of volatile spicy phenols produced?</p>

"Clean kegged, put back together wrong","<p>I recently brewed my second batch of 2x 5 gallon beers. The first time, kegs were recently reconditioned and so I did a quick clean and filled them up.

First batch went smoothly, and is all gassed up and tasting delicious. The second batch is now an issue.</p>

<p>I kegged it about 2+ weeks ago, and connected the gas line around 13-14 psi. I went in this weekend to taste test, and make sure all was well. It wasn't. </p>

<p>The problem seems to be, from lack of knowledge, that I flipped the posts when putting it all back together. I wasn't able to get the picnic black beer quick connect to go onto the post. I tussled and thought, then noticed that the out post looked taller than the in post.   Acting smart I unscrewed the faucet adapter from the quick connect, and swapped it with the gas in quick connect (after taking them apart and assuming the are nearly identical.  That seems to all fit better, although the colors are 'backwards'.</p>

<p>However, now the beer seems carbonated, but is coming out at a rate not befitting of beer, something more like a pint in minute. </p>

Are the posts different only in height?
Are the quick connects different only in that same manner?

"What does a good crush look like, and does it matter if grains are overcrushed if batch sparging?","<p>I am looking for some advice on what a good crush looks like, and whether it matters on my system. The opinions and pics online are all over the place on this.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: I am buying small-batch all-grain kits at my LHBS, and the grains come pre-crushed. I am pretty new to all-grain. I batch sparge in a two-gallon cooler, using a paint strainer bag instead of a false bottom or bazooka screen. The crushed grains have mostly whole husks separated from the kernel, what seems like a lot of flour, and about an 80-20 mix of broken kernels to whole kernels.</p>

<p><em>Does the crush, especially having a high flour ratio) make a difference if I am batch sparging?</em>  I don't have to worry about stuck sparges, but my wort is very cloudy.  My finished beer is hazy.</p>

<p>I am getting absorbtion of around 0.25 gal./lb., which is around double <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/6494/importance-of-mash-and-sparge-water-volumes-using-batch-sparge/6496#6496"">the 0.13 gal./lb. rate I saw on this forum</a>. (I calculate absorbtion as: [water into mash tun] - [volume of two runnings into boil kettle].  My mash tun has negligible dead space, and I run everything out on the second runnings.) <em>Could the crush explain my higher-than-predicted absorbtion rate?</em></p>

<p>If it matters in answering my question, my efficiency into the fermenter is around 62-63% on my system using this crushed grain, I don't test pH or my water, I use bottled water, my strike water to grain ratio is 1.5 qts/lb., and I then add my sparge water based on how much more wort I need by measuring first runnings.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Correction, I misread my notes on what I am collecting.  My absorbtion loss is a hair over one quart per <em>two</em> lbs. of grain, so that is squarely in the .125 gal./lb. that the experts tell us to expect.</p>

The friendly man behind the counter helped me to re-create this kit by checking their files for what came in this kit. This is what I got:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Beermakers"" lager extract kit 1.7kg tin</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.liquorcraft.com.au/afawcs0133827/CATID=0/SUBID=246/ID=197/SID=105027792/productdetails.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""Beer kit converter"" pack</a> for making lagers, consisting of a 1kg bag of powder (a mix of maltose, dextrose, maltodextrin, malted barley) and a 10g packet of Golden Cluster hop pellets</li>
<li>SAFLAGER S-23 yeast 11.5g packet, refrigerated</li>
<li>25g packet of Citra hop pellets for dry-hopping</li>
<li>500g of pure honey (of which I only used 250g)</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is, because I didn't buy the kit as a whole, I didn't get the specific instructions for this recipe kit. Instead I had multiple sets of instructions (the ""beer kit converter"" pack came with some instructions, the tin of extract had instructions on it, and the yeast also had some guidelines as to temperatures etc, and lastly I had a look at some extract kit recipes online that use honey to figure out at what point to add the honey). This is what I ended up doing:</p>

<p>Heated 3L of water in 7L pot on gas stove. Dissolved 1 kg ""Beer kit converter"" powder, followed by 250ml honey and 2 tsp cinnamon powder for a hint of spice. Brought to boiling point as per instructions that came with ""beer kit converter"", added 10g Golden Cluster hop pellets and boiled for 2-3 minutes. Left pot for 15 minutes in kitchen sink in cold water to bring temperature down a bit.</p>

<p>Heated up can of Beermakers lager extract, emptied into fermenter. Rinsed can with boiled water. Added wort from pot to fermenter, stirred vigorously. Added can of hot water with remaining extract and stirred vigorously. Topped up with room temperature water to 21L mark, and stirred thoroughly. Pitched 11.5g of Saflager S-23 yeast at 24-26 degrees C. The OG reading was 1046. </p>

<p>Here's my problem: I've struggled to keep the temperature consistently low (the yeast pack recommended 12-15 degreees C but I've had it fluctuating between 18 and 22 degrees C). The packet did specify that you can pitch and ferment at room temperature when using a single packet, or at the cooler temperature when using two packets. It started bubbling away nicely fairly soon, but within 24 hours it started to emit a ""rotten eggs"" smell which I believe is sulphur hydroxide or something. It wasn't very bad at first, and I read on reddit homebrewing that this is often a normal by-product of fermentation, but it's been more than 72 hours since I pitched the yeast and it is still producing a LOT of stinky gas. So much so that I've moved it to my garage as it was getting pretty bad! This is also not good for keeping temperature consistent (early summer in Melbourne, Australia - not too hot yet but will get hot soon). I've also noticed that there's a very small layer of foam/krausen on top, no more than 1-1.5cm. My previous extract brew produced a few inches of froth/krausen. </p>

<p>So, is the rotten eggs smell something to worry about? And can someone tell me, am I brewing a lager (hence should I properly lager this brew at low temperatures for a long time) or am I brewing a lager-style ale which can ferment and condition at more mild temperatures (18 - 22 degrees C)?</p>

<p>My first brew, a dark ale, tasted really good but didn't have much of a head. I'll explain how I brewed it - perhaps someone can explain if I did anything wrong?</p>

<ol>
<li>Boiled up the extract (2 standard tins) with about 80g of hops in as much water as I could get on my stove top.</li>
<li>Put the extract in my 5 gallon primary fermenter (not a pressure barrel) and topped up to 5 gallons with boiled water.</li>
<li>Added a 20g hop bag into the primary fermenter</li>
<li>Added yeast when the brew was about room temperature</li>
<li>about 36 hours later primary fermentation started... bubbling away nicely after 48 hours. I'm in the UK so I needed to wrap the barrel in blankets - I kept the temperature at around 20oC fairly well.</li>
<li>When fermentation had pretty much finished I siphoned off into a sterilised 5 gallon pressure barrel (no CO2 cannister. Made sure it was quite splashy when I did it. I primed it with about a cupful of sugar and lidded up the barrel.</li>
<li>After another couple of days I was tapping off nice pints of dark ale under reasonable pressure (at least I thought it was reasonable pressure - it might not have been) but with no head. I'd only tap a max of 4 pints a day for my wife and me... perhaps 6 tops.</li>
<li>After another 2 or 3 days I was beginning to get at least a thin layer of small bubbles sitting on top of the pint but nothing approaching a head, as such.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, with my second brew (a light malt/wheat hoppy brew) on the go in my primary 5 gallon bucket (with air trap - not pressurised) I want to try and get a better head. I got the brew going yesterday and by this morning it was bubbling vigorously. I've added extra sugar so it's going to be about a 6.5% brew and I want to put it in my pressure barrel. How and when would I be best to do this, and is there anything else I can do to improve the head?</p>

"Mr Beer Fermentor Leaking","<p>Found an old Mr Beer kit that had never been used. The malt and yeast that came with the kit had expired, so I bought replacements. I followed the directions in the booklet, and put the fermenter in a cabinet. </p>

<p>When I checked a few hours later, a small amount of liquid, maybe half an ounce, was coating the bottom of my cabinet. I put the fermenter on a rimmed cookie sheet, and it is still leaking very slowly, less than an ounce a day. </p>

<p>Should I just toss it? Wait until bottling and see if it's bad? Should I try to fix it somehow? The leak is very slow, so it's hard to tell where it's coming from, and I don't want to mess with it too much. </p>

"Formulating a recipe","<p>Can anyone guess at how to build a clone recipe? Its for Duclaws <a href=""http://duclaw.com/beer/sweet-baby-jesus/#sthash.ypwRgVp1.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">Sweet Baby Jesus</a>, a friend requested a clone. Their website only says it's a Black beer, a Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter. Their website only lists the types of grains and hops, but not the amounts. I'm guessing there would be various adjuncts, probably both in the boil and ""dry hopping"" with the coffee (I've done dry coffee grounds before). I'm not sure where the peanut butter flavor would come from though. I can probably guess at the hops, but the grains is where I'd need help, and the peanut butter, that is a mystery to me.</p>

<p>From the website</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...jet black in color with a tan, rocky head, full body and creamy,
  luxurious mouthfeel. Its lightly sweet, malty flavor is accented by
  rich flavors of chocolate, coffee and peanut butter, and balanced by a
  subtle hop character and moderate 6.5% abv. Sweet Baby Jesus finishes
  smooth, dry, and roasty with lingering notes of chocolate and peanut
  butter...</p>

"Dry Hopping Question","<p>I am super new to brewing but extremely ambitious. I just have a dry hop question so I hope you see this. So I'm currently fermenting a double IPA with Columbus for bittering and Cascade for aroma. Well i'm a huge fan of citrus in my IPAs and I want to dry hop with 2 oz Citra and 2 oz Cascade to bring up my hop aroma. The question is, I am waiting until i rack to secondary, but I want to just drop the pellets into the carboy without a bag since its a narrow neck glass 5 gal. When would you recommend throwing the hops in since i wont be able to extract them. I am going to filter on my racking cane when i siphon into bottling bucket. Can I just toss them in, and rack on top of them from the primary? Should I wait until the last week in the secondary? Should I rack into secondary, pitch the hops in and seal it up for the entire 14 days? Hope someone can help!</p>

"Must won't ferment, too sour?","<p>I prepared a must for a mead last weekend (recipe below) and after a whole week there has been no fermentation activity. I took a pH reading and it came in at <strong>4.4</strong> - is it likely that the must is simply too acidic for the yeast? I added a teaspoon of CaCO3 and stirred it in - got a small fizz - so will wait and see if that works. Should I re-pitch more yeast?</p>

<p>16L mineral water
4kg cherry blossom honey
4kg peeled, stoned, and pasteurised lychees
11g US-05</p>

<p>I pitched the yeast at 20 degrees, after aerating the cooled must. There's 20L of must in 2x10L fermentors. I added 1tsp of yeast nutrient in each fermentor, along with 1tsp of pectic enzyme and 1tsp of tartaric acid. When fermentation hadn't started after 2 days I prepared a yeast starter with another 11g of US-05 and the starter was fine, so I know the yeast was healthy when I pitched.</p>

"Minimal neccesary time in primary/seconday for a barleywine-braggot","<p>I am still rather beginner (so far a couple of batches), but for the last batch I have taken a brave (irresponsible) step and went for a barley wine-braggot beer. For batch of 22 l In have used +- 6 kg of pale extract, 1 kg of specialty grains (crystal + a bit of chocolate malt) and after 3 days added 2 kg of pasteurized honey into the primary. Fermented with Magrove's Jack Newcastle yeast, keeping it at 19-20 degrees.
rack it into secondary for another month and then bottle - but it was based partly on reading, partly on guess. As I am reading into it, I am staring to hesitate. The thing is, I have only a plastic secondary (a large thin-walled plastic bottle you can buy water in for a water cooler) and I am not sure, is it better to rack into thin plastic secondary, or go for bottle conditioning? 
Also, how long is usually necessary in secondary? I know the longer the better, but when can I more or less expect for the edges to smooth a bit?</p>

Needless to say the carpets ruined in there with a gallon or so of wort and hops spread on my carpet, clothes, and walls.</p>

However, for the last few weeks I have been using my hydrometer and noticing that 1.100 now corresponds to closer to 12.5% ABV. I have checked my old books and yes conversion tables ARE what I thought they were, but looking at conversion tables on the internet today show that 1.100 is between 12.3 and 12.7% ABV. What used to be universal appear to not be accurate and what is generally considered universal today doesn't match the past.</p>

"Corn Sugar Off Flavors","<p>I know there is a substantial amount of debate regarding whether to use DME or corn sugar or table sugar to bottle prime, but I wanted to ask the question if priming with simple glucose, can perceivable off-flavors be introduced?</p>

<p>I tasted a bit of an IPA I made prior to priming, and i was a clean, neutral, hop-forward with some malt flavor.  Then I bottle-primed and noticed something very similar to other beers I have made.  Its almost a cidery/green apple flavor that other people can't necessarily notice but is unmistakeable to me, and was NOT present prior to me bottling.  </p>

<p>The only other possibility is, I will often (and did in this case), add my dissolved sugar syrup to the bottlin bucket AFTER I rack the entire batch to my bottling bucket.  I pour the sugar solution VERY slowly down the side of the bottling bucket to minimize oxidation (but maybe still get some?).  I do this because all of my fermenters/secondaries aren't marked for volume, and I want to be precise in calculating the weight of the priming sugar.  I know that oxidation typically tastes like cardboard though, and not acetaldehyde.  </p>

<p>The firkin specialist at a local brewery told me to NEVER prime with corn sugar, and always prime with DME.  He says the former ""just gives it that homebrew flavor"".  However, I've heard that DME can be incredibly imprecise when used for priming.  </p>

"Bottle carbonation - too much priming sugar?","<p>I posted a <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/5936/combating-diacetyl"">question</a> here before about what I decided was an 'extract twang' flavor. I tried a bottle from batch #2 yesterday, and I noticed the same thing. Here's where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>My brew has only been in the bottle about at week so far, and the situation was the same last time I noticed this, so I'm beginning to think that the flavor is potentially from unconsumed priming sugar. Could that be? Also, I found the carbonation level to be just fine, and I'm worried about over-carbonation if there is still priming sugar left. </p>

<p>I had the same fear for my <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/5955/variable-carbonation"">last batch</a> and decided to refrigerate it in order to stop the yeast from carbonating further. This ended up causing around a third of the bottles to be under-carbonated.</p>

I have a recipe that says to boil three gallons of the water in a five gallon pot (to create the wort). And then later to add in the remaining water. I bought an eight gallon pot.

"How fast should I run water through my wort chiller?","<p>My father-in-law got me a wort chiller for my birthday, one of those copper coil immersion jobs and I'm now putting it to the test.  This is only my second batch of beer, so I'm pretty new at this.</p>

<p>How fast should I be putting water through the chiller?  I've seen elsewhere that folks note that they're done chilling the wort when the water coming out the hose is cool, but mine was never hot.  Should I run the water quickly to put as much through as possible, or slow it down so the water actually has a chance to get hot before coming out the other end?  I'd sorta like to err on the side of using less water since I don't have a good way to capture it and reuse it at the moment, but that's not a huge concern.</p>

"Chilling wort before pitching yeast","<p>I know it is important to chill wort to &lt;80 before pitching yeast, and that quality of final beer is affected by the speed with which the wort was chilled to this point, and there are various methods of doing this, wort chillers, ice baths etc. The instructions on the extract kit (NB) say when it is cooled, transfer to a container containing 2 gallons of cold water.</p>

<p>My question is, why not keep 2 gallons of water chilled in the fridge, and add this directly to the wort immediately after the boil?  this will cool the wort to pitching temperature immediately, which will surely reduce the risk of issues!?  I use gallon jugs of spring water so there should not be any contaminants in the water.</p>

<p>is there a good reason why i should NOT do this?  i used this method for my last batch and do not detect any issues, but as its so easy i am surprized i have not come across this as a recomended technique (and negate the need for buying a chiller).</p>

"Priming calculation after cold crashing for a week","<p>So beer temperature affects residual co2 in beer for priming, the lower the temp the more residual.
I've got a Ryepa that I plan on carbing to 2.4 vols of CO2. Its been in a 55 degree closet for 4-5 days, should I use temperature compensation
for that current temp of 55 or the 63 degrees it was at before crashing?</p>

<p>For a 5 gallon batch the higher temp actually only adds around .3 ounces of cane sugar....guessing that won't make much of a difference.</p>

<p>I guess a side note, which calculator do you guys find to be more accurate....HBD or NB's calc?
Usually there's not much more than a fraction of an ounce difference with HDB being higher.</p>

"Is iodophor ideal for rinse-less sanitization before bottling?","<p>I was talking to a friend today and complainIng about the clean/bleach/sanitize/rinse process I undergo when bottling. He dug a bottle of iodophor out of a back shelf and asked me to try it out. He said it was sitting there for years and has never used it. This I assumed would be better than rinsing as a final step to avoid re-contaminating my equipment. Not to mention making my cleaning process faster.</p>

<p>The directions say to let drip-dry. So my question is this: For the time it takes for this cold-water iodophor solution to dry is there greater risk of contamination versus rinsing and racking? Also, is there a lifespan to iodophore? I know it breaks down quickly when in solution and exposed to air and there is no exp date on the bottle. </p>

"Sanitization practices when dry hopping in a muslin bag","<p>I've had good results, have always done it the same way in recent years, but always question myself when I dry hop.</p>

<ul>
<li>Weigh-out my pellet hops</li>
<li>Scrub my hands with soap an water</li>
<li>Drop a weight, a muslin bag and a length of dental floss into my pitcher of StarSan</li>
<li>Put my hands into the pitcher for a minute, then pick up the bag</li>
<li>Squeeze (hard) on the muslin bag to rid it of most of the StarSan</li>
<li>Open the damp bag, drop in the weight and hops</li>
<li>Tie the top of the bag closed with the dental floss</li>
<li>Pull the plug out of the carboy, drop the bag in (leaving the tail of the dental floss out, so I can retrieve the bag later)</li>
<li>Put the plug back in the carboy</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course I do this when most of the sugars are gone already, the alchol level is up, and there's a lot of dissoved CO2.  And I don't want to get into bag vs no bag discussion, but otherwise, from a sanitization perspective, are there other, possibly better, techniques?  Do some folks not even soak the bag in sanitizer and get away with it?</p>

I used this in a dubbel before (pre-fermentation), and while it mainly fermented out, but gave the beer a FANTASTIC nose (probably linked up well with the dark malts).  </p>

"2 Temperature Control Questions - difference in ambient temp; moisture control in chest freezer","<p>I use a chest freezer with a Brewpad heating element stuck to the inside wall (for warmer fermentations/bottle conditioning), and a single-stage Johnson controller.  Since getting this, I haven't used the freezer's compressor to cool the chamber, only the heating element, as ambient temps in my basement have been in the low 60's, and I haven't done any lagers or overly cold fermentations (yet).  I have my temp controller probe taped to the outside of an Ale Pail/carboy, insulated by scrap styrofoam.  However, since we had a non-winter in Maryland and it is getting warmer, my basement is now right around 70 degrees.  </p>

<p>I switched the jumpers on my controller to a 'cooling' setup (""cut-out at setpoint"").  Just last night, I made an extract stout that I want to ferment at 67 degrees.  After getting the temperature inside the chest to around 67, I taped the probe onto the fermenter and went to bed.  checked this morning and both the ambient temp of the freezer and the fermenter read 67 degrees.  However, I went home for lunch, and the ambient temp was down to 58 degrees (!), with the fermenter temp holding at 68.  My question is, with huge swings like this, won't the ambient temp ultimately bring down the fermenter temp even if the controller is 'not trying to', when the walls of the freezer are cold from the compressor, and the chest is sealed shut and providing insulation?</p>

<p>I understand that fermentation (active signs this morning and this afternoon) can create some decent heat from the anaerobic reactions, but is there a way to control this to a greater extent, or does it matter?</p>

<p>My other question is how/if anyone manages moisture inside a chest freezer fermentation chamber set up.  Even with minimal compressor activity, it has kicked up quite a bit of humidity inside.</p>

"How well does liquid yeast travel?","<p>I have often heard people talking about the viability of pitchable liquid yeast either in a vial or smack pack dropping over time. This effect is greatly accelerated with increased temperature, so storing the yeast cold without freezing will slow down the drop in viability.</p>

"Effects of Grain Freshness on Brew House Efficiency","<p>Background:  My co-brewer (ScottyG) and I recently brewed our first all-grain in a converted Coleman cooler.  We have over sixty batches of extract under our belts and have even made a few hard ciders and a batch of mead.  I freely admit, we are a bit late in getting around to going all-grain, but we’ve learned a LOT in our 60+ batches of extract+steeping grains.</p>

<p>We didn’t have high expectations for the first batch.  We did some experiments to approximate temperature drops in the cooler (surprisingly little) and made sure we were using proper procedure.  (following via ScottyG) *We used 10# of grain (9# Marris Otter, 1# Simpson's Dark Crystal) and 1.5 qt/lb for both mashing and sparging. Doughed in at 153, added 1 pint of boiling water. We let it rest for 60 min and the final temp was 149 F. Sparge water was 168 F, and we let it soak for 20 minutes before draining.</p>

<p>We did not: 1) Test pH 2) Test with iodine</p>

<p>First runnings were 2.4 gal @ 1.054, second runnings were 4.6 gal @ 1.012. Final was 7.1 gal @ 1.026 for an efficiency of 50%.*   Much lower than we had expected, much lower than our software or hand calculations projected.  The first running was about the SG we expected from the second.</p>

<p>We used some pre-crushed grain that was about a year old. (crushed at Northern Brewer about a year ago). It was from a kit a friend bought for us to make and had mistakenly got all-grain.  We are reasonably certain that our troubles come from old grain, crushed a year ago.  (BTW, we augmented with some extract to bring the resulting beer up to an acceptable SG. (Yay, it’s gonna be a beer!)</p>

<p>Now after all that setup, here’s the question:  </p>

<p>What effect does the age of the grain have on the amount of fermentables you can mash out of it?  Does the crush decrease the “freshness window?”   </p>

<p>TL;DR What effect does old grain have, especially if it was crushed in the past.</p>

"What do you do with the vodka from your ferm locks?","<p>I would've thought the answer was obvious, seeing as how it's alcohol.  But I took a whiff, and it smells like fermentation.  Now I like fermentation, it means beer is on its way.  I don't like fermentation flavored vodka.</p>

<p>First, is there some reason why drinking this would actually be bad?  Can't imagine alcohol being bad for you, just curious.</p>

<p>Second, any ideas on what to mix it with?  I know I can experiment, but if it doesn't work, I'll be committing alcohol abuse, and that's going to ruin my brew day.</p>

<p>I know this might sound on the edge of homebrew question, talking about vodka, but I believe this is a semi-common byproduct of the brewing process.</p>

"Yeast attenuation and fermentable sugars","<p>I'm a little confused about this and can't find an answer that satisfies my curiosity... I've found a helpful thread (<a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/4976/what-does-high-attentuation-actually-mean-in-terms-of-types-of-sugar-fermented"">What does high attentuation actually mean in terms of types of sugar fermented?</a>) but it doesn't really sort me out. Perhaps someone can help break it down for a noob... :)</p>

<p>I understand that your wort will contain a certain amount of fermentable sugars, and some unfermentable. I believe this to be around 60%-70% (depending on your grain choice, mash temperature, etc.).</p>

<p>Then we have yeast attenuation rates, which appear to be anything around 60%-85% depending on the strain, but this appears to be a mechanism for comparing different yeast types in a 100% fermentable sugar solution.</p>

<p>Does this mean that any particular yeast can only ferment, say, 75% of the fermentable sugars? So somewhere around 50% of the actual sugars in the wort will be converted to alcohol?</p>

<p>I'm sure this can't be the case and I must be missing something important here... what is the importance of understanding yeast attenuation?</p>

<p>I intend to buy BeerSmith at some point but I'm just at the beginning of the road at the moment so I'd like to get my head around the entire process as much as I can.</p>

"carboy exploded while cleaning","<p>I just tried to clean out a 6.5 gallon carboy that I had used for primary fermentation. First, I hit it with hot water and dumped it out. Then, I put about a half-gallon of hot water with some dish soap. No more than five seconds after I began scrubbing the carboy with an angled brush, there was a loud explosion, and the carboy broke into four pieces in the sink. The temperature of the beer was around 60°F, and the temperature of the water was about 125°F. What, if anything, did I do wrong? Was it just a bad carboy or did I commit a fundamental mistake? What is the proper way to clean a glass carboy?</p>

I also added sugar to the mix per one recipe to raise the alcohol content.</p>

"How much of given boil volume should be used for mash and sparge?","<p>I'm just about to try my first all grain brew this weekend... Slightly nervous :)</p>

<p>I'm going to make the Black Sheep Ale recipe available from the hop and grain database... Being in Yorkshire it seems appropriate and I think it should suit my water.</p>

<p>The brew details are these:</p>

<p>Batch Size: 21.00 L 
Boil Size: 29.68 L
Estimated OG: 1.046 SG
Estimated Color: 28.2 EBC
Estimated IBU: 35.9 IBU
Brewhouse Efficiency: 70.00 %
Boil Time: 90 Minutes</p>

<p>Other than an ingredients list this is the only information provided by the recipe... so...</p>

<p>My main question at this point is, out of the 29.68 litre boil size, how much do I mash with? And how much do I sparge with? Do I just work it out if a 1.5qt to 1lb ratio (or similar)?</p>

<p>Also... I'm going for a 66C single temperature mash... Is that appropriate?</p>

<p>I assume, also, that if I boil 29.68 litres for 90 minutes I will arrive at a final volume of 21 litres?</p>

"Kegged Beer Not Staying Carbonated","<p>This summer I kegged a pale ale for the first time. For about the first week or so the carbonation level on the beer was great but then the beer started to get flat (still tasted good, just no bubbles). I carbonated with priming sugar.</p>

<p>Once the beer started getting I did the ""soap test"", putting soapy water at all the connection points on the C02 canister, keg, and lines. There were no bubbles so I don't think I have a leak, this conclusion is (I think) backed up by the fact that the C02 canister is holding at a steady level.</p>

<p>I don't have a kegerator so the keg was kept in my garage at a temp between 65-75F. I'm using a corny keg with ball locks. Prior to kegging I replaced all the o rings on the keg.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the ease of kegging and would like to continue doing it but I'd like to figure out what I did to cause my beer to go flat so I don't do it again.</p>

<p>What's causing my beer to go flat? A leak (how should I test for it)? Is the relatively high storage temperature to blame? I'm really at a loss and would love some insight.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>

<p>Sounds like my problem is incorrect pressure for my storage temp. I'm planning to get a kegerator early next year to put this to the test.</p>

"Is my fermentation on the right track?","<p>I upgraded my equipment and estimated my new efficiency a bit too low, so the imperial IPA that I brewed on 11/30 ended up having an O.G. of 1.10 (supposed to be 1.09). I made a two step starter with White Labs California Ale (WLP001). The first step was 2L, and the second was a bit smaller at 1.2L since the first step went overboard a bit out of the erlenmeyer flask. I oxygenated with pure O2 for a minute and a few seconds before pitching. There was a little bit of bubbling the first 18 hours, but not much action until after 24 hours. It was really active for a week, and is now slowing down. There's still a 3/4"" krausen, and I took a reading of 1.033 today (12/12). I'm looking to get to at least 1.02 (hopefully). The original recipe was supposed to finish around 1.01. I also should mention that I've been rousing the carboy occasionally. Not that it matters, but here's a bubble every 10 - 15 seconds in the air lock, 6.5 gallon carboy.</p>

<p>Should I pitch more yeast, or wait it out? I don't like leaving it on the trub for more than 3 weeks, but I don't want to rack to secondary until it's close to what I want.

"How to store leftover fermenting wine for reuse later?","<p>I've got a decent amount of leftover wine (ginger) after racking from my primary to a couple of demijohns.

<p>My question ultimately is can I leave this leftover in the bottle with some muslin wrapped over it and then use it top up my demijohns when I'm reracking?

"identifying sediment layers in yeast washing","<p>I'm washing the yeast from a brew I've just bottled and it's not settling quite how I am expecting with my limited (once before) experience.</p>

<p>This fermentation was with a fresh packet of dried Danstar Windsor yeast, so this is a first generation population and I was very careful with my sanitation.</p>

<p>I rinsed the fermenter trub with cool boiled water and poured it into a sanitised jar.</p>

<p>An hour later the obvious gunge had settled out so poured the milky yeast fluid off into another sanitised jar, discarding the last inch with the trub.</p>

<p>This morning I have a jar containing four distinct layers. From top to bottom...</p>

<ul>
<li>liquid (well, obviously :)</li>
<li>very thin pale layer</li>
<li>very thick darker patchy layer</li>
<li>thin pale layer</li>
</ul>

<p>The third, patchy looking layer is by far the most voluminous and, although it is yeasty in colour, it seems to be made more from two yeast tones, light and dark.</p>

<p>Instinct tells me (which could easily be incorrect!) that the lighter layers are good and the darker layer contains stuff I don't want.</p>

<p>If I include this layer in my yeast harvest I'll end up with a healthy harvest (about 400ml), however if I manage to separate it out I'll be left with very little.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p><strong>Edit...</strong> managed to upload a picture now!</p>

<p><strong>Edit...</strong> a few hours have passed and it looks like the top light layer is settling through the darker layer and, perhaps, the light component is settling out of the darker band. Perhaps in a few more hours I'll be left with a very thick deposit of a dark substance on top of a thin light layer. Which is the good stuff? All of it?</p>

"Effect of Long, High, Decling-Temperature Mash on Wort","<p>Due to time constraints, I need to do a two- to 2-1/2 hour <em>unattended</em> mash, and then return to lauter, etc.  I plan to do a single batch sparge.  I am looking for a slightly-less fermentable wort for more body, so I theorize that my ideal mash profile is a single-temperature rest at around 156-158°F (69-70°C). However, my non-heated mash tun is going to lose around 15°F (8.3°C) over 2-2.5 hrs., I estimate**.  So I need to mash in higher. I don't have the ability to add more strike water mid-mash because I am maxed out on MLT space, and will not be around to do it.</p>

<p>Q1: What sort of wort profile can I expect if I mash-in at 162°F (72°C) , and end up at 147°F (64°C) over 2-2.5 hrs.?  John Palmer says in <a href=""http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter14-5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">How to Brew</a> that beta-amylase is denatured at 154-162°F (68-72°C), but I have seen other writers say that overnight mashes lead to very fermentable worts and dry beers.</p>

<p>Q2: Does the mash-in temp determine the fermentability of the wort, or is it based on the whole mash?</p>

<p>Q3: Besides buying a new cooler, do you have any advice in terms of tips, techniques, or mashing temps?</p>

<p>In case it matters, this is a partial-mash recipe; 2.5 gallon (9.5 L) batch (fermenter volume).  My malt bill is 4.2 lbs. (1.9 kg) of grain (71% Golden Promise, and 23% Belgian Caramunich, 8% 160°L crystal), mashed at 1-1/3 qts./lb (0.57 L/kg), plus 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) of DME.  Yeast: Danstar Nottingham.</p>

<ul>
<li>** My two-gallon (7.6 L) beverage cooler mash tun loses 10°F (5.6°C) in one hour without a blanket, but I have added insulation to the lid and plan to wrap in a blanket, so I expect a maximum 15°F (8.3°C) loss over 2-2.5 hrs. I <em>do</em> preheat the cooler with 185°F (85°C) water. The lack of thermal mass, and inefficiency of cold beverage coolers to keep contents hot, are drawbacks of small batch brewing. This is the first time I am trying for a less-fermentable wort.</li>

"Late Mash Additions for Color","<p>I was looking for color in a recipe without any of the roastiness from dark crystal malt I would get from using it as steeped specialty grains. When I asked the manager at the LHBS about cold steeping, he instead recommended ""late mashing"". He told me to use a slightly darker crystal malt, and add it as a late mash addition in the last 10-15 minutes of the mash. Apparently, several breweries in my area have been doing this, per that guy.</p>

<p>I can't find much information on techniques, except <a href=""http://beercitadel.blogspot.com/2012/07/late-mash-additions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog post</a>, and these forum posts: <a href=""http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/forum/index.php?topic=3858.0"" rel=""nofollow"">link 1</a>; <a href=""http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f36/late-mash-dark-grain-addition-120334/"" rel=""nofollow"">link 2</a>.</p>

"Consistently high final gravity","<p>I started brewing about a year ago, currently on my sixth batch, all using extract and some additional grains. My problem is that my beers consistently finish with a higher than expected final gravity. For the life of me, I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>My latest batch is the biggest failure yet. I don't think I can bottle it like it is. I modified the all-grain recipe linked below to use extract for the base malt. I did a ""mini-mash"" with the other grains (crystal, chocolate, smoked, black patent). The temperature at the end of the mash was 150F. I substituted 6 lbs. pale LME and 10 oz. pale DME for the base malt. I upped the second hop addition to a full 1 oz.</p>

<p>I plugged this recipe into Brew Target. It said my OG should be ~1.046 and my FG should be ~1.013. My OG was right on target when I pitched the yeast. I pitched one packet of hydrated Nottingham yeast at 74F. The airlock started bubbling within a few hours, went strong for about a day, and then just stopped. After 10 days, the gravity was 1.022. The taste is rather bland, not particularly sweet or bitter or ... anything else, really.</p>

<p>I used tap water from the filtered dispenser on my refrigerator. I aerated by shaking vigorously in the fermenter for a few minutes before pitching the yeast. Fermentation temperature is a consistent 68F.</p>

<p>I asked the proprietor at my LHBS for help. He gave me some yeast energizer and high attenuating ale yeast to try to get it going again. I gently stirred in the energizer and sprinkled the yeast on top. That was about 18 hours ago, and it shows zero activity right now.</p>

<p>Other examples:<br>
    Imperial IPA, OG 1.094, expected FG 1.023, actual FG 1.028<br>
    Pale Ale, OG 1.052, expected FG 1.013, actual FG 1.018  </p>

<p>These things start out with the right OG, but they just stop fermenting and refuse to go any further.</p>

"Analytics for Beer","<p>So, I am very new to home brewing, my first batch has been fermenting for about a week.  I have been a beer enthusiast for years, so I am really enthusiastic about this new hobby of mine.  By trade, I am a computer scientist and I specialize in data analytics.  I use a tool called QlikView, to build analytical applications, and it is really powerful in spotting relationships between data.</p>

<p>So, I have an idea to build up a database (really, just a series of Excel Spreadsheets) and then load them into a QlikView application to allow us home brewers to do some analysis on the composition of existing beers, to allow us to ""tinker"" with a recipe based on ingredients that are shared in beers we like.</p>

<p>An example I can think of... say I have three favorite IPAs, if I saw that they all share a common hop then I would view this as a hop I must really like in a beers.  The idea would be to try to build up new recipes based on common components across potentially different clusters of beers someone may like.  This could extend beyond just the ingredients, also into the brewing process and additions, etc.</p>

<p>So, my question is, has anyone tried something like this?  (obviously, not necessarily in the tool I am suggesting).  Also, is there a good repository of beer recipes out there I could use to seed this database?  Also, would anyone be interested in joining in such a project?</p>

"Is this a sign of improper carbonation or improper bottling?","<p>This is a story of two very different pours from the same batch.  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> the first bottle was foamy and very carbonated, the second was normal, but the first bottle went flat and was cloudy, while the second bottle was within normal range for head, carbonation, and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong> I poured a bottle for a friend into a hand-rinsed, standard pint glass, pouring the first half down the side and the second half down the middle, being careful not to disturb or pour the lees. When I opened it, I noticed some bubbling in the neck, but no gusher. The beer was fairly foamy, very bubbly, with a head that dissipated very quickly.</p>

<p>I immediately opened a second bottle for myself, noticed the same bubbling, but got sidetracked and did not pour for about 10 minutes. Same type of glass and pouring technique. However, my beer had a nice head, that lasted a little while, and carbonation was normal.</p>

<p>When were about halfway through both beers at the same time, and noticed that my friend's beer had gone sort of flat with no lacing and was a little cloudy, while mine was still carbonated, and was pretty clear (you could see through it when held up to light). (By the way, the beer was somewhat green, and hopefully will benefit from more time in the bottle.)</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> Is this a sign of improper carbonation, or could it be due to inadequate mixing in the fermenter before I bottled?  I.e., maybe I racked too much beer into bottles and should have left more in the fermenter. Or maybe something different? I have never had bottles that varied from bottle to bottle before.</p>

"Stirring Spoon Hop Stained","<p>So... I will just start with sharing that ""Hop Stained"" has a nice ring to it for an IPA name, but I digress to my question.</p>

<p>During my first batch, I am becoming paranoid I did not pay enough attention to cleaning throughout my boil.  I kept a bucket with sanitizer and kept all instruments in there when I wasn't using them, except my stirring spoon.  This was because I was stirring my wort nearly constantly, and after the boil and even after I cleaned the soon, there is still a green tint to it from the hops I imagine.</p>

<p>Is this normal?  Does this mean I didn't clean well enough?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Chris</p>

"filling the airlock","<p>I'm brewing my first batch ever, and got a little worried that it wasn't bubbling after 24 hours as the instructions said it should. I've read a lot on here that says not to worry about a bubbling airlock, but I do have a question.</p>

<p>It does seem to be fermenting, it's been 2 days. I can see a krausen through the plastic. And today I noticed the airlock is indeed pressurized. The instructions called to fill the airlock about halfway. I missed the mark and filled it about three quarters.</p>

<p>Now here's the thing. I can clearly see there is pressure in the bucket. I can press on the lid, and see the airlock bubble. When I stop pressing on the lid, the airlock equalizes, then shortly shows pressure in the fermenter again. Yet I see no bubbling. Could this be due to the fact the airlock is filled too much? Has anyone else seen this kind of behaviour?</p>

<p>Lastly, thanks to all of the people on here, it's relieved many worries, with the simple DWHAHB. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
It's a 5 gallon batch in a 6 gallon white plastic bucket. I put a flashlight on the lid, turned off the lights, and could distinctly see different light levels, dark at the 5 gallon mark, kinda chunky brown about an inch and a half above that, and empty above that. Three piece airlock.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>
Checked the gravity tonight, and found 1.007. So I think it's done. Perhaps I had a leak on the lid, perhaps I just didn't notice it fermented in the day I was at work. In either case, I've put it in the secondary fermenter (yes, I know it's not necessary, but I want to clear it up a bit). I smelled it, and it smells almost like Sierra Nevada Torpedo, tasted it, and I can clearly taste the hops flavor and bitterness. It seems it turned out okay. I'll check the gravity again on Sunday, and if unchanged, bottle it. FWIW original gravity was 1.058, but that could be off, it was hard to measure around the froth after transferring to the primary fermenter. Either way, I'm within 0.005 of the kits specs, so I think I'm good.</p>

"Newbie brewer: beer sample tastes strange","<p>my first batch was a little tricky, lots of mistakes made. Ive got some questions.</p>

<p>Its a Pale Ale (US-05) (6.5 pounds of Pilsen malt - 1.5 pound of Carared - 1 pound of Oat Malt - 0.8 pounds of Crystal 50 malt - 0.4 pounds of Flaked oats), <strong>OG 1052 and FG 1017</strong>, did a hop stand with around 4oz. <strong>Beer sample tasted strange, not even close to a medium bodied beer, not sweet despite the FG.</strong> </p>

<p>Its quite bitter and with lots of hop flavor, which would be pleasant, but its not. It was a <strong>5gal</strong> batch but I ended up with <strong>only 3.9gal</strong> in primary fermentor. Beersmith said IBU would be 40, but since I got less beer, it <strong>will be more bitter, correct?</strong></p>

<p>It fermented for <strong>10 days in 68ºF</strong>. Secondary temperature is <strong>42ºF</strong>. Is that right? How long should I leave it there to build body and malt flavor? Since it is already pretty hopped, with strange hop characteristics (well, I used 8 types of hops... dumb thing), should I dry hop?</p>

<p>It has been at 42F for 4 days now... Can I raise it to 65ºF without any bad consequences?</p>

"How to raise pH (or lower acidity) of mead","<p>I have a mead that I think has too high of an acid level.  I am looking for ways to raise the pH or lower the acidity<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Roughly 7 months ago, I made a 5 gal batch of mead.  The original fermentation got stuck, so I added some FermaidK based upon the local brew shop's recommendation.  Initial OG was 1.116, and I added FermaidK at 1.088 and again at 1.042.  I can't find the measurement prior to racking, but I think it was around 1.002.</p>

<p>So after sitting for about 6 months in the carboy, the clarity is pretty decent but the mead has a pretty boozy aroma to it.  I haven't had many meads, so I don't know how to describe the flavor.  It was tasty enough, but perhaps seems really bright.  Drinkable but not quite amazing...</p>

<p>I used an acid titration kit to measure the acid level.  With 15 cc of my mead and 3 drops of phenolphthalein, it took 7.5 cc of .2N sodium hydroxide to trigger the color change.  According to the instructions I have, that's a .75% tartaric acid level but the recommended range for mead is .30 - .50%.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I need to do anything to lower the acid level / raise the pH of my mead?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, what should I use given that I'm essentially ready to bottle excepting this possible acid level issue.</p></li>
</ol>

"Mash rests and water to grist ratio","<p>I am planning brewing a recipe I found of a porter that I am really excited about. The original recipe says that you should do a rest at temperature below final mash temperature for a bit. After some research I found that with today's highly modified malts, these more complex mash schedules are not necessary. So my first question is, is this true? Can I just forego the rest temperature and go for the final mash temp?</p>

<p>Second, if the overall opinion is that this rest is necessary, It makes me curious about water to grist ratio. Are you supposed to dough in at a lower ratio so that when you step up your temperature with some hot water to hit your mash temp that you end up with the desired ratio? Or do you do you dough in at the lower temp with the correct ratio, then when you bump up the temp, let the ratio slide so you have a higher water to grist ratio?</p>

"Increased Magnum hops in a Fat Tire Clone","<p>So I brewed the book ""Beer Captured""'s Fat Tire Clone the other day.
I made a few slight variations. One being I used Wyeast 1056 instead of a Belgian Yeast because I figured since it's not a Belgian Ale why use a Belgian yeast (I also contacted New Belgium Brewery and the confirmed my theory and said I was on the right track)</p>

<p>My other change though was that it calls for .33oz of Magnum Hops (14%AA)
The Magnum hops I had were only 12.5%AA, so I was going to bump it up to .66oz and the IBUs would come out at 26.4. (The book said IBU of 21). I had 1oz of Magnum, and I'm kind of a hophead, so I ended up bumping it up to .75oz which put the IBUs around 30.</p>

<p>My other hop additions are a .5oz Hallertauer (4.3%AA) at 15mins
and .25oz Willamette (4%AA) at flameout.</p>

<p>Now I haven't really experimented too much with changing recipes. I mostly stick to the book. But, now I'm thinking should I have bumped up the other hops as well? With the higher amount of Alpha Acids from the Magnums, will the bitterness overpower any hop aroma from the late additions since they weren't increased at all? I know I'll just have to wait and see, but my question is if I increase the bittering hops in a recipe, should you also increase your flavor/aroma hops as well to help balance it out?</p>

While I like Grolsch swingtops better (and my Dad loves that he can use the bottles for his brew) it's much more expensive and harder to find. Coopers is a family-owned brewery in South Australia, it's one of the few independent breweries left whose products can be found nationally.</p>

<p>Two questions about this bottle-conditioned ale:</p>

<p>I prefer the 750ml size to the 375ml size. I always feel the beer from the large bottle has a much fuller taste and more intense bitterness to it. I've tried chilling both equally and pouring into the same sized glass. There could be variation due to batch but then some of the time I would expect to prefer the small bottle. Can this be explained by the larger volume of the bottle particularly as this is bottle-conditioned ale? </p>

<p>As much as I like this stuff it can sometimes give me the shade of a hangover from just one bottle. It's a heavy-ish beer at 5.8% ABV but an equivalent alcohol volume consumed as some other drink doesn't do it. I'm not talking about the home brew version here so it isn't my fault. Can I attribute this to the yeast in the bottle or to something else?</p>

<p>Is my juice infected and if so, can I still save it? Why are the white particles only localized in the middle and not going towards the edges?</p>

<p>Is it possible that the wild-yeast content is not high enough, and that I should get a commercial yeast? Please, any suggestions are welcome!</p>

"Fermentation started right after air-locking, but stopped after a few hours","<p>I have 30L of pressed apples. After getting the wild yeast started in one week, I put an air-lock on. This is how my carboy looked right after that operation:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRqVx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRqVx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I used organic raw apple cider vinegar as a sanitizing solution in the air-lock. Hope that was a good idea. Anyways, air-lock bubbled for an hour or so right after being set, but after one hour, air-lock activity has stopped. Still, there's a healthy couple fingers of foam on top of the brew, just like in the original picture.</p>

<p>Should I espect air-lock activity to come back within the next few hours/days? Is it normal to get good air-lock activity right after air-locking the carboy and then having it stopped for a while?</p>

<p>I'm a beginner so hope this question is still interesting! Any advice is welcome.</p>

"Can I add some water before I bottle?","<p>I'm in the final stages of my very first beer, which is a Belgian wit. Everything has gone great so far, and I will be bottling in just a few days. I have a pretty high alcohol content (around 8.2%, which I would like to bring down), and I think my volume is the reason;  I only have maybe 4 gallons of beer. </p>

<p>When bottling day comes, I will be boiling some sugar and adding that to my beer before I bottle. My question is, can I boil the sugar in say a gallon of water, and add that? I want to bring my alcohol content down a bit, and hopefully lighten the color of the beer. </p>

<p>It would make sense to me that I could do this, since what I have right now is essentially a ""slightly dehydrated"" beer. If I can do this, then at what point do I take my ""final"" hydrometer reading?</p>

<p>So the questions again, in quick and to the point form:
1. Can I add a gallon of water to my beer before bottling?
2. If I do this, when do I take a ""final"" hydrometer reading?</p>

"Fermentation locations","<p>Where is the ideal place to ferment my beer?</p>

<p>Possible locations for me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extra room inside</li>
<li>Garage</li>
<li>Back porch</li>
</ul>

<p>Of those three places, which would be the best overall place? </p>

"Why should I start lagering?","<p>I'm contemplating my next brew equipment purchase, and it's likely to be a chest freezer, either for lagering or for converting into a kegerator.  </p>

<p>I know some of the things I've heard, but what are the compelling characteristics that only lagering can produce?</p>

<p>I've heard it described as a clean, crisp character.  Is there either a more technical, or different way of describing this effect, and is it the sole purpose?</p>

"What are some ways to make low-carb beer?","<p>I and a few friends have dabbled with the various ""low carb"" diets.  But I've found that after a while, you don't want to break the diet, but just want a beer.</p>

<p>What are some ways to make a beer recipe lower carb?</p>

<p>Bonus question: Is there a way to calculate how many carbs/sugars are in the beer?  I think the fermentation process would mean that sugars that were in the beer are no longer (hence the falling gravity), but what does a FG of (say 1.010) mean in terms of how many grams of carbs/sugars in a beer?</p>

"Adding potassium metabisulphite (i.e. sulfites) to prevent oxidation?","<p>Winemakers often add potassium metabisulphite to the finished product for two purposes: To prevent further yeast growth (so that they do not eat the remaining sugars) and as a preservative, to prevent oxidation.</p>

<p>Since oxidation is a big concern for brewers, do any homebrewers out there add sulfites to your beers, in order to prevent oxidation and staling?  If so, what are the relevant concerns, and has the result been good?</p>

"help: Beer smells bad","<p>This is my 4th batch (I'm new), but first Belgian ale.  Kit from here: <a href=""http://www.midwestsupplies.com/flat-tire.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.midwestsupplies.com/flat-tire.html</a></p>

<p>I also did another batch at the same time (different kit) and it seems fine and all my batches up to this point have been ok.  It's been 7 days and I transfered it to a secondary fermenter (cause it says it has heavy sediment and trying to clear some of that out).</p>

<p>Anyways it smells like someone took a crap in a dirty gym sock and dropped that into my beer :(  That indicates it has spoiled right?  Is there any way I can recover this or do I just throw the entire thing out?  Seems such a waste to dump the entire thing out.</p>
"
"Adding cherry extract at bottling time?","<p>I have made Cherry ale around Christmas for several years.  This year I forgot to add the cherry extract at the 2nd fermentation, so I added it when I added the sugar prior to bottling.  Will this affect the taste?  could it have effect on carbonation?  My beer this year is flat and has an aftertaste that I don't like. </p>
