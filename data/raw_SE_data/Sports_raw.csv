"Are there official rules for touch rugby?","<p>Touch rugby is a sport widely played in New Zealand and Australia, similar to rugby league except the main difference is that the person with the ball is touched instead of tackled.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge (mine, and Google's), there is no official rules for touch rugby, or even a touch rugby federation or similar.</p>

<p>This is a big problem in games at school, where technical points get brought up and no-one knows how to handle this.</p>

<p><strong>Are there official rules for touch rugby</strong>? If so, where can I find them and who were they made by?</p>

"Should Jorgensen have been sent off for his DOGSO foul in Croatia-Denmark (2018 FIFA World Cup)?","<p>I am of course referring to the foul that occurred at the 113th minute of the round of 16 match between Croatia and Denmark, when Rebić would have scored an easy goal had he not been fouled in the box by Jorgensen:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7x7y.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7x7y.png"" alt=""Jorgensen&#39;s foul""></a></p>

<p>As we know, a penalty kick was awarded but Jorgensen was only cautioned. Everyone seemed to agree with this decision, on the basis that Jorgensen did try to play the ball. And trust me, I <strong><em>believe</em></strong> this. The following image makes it clear that Jorgensen was attempting to play the ball:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PWvly.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PWvly.png"" alt=""Jorgensen does attempt to play the ball""></a> </p>

<p>Yet the point I'm trying to make is different. <strong>Is the fact Jorgensen was trying to get the ball enough to downgrade the red card to a simple yellow card in this case?</strong> People who agree with the referee's decision end up quoting this part of the <a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/fouls-and-misconduct-2018/chapters/disciplinary-action-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2018/19 Laws of the Game</a> (Law 12, p. 108):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned <strong><em>if the offence was an attempt to play the ball;</em></strong> in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.) the offending player must be sent off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But read it carefully: this paragraph is only referring to situations where <strong>an obvious goal-scoring opportunity</strong> is denied. To see why this is important, let's have a look at what the rulebook says just one page earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:</em> (...) <strong><em>denying a goal</em></strong> or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the rule is actually about <em>two</em> distinct situations: <strong>denying a goal</strong> <em>OR</em> an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. It is also clear that 'denying a goal' doesn't only occur when a player deliberately handles the ball on the goal line, because</p>

<ul>
<li>this paragraph is specifically about offences committed against an opposing player, and</li>
<li>the situation where the ball is deliberately handled is already discussed in the previous bullet point, and again the Law makes a difference between denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (<em>""denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball""</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, as the first image clearly shows (and as everyone who has watched the match knows), the goal was empty (the goalkeeper, Schmeichel, was almost <em>outside</em> the penalty area): a tap-in would have been enough for Rebić to score a goal. And seeing how the Laws of the Game <strong><em>do</em></strong> make a distinction between </p>

<ol>
<li>fouling an opponent and denying a goal, or</li>
<li>fouling an opponent and denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity...</li>
</ol>

<p>...well, then it looks to me that this is the clearest example of what 'denying a goal by fouling an opponent' should be.</p>

<p>So, <strong>why did the referee apply that special provision of Law 12 that allowed him to only give a yellow card to Jorgensen, when this exception is only valid in situations when an obvious goal-scoring opportunity is denied?</strong></p>

<p>After all, that paragraph was added to Law 12 because a penalty kick effectively restores the goal-scoring opportunity that was lost, so sending off the offending player would have been too much (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/fouls-and-misconduct-2018/chapters/fouls-and-misconduct-faq-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 12 FAQ #9</a>): indeed, the chance of scoring on a penalty kick is roughly 80%, which is more or less the same chance of scoring that an attacking player has when facing only the goalkeeper during open play. But in this situation, the chance of scoring was easily 99%: the penalty kick does <strong>NOT</strong> fully make up for the previous situation, and this is why I think the Laws of the Game make a distinction between the two cases.</p>

<p>So, was cautioning Jorgensen a mistake under the current Laws of the Game? Or are there any other official rules/interpretations that justify a yellow card and that I'm unaware of?</p>

"Who comes out of the penalty box after goal?","<ol>
<li><p>Suppose that Team 1 has players Adam and Bob. Adam takes a double minor penalty, and during the powerplay, Bob takes a 2 minute minor. Then, on the 5-on-3 powerplay, Team 2 scores a goal. Assuming that Adam still has more than 2 minutes left on his penalty, does Bob come out of the box, moving to a 5-on-4 powerplay for the duration of Adam's penalty, or does Adam's penalty time get reduced to 2 minutes, and the 5-on-3 continues?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that Team 1 has players Adam, Bob, and Chuck. Adams takes a 2 minute minor, then Bob takes a 2 minute minor during that penalty, and then during the 5-on-3, Chuck takes another 2 minute minor. Now, I believe that it's the case that Team 1 plays 5-on-3, but Chuck's penalty time doesn't start until Adam's is finished. Also, assuming that there's no stoppage in play, when Adam's time is finished, he doesn't immediately exit the box. However, if Bob's penalty time also finishes before a stoppage in play, then Adam comes out of the box to bring Team 1 to 5-on-4? Furthermore, if there is still no stoppage in play, and Chuck's penalty time finishes, then Bob comes out of the box putting both teams at even strength, and then Chuck comes out at the next stoppage in play? Also, how might things change if Adam or Bob had a major penalty?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that we have Adam and Bob on Team 1 and Zack on Team 2. Adam and Zack take offsetting 2 minute minors, and while play is 4-on-4, Bob takes a penalty, but Team 2 scores before Team 1 can touch the puck. Does Adam come out of the box and Bob goes in, with 4-on-4 continuing until Zack comes out of the box, or does Adam stay in the box, and Bob doesn't go to the box?</p></li>

"What will be the Davis Cup format from 2019?","<p>Currently, the Davis Cup consists in a series of heats throughout the year (on February, March, May and November, if I recall properly), each one where the winner needs to get three matches to make it to the next round. The location of the matches is the country of one of the countries in the heat.</p>

<p>However, on August 16, 2018, the International Tennis Federation approved a modification of the format of the Davis Cup. Instead of what I described above, there seem to be a kind of Final Four, consisting on a week of matches in a Round-robin system, to get into a final.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24 nations will compete in a home-or-away qualifying round in February, with the 12 winners advancing to the final tournament. They will be joined by the four semifinalists from the previous year, along with two wild-card teams, who need to be in either the top 50 of the Davis Cup rankings or have a top-10 singles player to be eligible.</p>
  
  <p>The finalists will be placed into six, three-team groups for round-robin play, involving two singles matches and one doubles, all best-of-three-sets — instead of the current best-of-five format featuring four singles matches and one doubles. The winners, along with the next two teams with the best records, will advance to the single-elimination quarterfinals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, I have some questions about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>How will those 24 countries selected?</li>
<li>What will the format be exactly?</li>
<li>Will the results count towards the ATP ranking? (<a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/a/15879/11439"">Since they 2016 do not</a>)</li>

<p>The Rays have then ""started"" Glasnow in four games, for 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.2 innings, respectively. He is regarded as a powerful hurler with a good strikeout rate, but more of a long reliever than a true starter. Yet the Rays have used him in a ""hybrid"" role, with the hope of eventually developing a starter. In two of these games, other starters, Jake Faria, and Ryan Yarborough ""relieved"" Glasnow, and picked upt the wins.</p>

<p>The Pirates actually had three potential starters of this type: Glasnow, Chad Kuhl (now injured), and Steve Brault? Why not have a ""fifth starter by committee"" e.g. have Glasnow, Kuhl and Brault start on the 5th, 10th, and 15th day of a cycle, with the other two as backups during those games?</p>

"Hand setting a hard driven ball (beach volleyball)","<p>In <a href=""https://www.fivb.org/EN/Refereeing-Rules/Documents/FIVB-BeachVolleyball_Rules_2017-2020-EN-v05.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">FIVB Offical Beach Volleyball Rules 2017-2020</a>, which rule allows for a double contact while using an overhand finger action on a hard driven ball?</p>

<p>I see an exception for Extended contacts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9.2.2.4 Extended contacts: In defensive action of a hard driven ball, the ball contact can be extended momentarily even if an overhand
  finger action is used.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The only information I found supporting the double contact was from the <a href=""http://www.fivb.org/EN/Refereeing-Rules/documents/2015-Beach-Volleyball-Rules-Casebook.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2015 Beach Volleyball Rules Casebook</a>, case 5.3.11 (5.20)</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5.3.11 (5.20) Is it allowed to play a ball as a hard driven ball (i.e. by momentary extended contact with hands) if the ball is coming from
  the opponent’s block? Ruling</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Answer</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. This is legal if satisfying the requirements of a hard driven
  ball defence. The ball rebounding or being deflected off the block is
  considered as an attack hit and in this case the ball may be caught
  momentarily with hands. <strong>It may also be double contacted with fingers</strong>.

"Squash: Is there a 'correct' flow to a game?","<p>I see pro squash players, in a match, making many repetitive shots along the side wall, cycling in and out of position. At times, it almost looks like they're doing a drill, not actually trying to win the point. In my own games with my longtime partner, I frequently try to win a point with a kill shot off his serve, or otherwise try to win the point as quickly as possible. Our rallies often last only a few shots.</p>

<p>I guess my question is almost about the philosophy of the game. If elite players (not me!!) are capable of making a well-placed drop shot and ending the rally, why don't they? Or is their opponent's shot so difficult that they are only able to barely make a return shot?</p>

"In little league, can an umpire change their ruling based on advice from coaching staff?","<p>In a little league championship game, there have been two outs, with a man on second. The batter hits a home run. The batter runs bases and gets home, but the outfield team notice that he didn't step on third base. </p>

<p>The coaches instruct the pitcher to go back to mound and throw to his third baseman, who tags the base. The umpire then calls the runner out. As a result, the home run doesn't count and this is the third out. </p>

<p>While the other team is celebrating, the team in the outfield leaves the field. The coaches of the team that just hit the home run start questioning what happened. After the umpire explains to them why the batter is out, the coaches start verbally disputing the decision. </p>

<p>After a long discussion with both team coaches, the umpire decides to change his call and allows the home run to count. This is in spite of one of the outfield coaches openly admitting that the player missed third base. </p>

<p>Is there any basis in the rules for the call being changed, or was the original call correct?</p>

<p>Even if the original call was incorrect, is the umpire permitted to change it at this stage once the outfield team has left the field?</p>

<p>Should umpires in little league be making decisions based on input from coaches from either or both teams?</p>

"Why does the fastest racer typically start at the front of the grid?","<p>I've followed racing (cars and bikes) for years, and taken it for granted that the fastest qualifier would take pole position and start at the front of the grid.  A friend asked me why that is, because he thought it gave an additional unfair advantage to drivers that are already proven faster.  I realized I could speculate as to why (e.g. less frivolous passing makes the race safer, faster drivers are not bogged down and forced to lose by being made to pass many times in a limited-time race, simply a merit-based system, etc) but didn't have a concrete answer.</p>

<p>Friend asked why the fastest riders aren't placed at the back of the grid to force them to prove their merit.  Easy answer is, everyone would sandbag the crap out of qualifying, no one would give their best because they'd want to be closer to the front.  Friend asked why the grid isn't just randomized.  My answer is that it removes all merit from the process, as well as the other safety-related item mentioned above.  But I realized that's all my own speculation as to the ""why"" question.</p>

<p>So is it ""just the way it is,"" is it tradition, just a decision that was sort of arbitrarily made, or is there another reason why the fastest driver gets to be on the pole?</p>

<p>I'm aware that there are systems where the fastest qualifier isn't just given the pole, but for the purposes of this question, I'm asking what are the reasons (if any are known) that many high profile racing leagues/series place the fastest driver on pole?</p>

"Why do incoming batsmen always mark the off-stump line?","<p>In cricket, I have often seen that incoming batsmen come in and mark the off-stump line with assistance from the non-striker.

"Wording in MLB slide rule","<p>Forgive me if this question is rather obtuse, but it's been eating away at me, and I figured this was the place to go for help.</p>

<p>The last paragraph of the rule concerning sliding to bases on double play attempts reads:</p>

<p>""If the umpire determines that the runner violated this Rule 6.01(j), the umpire shall declare both the runner and batter-runner out. Note, however, that if the runner has already been put out then the runner on whom the defense was attempting to make a play shall be declared out.""</p>

<p>I'm asking the meaning as to the last sentence (the ""note, however"" part). Does it, in rare cases, make another runner out in place of the batter-runner? I just don't understand it. I'll elaborate.</p>

<p>Does it concern, say, an offensive player sliding into third base who interferes with the fielder after being put out, with that fielder's subsequent throw going to second base to attempt to force out a runner going there? Is the player running toward second base out, instead of the batter-runner, since this was ""the runner on whom the defense was attempting to make a play"" on? Assume that the bases are loaded and the double play attempt is a put out at third followed by a throw to second, rather than your standard DP. Am I in the right ballpark, so to speak? This example isn't great, but it's nearly 2am here and it was the best I could do.</p>

<p>I understand the application of this rule mainly concerns cut and dry double play attempts at second, where the runner who was at first crashes into the shortstop or second baseman in order to break up the throw to first that would put out the batter-runner. But does that last sentence of the rule in some cases exempt the batter-runner from being automatically out, like in the case I presented above? Or is the batter-runner always out? Any help would be most welcome. Thanks guys. I'm thinking I'm right, but I could just as easily be misunderstanding the wording. I've only recently become interested in the rules and just want to understand them fully.</p>

"Achieving the optimal strike in squash: Is the wrist involved at all?","<p>I am a sports enthusiast who has tried out many ball sports through-out my life with years of training in football (read: ""soccer"" if you are American) and basketball, as well as many hours of experience/play time in tennis and table tennis, although no formal training. </p>

<p>Several years back I decided to give a shot to squash with a friend, both never even watched a game at that point. By reading and watching and asking, I got to a level where I think I know the basics of the game. Since I am familiar with ball sports, I don't find it hard to follow the ball or use the walls/bounces to my best advantage. However I don't think I have the best technique.</p>

<p>So, the question; when I watch videos of pros or the people who compete in my town, I realize that they use the wrist to create a whip effect, or at least that's my interpretation of it. I believe I tend to be more stale in an effort to keep the racket in balance when striking the ball. I am not sure if I'd be able to deliver much power if ended up hitting the ball with a wrist-powered shot, compared to a whole-arm strike which puts much of the strain on the shoulders and the chest. Am I doing something wrong? Is it common practice to use the wrist in squash? Could it be so that my racket is simply too heavy for me (alt. I am not strong enough in my wrist to deliver proper shots with my racket?)</p>

<li>The referee validates the goal</li>
<li>The scorer admits (before restarting game) to referee they committed a foul before scoring</li>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Massimiliano Allegri’s men were in the ascendancy, and should have been 2-0 up after 25 minutes, but for a controversial incident which saw a legitimate goal not given.</p>
  
  <p>Buffon initially did well to parry a header by Philippe Mexes from a corner, but hooked out Sulley Muntari’s rebound with the ball clearly over the line, sparking Milan celebrations. However, referee Paolo Tagliavento did not signal, and play continued.</p>

<p>After the game, Buffon declared that he didn't notice the goal, but even if he had noticed it he <strong>wouldn't have admitted to the referee</strong>. </p>

"What's the justification for this rarely-invoked NFL fumble rule?","<p>Yesterday, at the end of the Packers-Bills game (2014 Week 15), Rodgers fumbled into his own endzone. Eddie Lacy recovered it, but was unable to fight his way out, resulting in a game-winning safety.</p>

<p>The TV coverage pointed out an interesting wrinkle: even if he had made it out, it still would have been considered a safety, due to this section of <a href=""http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/fumble"">the NFL's fumble rule</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If any player fumbles after the two-minute warning in a half, only the
  fumbling player is permitted to recover and/or advance the ball. If
  recovered by any other offensive player, the ball is dead at the spot
  of the fumble unless it is recovered behind the spot of the fumble. In
  that case, the ball is dead at the spot of recovery. Any defensive
  player may recover and/or advance any fumble at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to be little-known enough that Lacy himself didn't know it, since his recovery of the ball was what ended the play and sealed the game. Only Rodgers could have run it out of the endzone to avoid the loss. Of course, in the actual game, the outcome was inevitable, because Rodgers had no idea where the ball was.</p>

<p>My guess is that this rule exists to discourage ""intentional fumbling"" in desperate situations. Is that right? Does anyone know when it was added, and whether the league ever had an ""intentional fumbling"" problem?</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/NFL_Stats/status/546739886670483456"" rel=""nofollow"">NFL_Stats twitter account</a>, the Chiefs haven't had a WR catch a TD pass since December 8, 2013:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The #Chiefs have not had a WR catch a TD pass since December 8th, 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is 17 straight regular season games without a WR catching a TD pass (the Chiefs did have a WR catch a TD pass in their playoff game last season).  A <a href=""http://www.steelers.com/news/countdown-to-kickoff/article-1/Countdown-Steelers-vs-Chiefs/cca59ceb-f5d0-4a6e-bdd9-e146a460e0b4"" rel=""nofollow"">December 19 article</a> on Steelers.com confirms this:</p>

"What is a ""football move"" in the NFL?","<p>It happens a lot: a receiver catches the ball, drops it, it is called a fumble on the field. Then there is some expert commentator giving his opinion on whether the receiver made a 'football move' after catching the ball.</p>

<p>It came up with Texans v Colts this year. Johnson's drop was called a fumble, a talking head confidently stated it would be reversed because Johnson clearly didn't have possession and make a football move. It was not reversed. This happens a lot.</p>

<p>Is this term 'football move' defined anywhere in the rule book? Are there explicit criteria to be applied? I looked in the online version and didn't find anything:</p>

"60-year old dad passes out after 1/2 an hour of badminton","<p>My dad is 60 years old. I have never played any kind of sports for 30 years. 
However, he's working with geography and sometimes (maybe a week per month) he has to hike in the jungle as a part of his job.</p>

<p>Recently, a heart doctor prescribed medication for him. He now takes a heart pill every morning.  </p>

<p>Today, he told me he wants to play badminton with me. This is the 1st time he played sports. So we played for 30 minutes. Then suddenly he felt tired and he sat down. Then, right at that time, I saw he fell asleep. I tried to call him but he didn't wake up. So I rushed out and call an ambulance, but my dad suddenly woke up.</p>

<p>He just passed out for 5 minutes. He told me that his doctor said he should do the walking exercise only.</p>

"Pitchers as MVP","<p>Many argued, especially after Clayton Kershaw's amazing run this year that got him the NL MVP award, that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP award as they don't even play most of the games. Here's the Wikipedia description of the award: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very descriptive -- one outstanding player? I'm finding trouble finding a more official definition of the way the winner of this award is determined and the two competing points of view on the pitcher-as-MVP theory. As a Kershaw fan, I find it hard to accept that pitchers should be ineligible for this award, but I'd like to know where this is heading, if anywhere. Are the members of the BBWAA contemplating about this and does such a change seem probable in the near future? </p>

"Declining a delay-of-game penalty: what about an infinite loop?","<p>I was watching the Outback Bowl today when one team decided to punt from around its opponents 35 yard line. The coach decided to let the play clock expire to get a little extra room to kick after the penalty, and the commentators speculated that the coach on the defense might opt to decline the penalty, hoping to increase the likelihood of a punt into the endzone. The penalty was accepted.</p>

<p>Makes sense to me. But suppose a team takes a delay of game penalty and the defense declines the penalty. The play clock runs down again for another delay of game, which is again declined. Ad nauseum.</p>

<p>Is this even possible (forget likelihood)? If so, how would the referees get the game moving again?</p>

"On an onside kick, what happens when a return man signals fair catch and is obstructed from reaching the ball?","<p>Team A is still down by two points with less than one minute remaining in the game and they are kicking off to team B after just scoring a touchdown. Team B realizes they are going to try an onside kick and at last minute brings their return man up right behind their first line of defense-men. As team A is kicking the ball, the return man raises his hand for a fair catch in accordance with Rule 10. As the ball is kicked sideways and the return man runs toward it, he is blocked both by his own men and players from the other team from reaching the ball. </p>

<p>And the question:  Would this be legal under the rules? Would the ref call some type of foul on either team? Is the return man entitled to a clear path to the ball under this scenario? And if not, please cite the rule.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I'm intrigued by Michael's response; but not yet quite satisfied. Let's add another facet to the scenario. Let's say the wind is blowing hard when Team A is kicking off and they can't keep the ball on the tee and they opt to drop kick the ball as provided in the rules. So has the ball touched the ground and now the kick off receiver can't call a fair catch no matter where he is standing? And if that is the case; wouldn't be better for every team to drop kick the ball so they could run down and tackle the opposing return man?</p>

"Why do most coaches save key defensive resources till the end of the game?","<p>This question could be asked of a number of sports, but the example I'm using comes from football.</p>

<p>Yesterday, during the wild card round, the New Orleans Saints called a time out early in the second quarter, to give their defense a chance to recuperate, after the Philadelphia Eagles had driven to the ""red zone.""</p>

<p>The results fully justified the move. The next two plays resulted in defensive sacks for long yards that prevented a touchdown, and drove the Eagles to the edge of field goal range. The Eagles kicked and missed a field goal that might have represented a victory had the made it (the final score was 26-24, Saints).</p>

<p>Apparently this is unusual. Why is that?  My understanding is that most coaches like to save key defensive resources (e.g. time outs in football, or closers in baseball) for the end of the game. Are some coaches now starting to move their key resources at ""critical times"" (e.g. time outs earlier in the game)?</p>

<p>Is this allowed in all careers, and we just don't care about most?  </p>

<p>Even so, it still seems that athletes are subject to a ridiculous level of scrutiny.  This isn't some new thing either - there are even quizzes you can take about the highest paid baseball players ( here is one of many ) <a href=""http://www.sporcle.com/games/Scizzy/high_paid"">on Sporcle</a>.  </p>

But I've never heard anyone complain about it other than the occasional groans by the players ( groans that are summarily mocked and dismissed by the media ).</p>

"When/how did US professional wrestling transition from being competitive to being worked?","<p>As I understand it, professional wrestling was initially a legitimate sport. Up until around 1920, the matches were mostly competitive (though there was a healthy dose of match fixing even then.) These matches were being promoted and sanctioned by some independent sporting organization (I know there were athletic clubs in New York, LA, and Boston for example), as well as national groups like the National Boxing  Association and it's spin-off National Wrestling Association. </p>

<p>By 1938 and the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance, the sport has become entirely worked (barring the occasional unplanned double-cross), with outcomes and title changes being predetermined and key parts of matches scripted ahead of time. These matches were promoted by privately owned regional wrestling promotions (under what was called the territory system.)</p>

<p>What I'm not really clear on is how that transition happened. When did it begin, and how did the promoters in the athletics organizations convince the wrestlers -- and each other -- to go along with the staged matches? Did this transition happen all at once, or was there a long stretch of time where some titles were being contended legitimately, while others were entirely predetermined?</p>

<p>I doubt the reason is of the shot angle or the precision.  Furthermore, I consider this shot as ""less safe"" against fails, because of the unstable foot positioning. (<a href=""https://youtu.be/e64P98YFnAs?t=687"" rel=""nofollow"">fail example</a>)
Initially I was thinking the shooting foot remains the same, but i was wrong - but still I'm wondering if that's really the argument for that kind of shooting?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I don't know if that technique has a particular ""name"", e.g. like the ""elastico"" trick, therefore I don't know a better title for my question.</p>

"training and scoring of free throws in basketball","<p>In soccer, many coaches believe that it is impossible to train penalty shots, based on the argument that the pressure that is on a player who takes a penalty shot can not be simulated during training.</p>

<p>Essentially, there is little difference with free throws in basketball: the distance is always the same, the spectators expect the player to score.</p>

<p>My questions: do basketball players actively train for their free throws? How do they simulate the pressure on the player? What is the scoring percentage for free throws among the best teams? In soccer, the better players score 80 percent or higher.</p>

"Tag out of a forced runner to end the inning, does the run still score?","<p>Bases loaded with 2 outs, ground ball hit towards 3B/SS hole fielded by 3B. The third-basemen elects to try and tag the runner advancing from 2nd to 3rd, but the runner sees the decision and stops running (while staying inside the legal base path) forcing the 3B to continue chasing him to apply the tag. Meanwhile the runner at 3rd base was blazing home and crossed the plate decisively before the 3rd out was made by a tag.  Umpire calls the runner safe at home because the 3rd out was not made by a FORCE out but instead a TAG out....  We realize that this 3rd basemen had a mental lapse as a force play is much easier even he has to go to second with it instead of touching 3rd.... </p>

<p>I came up with another scenario which I think might happen more commonly in MLB, hopefully making it easier to find a record of this being called by a MLB umpire....</p>

<p>Bases loaded with one out, ground ball hit to SS, the short-stop fields clean and tosses it to the Second-basemen covering second who touches the base and throws on to first to complete the double play. The throw from the second-basemen is off the mark causing the first-basemen to come down the line toward home, he scoops it up and tags the runner for the 3rd out. However, the runner from third easily scored prior to the TAG being applied the batter/runner forced to first base.
EDIT - In this case the batter/runner did not reach first safely so the run does not count according to According to MLB rules: 4.09 HOW A TEAM SCORES.</p>

<p>(a) One run shall be scored each time a runner legally advances to and touches first, second, third and home base before three men are put out to end the inning. EXCEPTION: A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made (1) by the batter-runner before he touches first base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner who is declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases.</p>

<p>However, I still can't find any specific wording in MLB rule book that states a <strong>tag applied to a forced runner still counts as a FORCE-OUT</strong>.  Can anyone verify this claim?? </p>

"Offensive interference in baseball (""confusing"" a fielder)","<p>The Umpire Bible website presents an interference scenario that is brought up under the base runner ""confusing"" an infielder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can think up lots of scenarios. For example, let's say there's one out and a runner on first (R1). Batter hits a weak grounder to the shortstop. Easy double-play, right? Well, on sliding into second, R1 shouts ""that's three outs,"" and the second baseman pulls up, drops the ball and starts heading for the dugout. Well, you might say the second baseman (F4) is a moron for not knowing his situation and falling for the trick (and you'd be right). That said, it's still interference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand what's being said by this, but does this situation call for the batter-runner to be out, making for a double play, rather than putting out the base runner committing the act (since it seems like he's already been forced out, per the description of the play)?</p>

<p>Under OBR, it says that a batter's legal position in the box while addressing the pitcher is when both feet are within the lines of the box (the lines themselves being part of the box). So, simply, prior to hitting the pitch, this means the batter cannot even have a toe outside the white chalk lines, correct? I read on some shady site that you just need your foot touching the lines, meaning you can have your toes at least partially outside the lines. However, all other evidence seems to be the contrary. So, must the batter have both feet entirely within the lines, no toes/heels, etc outside the lines? I realize he's able to have a toe outside the line when actually hitting the ball, by the way.</p>

"(un)restricted free agency in NHL","<p>I am trying to understand free agency rules in NHL, how the last two lockouts changed them, and how players may decide to behave with respect to them.</p>

<p>My understanding is that after the 2004-5 lockout, unrestricted free agents became those players how are either older than 27 or have at least 7 seasons of tenure in NHL. The shift to the new rules was gradual: before season 2004-5, it was 31 years of age without tenure requirements (is this correct?); then--after the lockout, in 2005-6 it became 29 years of age or with 7 seasons tenure; finally, in 2006-7 it became 27 or with 7 seasons of tenure.</p>

<p>After the 2004-5 lockout, younger players with less than 7 seasons of tenure remained restricted free agents at the end of the contract, if the current team offered them a qualifying contract (i.e. a contract of at least 1 season, with a salary that is equivalent to at least 100-110% of the last salary). Differently, without the offer of a qualifying contract from the current team, these players become unrestricted free agents.</p>

<p>The 2012-2013 lockout did not lead to any change in this free agency rules.</p>

<p><strong>My question is based on the assumption that the above illustration is correct (if it is wrong, please, tell me what detail is wrong) and is grounded on a story telling that differs from the usual one--see below.</strong></p>

<p>Many hockey fan claim that long contracts impact players performance. After a player signs a multi-year contract, in the first season he ""shrinks"" (i.e. he does not play at his best), then he plays a bit better in the following seasons, and finally (in the last season of the contract) he plays as well as he could to convince the team owner (or the owner of another team) that he deserves a new contract.</p>

<p><strong>I think that this story is incomplete because it does not differentiate between players who qualify as restricted free agents and those who qualify as unrestricted free agents.</strong> 
Let's consider a young good and nontenured player, in the last season of his contract. Since he is good, he expects the team owner to offer him a contract renewal that would be considered as a qualifying offer; therefore, he does not expect to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the contract. 
However, during the last season (or even a bit earlier), a different team owner comes forth and holds private talks with this player; this new team is better than his current team and wants to offer to him a better contract (much more money).</p>

<p><strong>The question is: how likely is that this player intentionally plays bad during his last season in order to convince his current team owner to not give him a qualifying offer? Without qualifying offer, he becomes unrestricted free agent and can freely join the better team which offers him more money.</strong>
What do you think? Is it likely to happen? 
Are there some rumors about this behavior?</p>

"Why does the game stop after the kicking team catches a punt?","<p>I am a occasional football watcher from Europe, so please excuse my stupid question.</p>

<p>My question is the following: The standard outcome of a punt is a catch by the defending team and some running before he goes down or out of bounds. Sometimes, however, a member of the punting team happens to catch the punt, in which case the defending team gets possession where the catch happened. I don't really understand why the play does not continue in this case. What does such a catch distinguish to a 'normal catch'? I have the following thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kicking forward is generally allowed and could theoretically be done in 'normal play'. [EDIT: This assumption turned out to be wrong.]</li>
<li>Sometimes, kick-offs are done in a manner to maintain possession (I guess this is called on-side kick?). If it's allowed in this case to catch the ball, why not after a punt?  </li>
<li>Kicking the ball wide forward (and usually giving up possession) is often seen in Rugby as a means to open up the game. If a member of the kicking team gains possession, the game just goes on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on my understanding, I'd hence assume the kicking team would at least be granted a new first down. I don't see a reason why the possession would change in this case.</p>

"Why are Indian news TV channels not showing coverage of cricket matches?","<p>During earlier IPL events, all Indian news TV channels were giving highlights, point tables, etc. We were getting too many updates.  </p>

<p>During IPL 2018, there was no coverage in prime time on any Indian news TV channels. Even the England tour was not shown. Now Asia Cup is not shown. No updates on cricket, except for a line or two. Even the India-Pakistan match was not highlighted!  </p>

<p>The Asian Games were shown prominently, but not cricket. Are TV news channels boycotting cricket? Or are sports telecasters demanding too much money from TV news channels?  </p>

<p>Even the matches between India and West Indies is not shown prominently. On Day 1, there was prime time news only about the century scored by Prithvi Shaw and no other player was mentioned. Maybe broadcasters have taken very exclusive rights and want viewers to watch sports channels for cricket news.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
On 21/Nov/2018, morning, there was some news about India preparing for the t20 matches, and players were shown practicing; Not sure if that is stock video or current coverage.<br>
Evening, there were only few lines about India losing by 4 runs due to DLS. No video of the match, no news about wickets, partnerships, Australia score, top scorers  ....  </p>

<p>Possible Answer:<br>
Pattern looks like news channels want to cover it, but they are not getting the live video; Maybe the charges are too high or the owners of the video want viewers to watch it through sports channels only.</p>

"How is spike speed measured in volleyball?","<p>I've been eyeballing a volleyball match right now (apparently, it's world championships :), and have noticed that they show ""spike speed"" for spike replays. How is that speed measured? Is the ball stuffed with sensors or is there an array of hi-speed cameras to measure this? How much instrumentation is there for a high-profile match like this?</p>

<p>The main judge has three displays at his disposals, they look like three completely different things. At at least two times teams have contested a ruling, and a rudimentary 3D animation was shown on stream. It looked bit low-res, and definitely not like something the studio responsible for the transmission would do - so it must have originated from some kind of match-local instrumentation.</p>

The Swedish TV commentator then made a comment about one of the high jumpers, that he almost jumped with both feet. The jumper clearly jumped with one foot, but I guess that by just changing his technique a bit he would jump with both feet. The height of his jump was somewhere around 2.30 metres. I would find it surprising if a two-feet jump would be significantly lower than that.</p>

"What happens when a baseball player is ""DFA'ed"" and then signs with another team?","<p>I'm asking specifically about <a href=""http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pablo Sandoval</a>, who signed a five year contract with Boston Red Sox, and is now owed $18 million each for 2018 and 2019, plus the balance of his 2017 salary. He was designated for assignment because 1) he had become a ""replacement"" player, and 2) he was being paid way too much for a level of performance that a ""minimum wage"" player called up from the minors could match or exceed.</p>

<p>The San Francisco Giants may now want Sandoval back, perhaps on a ""trial"" basis. Will they have to pick up his expensive contract to rehire him? Can they pay him what they think he's worth and have Boston pick up the difference? Or can they pick up the full contract and dump it back on Boston if they DFA Sandoval themselves?</p>

<p>Have others in the past elected to play again when (in Sandoval's case) they could collect over $40 million (or some lower amount) over several years while not playing?</p>

<p>What has happened in these types of situations?</p>

"If two pitchers pitch to the same batter, who is credited with the result of the at-bat?","<p>Let us assume a hypothetical situation in an MLB game. A pitcher gets to a 2-2 count against the batter. Then the pitcher leaves the game - perhaps he sustains an injury while delivering a pitch, or is ejected by an umpire. In this case, the offense is allowed to substitute a new pitcher during the at-bat because the old pitcher left due to injury or ejection.</p>

<p>Which pitcher is credited with the result of the at-bat? Does it matter what the count is? Clearly if the batter hits a home run that is the responsibility of the new pitcher, but if the batter walks after going 3-0, would the new pitcher be credited with the walk after the first pitcher put him in the hole? Same with 0-2 and getting a strikeout.</p>

<p>What do the official MLB rules say about this? Section 5.10 covers substitutions including some pitcher-specific rules, but I cannot find anything about during an at-bat. Section 9.16 is pretty thorough with regards to swapping pitchers between batters in ERA calculations, but I have been unable to find anything about pitching statistics where a single batter faces two pitchers during a single at-bat.</p>

In some cases, (for example with the MLS and the CONCACAF Gold Cup) there isn't even a break in the schedule but most players compete for their countries rather then their teams anyways.   </p>

<p>Example: Person A serves first on side 1. They keep on playing. Say A wins the set 6-3. A served in the last set on side 1. In th next set, do they swap sides and Person B serves on side 1 or does A serve again on side 1 like the start the first set?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's the first option but when I play some people say you spin the racket again or start again like a new set. When they do it my way, they get confused when to swap sides because the rely on the number of games played, and they don't count the first set.</p>

"Hitter reaching first although he is already out","<p>Something that I  noticed happening in almost every game  is the following: The hitter grounds out and the defense has an easy out on  first.

Yet he continuous to jog to first, he steps on it and then he retires. </p>

<p>Why does he continue to run, although he is out? Does it have any effect on statistics whether the runner made it to first or not?

"What is the percentage of game won in alternating penalties format for team going first?","<p>What is the percentage of game won in current format of alternating penalties for team going first in top European football competitions?</p>

<p>Main reason for asking this question is ABBA system for penalty shootout. Which was recently used in FA Community Shield match between Chelsea and Arsenal. In this system, the order of penalties would see the the team going first in the shootout taking one spot-kick before their opponents take two in succession. <a href=""https://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=2463576.html?rss=2463576+Penalty+shoot-out+trial+at+UEFA+final+tournaments"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Trial system for penalties)</a></p>

<p>The reason for this new system is, to reduce the potential advantage that the team taking a first penalty in a shootout have. IFAB says that the experiment follows growing evidence that the current penalty shoot-out system, as laid down in the Laws of the Game to determine the outcome of a match, gives an unfair advantage to the team taking the first penalty in each pair of spot kicks.</p>

<p>Study of Mr. Ignacio Palacios-Huerta, Professor, London School of Economics, shows that new <a href=""https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2017/08/take-chance-me"" rel=""noreferrer"">ABBA format cuts down advantage to 54%</a>.

"In Golf, can you choose to play down the 'wrong' fairway?","<p>I am an occasional (and fairly terrible) golfer. I played a round the other day and was confronted with an odd situation. I sliced a ball through some trees and onto the adjacent fairway. I still had 200-250 metres left to the pin after this shot. When I got to my ball, I noted that the trees between me and hole or the fairway of the hole I was playing were thick and high, whereas about 150 closer to the hole, the trees really thinned out. I therefore played a shot up the 'wrong' fairway to a position where I could relatively easily chip to the green through the sparse area of trees.</p>

<p>This was a social game, so I wasn't too worried, but was what I did legal under the Laws of Golf? Is there any compulsion to play along the 'correct' fairway when possible? Also, aside from any letter of the law considerations, what etiquette issues might doing this present?  </p>

He could have gone anywhere, but he chose to re-sign with the Cavs so that they could trade him to the Heat and get draft picks in return.

"Any historical sports with instant-win moves?","<p>I was recently watching Harry Potter (because I'm super-cool), and it occurred to me: has there ever been a sport that had something akin to catching the snitch in Quidditch, where the game immediately ends in victory, regardless of how long you've been playing or how well you've been doing?</p>

<p>All sports I can think of generally end after a certain period of time (e.g. basketball), a certain number of turns (e.g. innings in baseball), or a certain number of milestones (e.g. holes in golf).  With all of them, though, victory is the result of earning points as you go, so the winner can be predicted with increasing certainty as the session progresses.  There may be a 9th-inning rally, but even if you turn it around in the last 2 minutes, you still have to close the distance and eventually overtake your opponent's score before you win.</p>

<p>Non-physical games often have instant-win conditions (e.g. checkmate in chess) where you could be doing horribly and then instantly be the winner, but are there any (or have there been any in history) physical sports that have similar potential?  I seem to recall that the ball game of the Aztecs had something like this, but the accounts I'm finding online seem to disagree with each other.</p>

<p>I was reading about the rebuilding process by the Boston Celtics, which seems to be centered around getting draft picks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the meantime, Ainge has been doing a great job accumulating future
  draft picks, and that can only help accelerate the restocking of his
  roster. When Ainge traded Jordan Crawford and former Net MarShon
  Brooks to Golden State this past week in a three-way deal with the
  Heat, the Celtics picked up two more draft picks. Between Ainge’s
  deals with the Nets and Clippers and other moves, the Celtics now have
  <strong>17 potential draft picks over the next five seasons</strong>. Some will be used
  for their drafts, but others are likely to be included as sweeteners
  in deals for established players.</p>

<p>My question is: how important is it to accumulate draft picks in a rebuilding effort compared to any other available strategies? And are there examples of teams that have built competitive teams without giving up important players? For example, I would think the San Antonio Spurs as an example of a team that has had competitive teams without going through a rebuilding phase in many years.</p>

"Why does a basketball ref raise the second arm when a 3-pt shot falls?","<p>When a basketball player shoots a 3-point shot, I've noticed that a referee will raise one arm straight over his head while the ball is in the air. This presumably signals to everyone that the shot is, indeed, a 3-pointer and not a 2-pointer. </p>

<p>But why does the ref always raise the other arm straight overhead when the shot goes in? There's clearly no need to give any indication that the shot actually was good - <em>everyone</em> knows that. The player who shot the ball knows it, the other team knows it, the other refs know it...<em>everyone</em>. </p>

<p>As an additional curiosity, they don't do that when a player makes a 2-point shot or a free throw. So why that extra (and seemingly useless) arm motion for a made 3-point shot?</p>

<p>FIBA says
<a href=""http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/official-basketball-rules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/official-basketball-rules.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Art. 24 Dribbling
  24.1 Definition</p>
  
  <p>24.1.1 A dribble is the movement of a live ball caused by a player in control of that ball who throws, taps, rolls or bounces the ball on
  the floor.</p>
  
  <p>24.1.2 A dribble starts when a player, having gained control of a live ball on the playing court throws, taps, rolls or bounces it on the
  floor and touches it again before it touches another player.</p>
  
  <p>A dribble ends when the player touches the ball with both hands
  simultaneously or permits the ball to come to rest in one or both
  hands. During a dribble the ball may be thrown into the air provided
  the ball touches the floor or another player before the player who
  threw it touches it again with his hand. There is no limit to the
  number of steps a player may take when the ball is not in contact with
  his hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and about Double Dribble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24.2 Rule A player shall not dribble for a second time after his first dribble has ended unless between the 2 dribbles he has lost control of
  a live ball on the playing court because of: • A shot for a field
  goal. • A touch of the ball by an opponent. • A pass or fumble that
  has touched or been touched by another player.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading the definitions above, it seems to me that when the ball is rolling on the floor (without bouncing) the dribble has not ended, therefore it wouldn't be double dribble to tap it and get it bouncing again</p>

I know that the best 16 teams from World Cup that didn't qualified by the World Cup, will participate in these wild card tournaments. Now, things get a little bit more unclear, because of the following picture:</p>

<p>I know that switch-hit batters are allowed to switch to the other side of home-plate at anytime before the pitcher is ready to pitch, but can the pitcher do the same?</p>

<p>Some pitchers like Billy Wagner had custom gloves made that had 6 finger slots so that he was able to use the glove on both hands at any given time, but when he pitched in games it was either left or right and not both.  Also, Billy could throw over 90 mph with both arms.  I mean if you have that god given ability why worry about changing your arm slot to try and trick the batter's view when you could just throw with the other arm?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32204840"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">But Gabon are the hosts of AfCON 2017</a>, so they get automatic qualification.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoko.org/2016/03/30/sierra-leone-sports-sierra-leone-defeat-gabon-narrowly/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I read on a Sierra Leone news site that points against Gabon don't count</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The match was part of the 2017 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) group I qualifying schedule but didn’t count towards qualification as Gabon are hosting the finals in January</p>

"In recent IPL T20 cricket matches, are the commentators in the stadium or watching a broadcast in a studio?","<p>I have been watching cricket on tv for years and have occasionally seen the commentary box. Usually, the camera will be behind the commentators and the image will show the commentators watching the match from a small room, and the players will also be visible. There may be a change of commentators (somebody moving in and somebody moving out) and even then, we could see the field. More-over, commentators will be talking about events which are not visible to tv viewers, meaning it is happening outside the range of the camera.<br>
This type of video ""proves"" that the commentators are in the commentary box.<br>
Here are 2 views of general ""proper"" commentary boxes:<br>

Surely, these commentators are in the stadium.</p>

<p>Now-a-days (atleast in T20 WC matches or IPL Matches) I feel that the commentators are not in the box, but are watching a broadcast stream in some studio.<br>

It is not really clear if they are in the stadium or in a small studio, pretending to be watching the match live at the stadium.<br>
The last picture is especially suspicious, because it looks like the camera will be blocking the view of the match.</p>

<p>My Doubt is based on 2 main points:<br>
<strong>(1)</strong> The commentators (and the change of commentators) will always shown from the front, and there will never be a view of the commentators with the field or players in view.<br>
<strong>(2)</strong> The commentators seem to say exactly what is shown on the screen and seem to be clueless of the ground situation.<br>
<strong>Eg 2A</strong> : On the tv, a ball going towards the boundary may look like it will cross it, while the commentators should be able to see a fielder running towards it. I have seen cases where the commentator was saying something like ""going to be a four [that is what we can see] ... no, a fielder gets to it at the last moment [that is when the tv shows the fielder]"", which I can make out without the redundant commentary.<br>
<strong>Eg 2B</strong> : A ball hit too high may look like a six on tv, and even the commentator will claim that it is going to be a six, but eventually we see that it has simply gone up and come down on the wicketkeeper, who takes an easy catch.<br>
After noticing this couple of years back, I have been waiting for similar comments in latest matches, but I think they have become clever and do not comment on these things now ; they wait for the tv to show what is happening and then they say what we can already see.</p>

<p>Beyond these two main points, I noticed two other minor points:<br>
<strong>(3)</strong> I noticed that occasionally there is the light from tv screen on the faces on the commentators.<br>
<strong>(4)</strong> I also noticed that commentators do not say anything which is not shown on the tv, Eg If umpire has asked for 3RD umpire Decision, but the tv has not shown him asking for it, then commentators too will be talking about other things, like ""boy-o-boy, at a time like this, a huge risk in trying to take a single [replay shows umpire asking for 3RD umpire Decision] and what will it be ? Out or not out ?"", where basically, they are trying to hide the fact that they are clueless until the tv shows what is happening.</p>

<p>We have English Commentary Broadcast (claimed implicitly to be from stadium) and Hindi Commentary Broadcast (known to be from studio) and both are similar, making me suspect that even the English Broadcast is from the studio.</p>

<p><strong>In recent IPL T20 cricket matches, are the commentators in the stadium or watching a broadcast in some studio ?</strong></p>

<p>I am not claiming that all commentaries are from studio, I am only saying that in some matches (especially T20 IPL) the studio is used, without informing the audience, but then they never explicitly claimed to be in the stadium, so they are not really lying.<br>
It may be that the studio is easier for bringing in Film Stars who do not want to get stuck in the huge crowds or traffic generated by IPL. It may be that commentary boxes are used as VIP seats, and commentators are asked to move out.</p>

  <p>In the early days of baseball, it was considered unmanly to use a glove. Broken bones were common. The first mass-produced gloves had little padding and no fingers. In the 1920s and ’30s, companies started producing gloves with a web between the thumb and forefinger, to create a pocket.</p>

<p>So, he is defending 10+90 points from last year. Last year Diego Schwartzman got knocked out in the first round and did not have to come through qualifying so should have gotten 10 points surely?

<p>He is the only player listed like this (everyone else has 10 as their minimum ranking points) and I can't figure out where the 90 and 45 points come from.</p>

"Coaching a (low-interest) collegiate fencing club","<p>I am the assistant volunteer coach for a collegiate fencing club.  The coach is keen on teaching fencing fundamentals and some advanced maneuvers.  I am his second set of eyes and goto for general fitness, for example, introducing new routines for warmups and conditioning.</p>

<p>We were/are working toward putting fencing back on the map at our university (about 20 core members in 2006, 4 in 2012). Last school year, we started from scratch, but we started out with good interest. As the year progressed, interest dropped and ""storms"" came. For next year (as it currently stands), we have about two chief members of the club.</p>

<p>During winter break last school year, we were brainstorming how to collect more interest. Two things that came up were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The coach being too hard on the ""casual"" members.</li>
<li>Lack of diversity within the club.....as in, each member had interest in rpg, magic the gathering, sword fighting, etc and held rpg gatherings twice a week. I would like to see a diverse team stay involved, feel included, and help one another out.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combat coach being too hard, we ""cupcaked"" our drills, and that proved to be a huge mistake. We also made an attempt to include others interested in fencing without an outside interest in rpgs and such (this didn't work either...I can hang out with anybody, but this was overkill).  On top of all that, all the PR material I made had to be changed when the club president didn't reserve our usual spot for the semester (as volunteers, coach and I have no administrative say over this). That took the wind out of our sails and started a rough semester. At least we closed out the semester well, gathering interest and praise at a local children's festival. </p>

<p>As we brainstorm, I have a general plan of attack as we approach the upcoming year. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A monthly newsletter for our e-mail list.</li>
<li>PR (flyers, brochures, etc.) fresh and hot out of the oven when the school year starts. Perhaps reserving a table in a common area to gather interest and spread the word.</li>
<li>An interest meeting for new/returning members to see how involved they want to get (casual or competitive) before the annual club fair</li>
<li>Keep our baggage at the door. This was an issue to a greater extent two years ago, but I believe this also applies to the ""lack of diversity"" within the club. I would like to see a diversified team, rather than a copy of the same person across the board.</li>
<li>Keep a challenging workout. We don't ever push people beyond what they can bear, but we also motivate and encourage progress as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know individuals without lack of motivation is beyond our control, but we also want to properly deal with individuals who carry dead weight. For example, one of our chief members started out as a difficult case last year, but she eventually became one of the hardest working members of the club by the end of the year. A former chief member who felt overwhelmed with tasks pointed the finger at others and didn't do much herself, and she eventually quit.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who can share his/her strategy for our situation? The main points I'm asking advice for is <strong>team diversity/chemistry</strong> and <strong>maintaing interest</strong> while executing challenging routines/drills to encourage progress. PR is one thing, but how do we gather and maintain a core group of individuals to coach?</p>

"HEMA Longsword Compasses","<p>I am a novice swordsman, learning Italian Longsword from Guy Windsor's <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9526793404"" rel=""nofollow"">The Swordsman's Companion</a></em>, which so far has been a very helpful and instructive book. I have a question concerning the <em>Mulinello</em> (Windmill, or Compass) exercise, as the pictures and wording only explain so much.</p>

<p>When <em>Mulinello</em> are done in reverse, you end up in something like <em>Posta Longa</em> (Long Position) or <em>Posta Finestra</em> (Window Position), but with your false edge up. The golden rule for guards is to go from a guard to a guard. <strong>Given this, how do you from your awkward ""post-reverse-Mulinello"" stance to a proper one?</strong> (As a bonus question: would this situation come up in sparring without you being totally exposed?)</p>

<p>After some experimentation, I have found some solutions, but I do not trust my opinion as a novice. They are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simply twist your wrists around into <em>Posta Longa</em> or <em>Posta Breve</em></li>
<li>Perform another <em>Mulinello</em> to get to <em>Posta Longa</em></li>
<li>Go into <em>Posta Finestra</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be noted that I am looking for an answer from a someone with Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) background. I would make the HEMA tag, but I don't have the requisite reputation here yet.</p>

"Why don't basketballers take more long shots?","<p>Lately, I ran into a discussion about how basketballers barely take long shots and are often looking to break through for dunking. I'm from the Netherlands, and there is this sport called ""korfball"" which is pretty similar to basketball. The word ""korf"" translates to something which is pretty similar to a basket.</p>

<p>In korfball, you're not allowed to walk when you're in possession of the ball, which results in having to pass the ball around at a very high rate to be able to break through.  The defending team tries to find a balance between holding back (preventing break throughs) and blocking shots.</p>

<p>More important, korfballers do not care too much about not being able to break through, as (at a high level) their accuracy is crazy and they score the vast majority of their long shots. Their accuracy pushes defenders to give away less space, which opens up possibilities for breaking through.</p>

<p>Here is a video to get a feel of their typical accuracy:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygoIb7EXWnY&amp;t=2m35s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygoIb7EXWnY&amp;t=2m35s</a></p>

<p>My question is as follows: why don't basketballers simply take the ""long"" shot as soon as they approach the three-point line? At that distance, they are rarely so strongly defended that their shots would get blocked. I often see attempts of players trying to break through, aborting mission and taking the shot from a closer (and strongly destabilised) position. Why not take your time and shoot from a couple of meters back? Korfballers shoot (and score) from much greater distances all the time.</p>

<p>Even more, assuming that basketballers can have an equal accuracy, scoring from the three-point line will push the defenders forward, creating more space for their beloved dunks. </p>

<p>Some data to support my question:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A basketball weights 650 gram, whereas a korfbal weighs about 500 grams. A neglectable difference, if you ask me.</p></li>
<li><p>Radius of a korfbal, korfbal ""basket"" and their ratio (the lower, the more difficult): 11 cm, 15 cm, 1.36</p></li>
<li><p>Radius of a basketball, radius of the hoop and their ratio (the lower, the more difficult): 12.5 cm, 22.8 cm, 1.82</p></li>
<li><p>The basketball net is at a height of 3 meter, whereas a korfbal ""basket"" is at a height of 3.5 meter. </p></li>
<li><p>The 3-pointer line is at a distance of 6.75 meter, whereas korfbal players regularly take shots in the range of 15-10 meter</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, there is a board behind the basketball net which makes scoring easier</p></li>

"Comment my off days training routine (boxing)","<p>I'm a boxer training 3 times a week. I run for about 50 minutes on all other days and when I'm feeling fresh I also jump rope for between 15 and 30 minutes after running. During training there's a lot of push ups, quite some squats and a bit of crunches. It's not enough for me. Naturally I want to focus on the muscle groups most important for boxing: <a href=""http://www.expertboxing.com/boxing-training/boxing-workouts/most-important-muscles-for-fighting"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.expertboxing.com/boxing-training/boxing-workouts/most-important-muscles-for-fighting</a></p>

<p>My weight is right for the class I compete in. I'm 5 ft 9 in and weigh a little over 165 lbs.</p>

<p>I do the following bodyweight exercises at home (I realized early on that I don't need weights because I'm a short stocky guy and develop muscles quickly without having to use any weights):</p>

<p>On one day I will focus on triceps and legs (2 exercises for each) with <strong>pushups</strong>, <strong>dips</strong>, <strong>squats</strong> and <strong>lunges</strong>.</p>

<p>The other day I focus on biceps, back and abs with <strong>neutral grip pull ups</strong>, <strong>situps</strong> and <strong>some lower back exercises</strong> from a lying facedown position. I sometimes also use my pullup bar to get into a dead hang position and then bring my knees up to a 90 degree angle or rotate both knees left and right so the crunches aren't the only exercise for abs.</p>

<p>Do the 2 workouts complement each other well? Are dips necessary when I'm also working my triceps all the time with push ups?</p>

"Why do some players have trouble finishing off a point in tennis?","<p>I played a match with a 19 year old girl (division ? college player). During warm up we were hitting back and forth, she hit hard, had some spin, was pretty consistent, I thought this was going to be a good match. </p>

<p>But then, when we started playing, she couldn't finish the points. When we had rallies she did ok, but when it came to a short ball, or trying to put it away, she would overhit it, or hit it into the net. So it ended up being an easy short match. Maybe if she just stuck with the rallies more, and not tried being so aggressive she would have done better.</p>

"How does the RB know when to grasp the ball on a read option and when the QB is selling the fake?","<p>In American football, on read-option plays, how does the RB know when to fully grasp the ball and when not to because the QB ""pulls"" the ball?</p>

<p>Commentators praise the QB on plays where he sticks the ball in the belly of the RB, only to pull the ball at the very last second and keeps it for a huge gain.  In slow motion, it really looks like the ball is in the stomach of the RB with the RB's hands almost around the ball when the QB pulls it.</p>

<ol>
<li>the QB deciding to handoff the ball but the RB doesn't grasp the
ball and it gets fumbled away or</li>
<li>the QB tries to pull the ball but
the RB has already fully grasped the ball and the ball gets knocked/pulled out by the QB and is fumbled.</li>

"How long should a medal ribbon be?","<p>I made some custom medals for some friends, who are running a race soon.</p>

<p>But I have doubts about how long I should make the ribbon.
Too short and it will be like a necklace, too long and it will go down to the waist.</p>

<p>I have never won a medal myself, so I have nothing to measure by and compare to.
(I have won trophies though, so don't feel sorry for me hehe.)</p>

<p>When I say length, I mean the length of the string (flat silk fabric) from end to end.
Since it's tied in one end forming a loop, I suppose you could also call it the circumference if you were to lay it out as a circle.</p>

<p>What is the common length? Or should I just estimate from how it hangs on myself, aiming for the upper part of the chest?</p>

"Why are woodbats preferred to train with over aluminum bats?","<p>Let me start this off by saying that I have played baseball my whole life, and actually played in college (not for a club team.. the actual team) and  I can't think of why this method of training is preferred.</p>

<p>A lot of younger, developing players (middle school, high school, &amp; college) prefer to hit with woodbats during their winter training, rather than the bats that they are going to be using during the regular season.</p>

<p>Now, the only reason why I have heard as to why this is, is because a woodbat has a smaller 'sweet spot' if you will, or in other words, it doesn't have as much forgiveness as a metal / aluminum bat.  So in translation, if you can make solid contact with a woodbat, then you definitely can make solid contact with a metal / aluminum bat, especially with the amount of forgiveness that those bats give.</p>

<p>My question to that is.. why would you train with a bat that you only use a few months out of the year and you don't use in games?  Shouldn't you train with what you are going to use in games, so that you can build large amounts of confidence with that piece of equipment?</p>

"Swimmer's elbow problems","<p>In the last year I have been, on and off, troubled by what I believe is <em>swimmer's elbow</em>.</p>

<p>The pain does not prevent me from swimming but it is affecting my ability to pull with maximum force in the front &amp; back crawl and especially the butterfly, which I have found to be the stroke that aggravates it the most.</p>

<p>The majority of the pain exists just behind and in front of the elbow, as if it's the tendons or something (I'm not a physio so this is my best description).</p>

<p>The pain does linger during the day and can affect some actions eg. I wince sometimes when putting on or taking off a t-shirt, but I wouldn't describe it as disabling.</p>

<p>So my questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li>is this something I can avoid, perhaps by strengthening muscles further up the arm and, if so, what would they be?</li>
<li>is there anything I can do when I have the pain, to get rid of it? </li>

"Is there a connection between serious injuries/deaths in boxing and having one's father in one's corner?","<p>In the commentary on the tragic 2005 Leavander Johnson/Jesus Chavez fight, which claimed the life of Leavander Johnson, <a href=""https://youtu.be/F4yeA1uHiXI?t=43m49s"" rel=""noreferrer"">commentator Jim Lampley said that there are two things that seem to be ""constant"" in recent fights where a boxer was seriously - sometimes permanently - injured</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the recent history of the sport, when you look at fights where one fighter has been badly, sometimes permanently damaged, two constants seem to be part of the formula. Number one, the opponent who is doing the damage is a hard  hitter, but not a big enough hitter to put the opponent away. <strong>Number two, the guy who is getting worked over has his father in the corner as his trainer, constantly sending him back to take more punishment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcer actually said, in the 10th round, that he hoped that wouldn't be the case for Leavander Johnson, and the fight was stopped early in the 11th round;  however, Leavander Johnson died 5 days later from his injuries.</p>

<p>The State Athletic Commissions of California and Nevada, which are responsible for regulating safety in the ring, also believe the link exists:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prompted by Garcia's death [in May 1995], the California Athletic Commission conducted a preliminary inquiry into California ring injuries since 1980.</p>
  
  <p>It was discovered that <strong>four of the seven most serious head injuries reviewed--including all three California ring-related deaths--involved fighters whose fathers worked their corners</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Richard DeCuir, the commission's executive director</strong>, admits the examination was not scientific--""The numbers have not been scrubbed,"" he said--yet <strong>the findings struck him as alarmingly disproportionate</strong>, given the best estimates that only 5%-7% of professional fighters are trained by relatives.</p>
  
  <p>DeCuir cannot speak to the specifics of each case nor is it his intention to implicate families that have already suffered, yet <strong>he suspects there is a correlation between ring injuries and relatives.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>""I think we all pretty much believe that,"" DeCuir said.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>DeCuir sent his information to Marc Ratner, head of the Nevada State Commission</strong>, who is still grappling with Garcia's death in May.</p>
  
  <p>""It's something we have no choice but to address, because <strong>it is more than coincidence,"" Ratner said of the father-son issue.</strong><br>

<p>The quotes above make it clear that the issue has been investigated at least once, but the source ""admits the examination was not scientific--""The numbers have not been scrubbed."" Thus, we can't resolve the issue with certainty unless someone has done a more scientific study.</p>

<p>But you're the third base umpire, and you know, without any doubt, that the runner on third left early, and, <strong><em>if</em></strong> the defensive team appeals, you need to be there to call the runner on third out with no run scored and the inning over.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to avoid giving hints to the defensive team, wouldn't you need to do the same thing (hang around third) if the runner had tagged up correctly?  To avoid warning the defense in those cases where there is a successful appeal available?</p>

"Does ""Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green"" objectify tee-to-green performance?","<p>In short, ""Strokes Gained"" is a value of a golfer's performance compared to the average performance of other golfers. </p>

<p>In 2011, the PGA Tour announced <a href=""http://www.pgatour.com/stats/academicdata/shotlink.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strokes Gained: Putting</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the average number of putts used to hole out from 7 feet
  10 inches is 1.5. If a player one-putts from this distance, he gains
  0.5 strokes. If he two-putts, he loses 0.5 strokes. If he three-putts, he loses 1.5 strokes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2014, the PGA Tour announced <a href=""http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/26/strokes-gained-tee-to-green-statistic.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green</a>. This includes calculations on how to calculate Strokes Gained: Total.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, a player’s score will be compared to the field’s average to
  establish a Strokes Gained: Total number. For instance, if a player
  shoots 68 and the field average is 70, his Total is +2.0. That number,
  in turn, will equal the combination of Strokes Gained: Putting and
  Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green. So if the player is +1.2 in Strokes
  Gained: Putting, his Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green number is +0.8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this statement, the equation is: <strong>SG<sub>total</sub> = SG<sub>putting</sub> + SG<sub>tee-to-green</sub></strong>. However, <strong>SG<sub>tee-to-green</sub></strong> is derived from <strong>SG<sub>total</sub></strong> and <strong>SG<sub>putting</sub></strong> values. Thus, a golfer's <strong>SG<sub>tee-to-green</sub></strong> value is inversely proportional to their <strong>SG<sub>putting</sub></strong> value.</p>

<p><strong>Does ""Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green"" objectify tee-to-green performance?</strong> Is there any correlation between this statistic and the ball striking statistic<sub>†</sub> + scrambling statistic, its individual parts, or other statistics? </p>

<p><sub>Note: The ball striking statistic and the scrambling statistic doesn't compare to the average performance of other golfers, but does objectively capture driving distance, accuracy, greens in regulation, sand saves, and other around the green recoveries.</sub></p>

<p><sub> † - total driving [driving distance + accuracy] + greens in regulation</sub></p>

"Why do ice hockey teams usually replace their goalie after an empty net goal?","<p>In ice hockey, when a team is losing by a goal in the last few minutes, the coach usually pulls the goalie and replaces them with another player, leaving the net empty, but this doesn't matter since goal difference isn't as important as it is in a sport like football.</p>

<p>If they are losing by 2 goals (sometimes 3 in a playoffs game) they usually pull the goalie with about 2-3 minutes remaining.</p>

<p>If they are losing by 1 goal, they usually pull the goalie with about 90 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>However, I've seen in some situations, a team is losing by 1 goal, so they pull the goalie, but then the other team scores an empty net goal. Now the team is down by 2 goals, but where they would usually pull the goalie when losing by 2, they actually put the goalie back in.</p>

<p>Why is this done? Is it just because the empty net goal demoralizes the team? Or they think they have no chance of coming back from being 2 goals down with only a minute or so left (as opposed to the usual 2-3 minutes)?</p>

<p>Note: There are cases where the above doesn't apply, like yesterday Colorado were losing 1-0 against Detroit when Patrick Roy pulled the goalie with 3 minutes left (he often pulls the goalie very early) and the other team scored an empty net goal just after, but they kept the goalie pulled even though they were now 2-0 down (and the other team actually scored another empty net goal after that making it 3-0).</p>

<p>any idea if its true ? because in La Liga top team (real Madrid &amp; Barcelon) get the bigger chunk of the tv rights money. answers will be appreciated greatly.</p>

"Free throw rules","<p>Scenario:  High School Girls basketball game. Foul happens, 10th foul for the team that fouled. Double bonus for other team. First shot is missed. Shooting team rebounds shoots and makes the basket. Is given 2 points. Questions being asked why? Refs conference, Points are left on the board for the rebound shot and the team originally shooting free throw is then allowed to shoot her second shoot and makes it. Why was the rebound shot permitted in the first place. Double bonus free throws, not a three point shot foul. and they were rewarded for the refs not knowing what the foul count was.</p>

<p>We were told per the rule the two points had to remain on the board even though it was technically a dead ball shot.</p>

"Sign stealing in baseball","<p>I don't understand the current sign stealing issue between the Red Sox and the Yankees. I don't understand how sign stealing in baseball actually works. Just seeing a catcher's sign is not enough.</p>

<p>How can a team know what their opponents' signs actually mean?</p>

<p>Doesn't each team have their own signs?</p>

<p>Don't they change their meanings now and then like a password?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2017/09/06/dustin-pedroia-says-why-such-a-fuss-over-sign-stealing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boston Globe</a> quotes Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our adjustment to that stuff is: go out to the mound and change the
  signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, I guess one could identify the current signs at the start of a game by watching the signs and the pitches that follow. <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/shocking-history-sign-stealing-baseball-053859138.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yahoo</a> describes this process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if someone on a team’s video staff cracks an opponent’s signals, they are run from the video room to an intermediary in the dugout and forwarded to players on the field</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that process would take longer than the actual at bat itself and the information would never reach the batter in time. The only benefactor would be the runner at second base who will know when to steal a base. But he should be able to see the catcher's signs directly and wouldn't need a relay chain.</p>

<p>Of course, that runner could alert the batter directly on what pitch to expect once the signs have been cracked. The <a href=""https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2017/09/06/report-red-sox-used-apple-watch-to-steal-yankees-signs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boston Globe</a> describes this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often times it happens when a runner at second base peers in to see the catcher’s sign and then subtly flashes a signal — maybe a hand movement, or the positioning of his feet — to the batter to let him know whether the next pitch will be a fastball, curveball or something else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how often is there a runner at second base during a game? It's not that big of an advantage in my opinion. And I'm pretty sure all teams have been doing this for 150 years or so.</p>

"What actions are taken by FIFA/UEFA against what's known as filming or diving","<p>It seems to me that modern football is suffering from the kind of unsportsmanly behavior of diving which became all the more common, perhaps with the recent success of southern European teams/nations. </p>

<p>For those who might not be familiar with the concept, diving is the act of fooling the referee into a wrong call, either by pretending as if the tackle is much harder than it really was (in which case the opponent might be punished with a card) or to get a free kick/penalty kick where there is no apparent foul. Not only does it result in unfair calls, but also in many cases it slows the game down due to all the unnecessary free kick calls. In many cases it is normal to see players rolling on the grass seemingly screaming in agony for a second, and up on their feet arguing with an opponent in the next...</p>

<p>With more and more efforts going into campaigns against factors that spoil the game (such as racism) I would like to know if any steps are taken against this type of behavior aimed to interfere with the objective call of the referee? As far as I know, the referee can punish a player with a yellow card if the player is attempting to cheat the referee into giving a penalty but more often than not unnecessary cards and fouls are given as seen by instant replays from different angles.

"How long should I expect a golf glove to last before wearing out?","<p>I currently play with a Nike DuraFeel golf glove on my leading hand. It's practical, it works, and it fits ""like a glove"" (as in perfectly; not too tight but nothing to spare). Sometimes I'll glove both hands; I usually only do this at the range when I'm hitting bucket after bucket, but usually on the course I need to get in and out of my right pocket for tees, spare balls etc which is more difficult with a glove. </p>

<p>The problem is that this glove currently lasts me maybe three to four rounds and/or range visits before the thumb develops a huge hole, and by the end of the first round played they get pretty stiff so I often relegate them to range use after just one or two rounds. That makes worn-out gloves a bigger money sink equipment-wise than lost balls; I play C-grade recycled balls so each one I lose is only about $.50, and my lost-ball count is much lower in recent times than it had been.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Feet shoulder width apart, square to the basket or slightly open, depending on the player.</p></li>
<li><p>Bend your knees and jump using your legs to give the upward power to the ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not throw the ball with your arm. It will be inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Land the same place you jumped, make a straight up and down jump.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold the ball with one hand under and the other on the side to guide the ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your elbow in and straight below the ball pointing to the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>As you reach the top of your jump, let your arm extend upward and release the ball at the top. Your wrist should snap or flop, which gives the ball a backward rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Shoot the ball with a high angle because that exposes the largest opening of the hoop.</p></li>
<li><p>End your shot with your arm up and your wrist down like you are reaching for the basket.</p></li>

<p>I see two possibilities for making the ball go forward.</p>

<ol>
<li>You push the ball forward with your arm near the top of the jump.</li>

<p>The idea for doing this comes from reading Hogan's book ""Five Lessons"".

An easy way to maximize this ideal grip pressure distribution would be to wear a left hand glove that only had the last three ""fingers"" (just cut off the top two, the palm part stays the same) and wear a right handed glove that had only the two middle fingers . This would force you to feel the club through the fingers you want to control the club. </p>

"Sabermetrics and statistics, why so fitting for baseball?","<p>I am looking into defining my own simple metrics for a video game to evaluate how well a player is performing.</p>

<p>To that regard I have been reading about Sabermetrics and the general impression I get as to why Baseball lends itself easily to statistical analysis compared to other sports is that the game naturally rewards individual performance. </p>

<p>To quote from <a href=""http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/sabermetrics4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">howstuffworks.com</a>: ""<em>The beauty of baseball is that its statistics generally capture the performance of one player. And that player's success is often determined by his own actions</em>"". The page continues to argue that a successful play in football is dependent on many other actors.</p>

<p>However, is this not also the case for baseball? Surely when a batter hits a ball, the pitcher has done his best to make it harder for the player to hit the ball. Additionally, whether or not your ball gets caught also depends on how the defense is setup, and thus his success is not only measured by the batter's own actions. I'm not really seeing how baseball is magically easier to quantify with statistics than other sports. </p>

<p>My question is then, is baseball really easier to measure statistically? Or is the reason why baseball dominate the world of sport statistics just natural consequence of the fact that people have been revising and developing statistics for the sport since it's beginning?</p>

<p>I must disclaim that I cannot pretend to know much about baseball since baseball has never really been part of my life, so maybe I am missing something obvious here.</p>

"Why no uniform testing for doping at major sporting events?","<p>It seems that doping scandals are still very much a part of big sporting events. There are the recent news about the Russian team at the Olympics, the Tour de France scandals, and I'm sure there are more. In the Russian case, for example, we're finding - years after the event - officials that are testifying to the widespread use of doping, including by gold medalists, and we're finding evidence that the analysis lab (run by Russian officials) was falsifying results.</p>

<p>I do not understand why this is still a part of sports. It seems that there's a simple solution: just test <strong>every participant in a sporting event</strong>, right on the day of the event, in a uniform/standardized way, by the same independent laboratory, with supervisors from the public (perhaps even broadcast to the public), instead of just selective testing by country-specific secretive and closed labs as seems to be the case now. </p>

<p>If for some reason the tests are prohibitively expensive, then make it a rule that tests will always be taken from people who score one of first 3 places in a given competition. Or run basic tests on every participant, and very extensive/thorough tests on the winners.</p>

"Touching ball scenario in 8-ball","<p>In the game of 8-ball: suppose my opponent plays his/her shot without a foul, and the cue ball ends in a touching-ball situation (that is, the white ball stops right next to a ball, declared to be touching upon a close inspection). So now it is my turn to play, having been handed a touching ball situation, I see two scenarios: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The cue ball is in a touching situation with one of my own balls (say I had called <em>stripes</em> at the start of the game). Then I can call the touching ball to be my next shot, and it suffices to shoot the cue ball away from it, and it would count as if I had hit the called ball. </p></li>
<li><p>The cue ball is in a touching situation with one of my opponent's balls (solid color). Then by the same token, no matter what shot I call, shooting away would appear as if I had first hit my opponent's ball, because the cue ball <strong>was</strong> in touching with an opponent's ball. But that wouldn't make any sense, because I would then simply have no legal shots, and any play would be foul before me making any shot. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>To remedy the 2nd scenario, I've been reading the rules again, and there's no bit that directly addresses this situation, namely, a touching situation where the two balls are the cue ball and one of opponent's ball. <a href=""https://wpapool.com/rules-of-play/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In one case</a>, the rules say the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5.9 Touching Balls</p>
  
  <p>If the cue ball is touching an object ball, the shooter must not play
  the cue ball in the direction of that ball. He is considered to have
  hit the touching ball when he shoots away from it if the ball is on
  for the shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it does not specify, what if the touching ball is an opponent's ball, it seems to assume the touching ball is one of my own balls, hence the remark at the end ""...if the ball is on for the shot."" It can only be <em>on for a shot</em> if it is one of my own balls (stripes). </p>

<p><a href=""https://bca-pool.com/general/custom.asp?page=55"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Another source</a> suggests something somewhat orthogonal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.18     FAILURE TO CONTACT OBJECT BALL </p>
  
  <p>It is a foul if on a stroke the cue ball fails to make contact with any legal object ball first.
  Playing away from a touching ball does not constitute having hit that
  ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>How are such touching ball situations resolved? What legal shots do I have in case of 1. and 2.? Specially in case of 2., can I hit away from the touching ball even if the cue ball had been in touching/frozen situation with one of opponent's balls? 
It would be incredibly useful if you could also include a link to the rules with which you answer the question.</p>

"Is there a standard (advanced?) stat in basketball for measuring player ""consistency""?","<p>Is there an accepted stat that analysts use to measure how consistent a basketball player is? </p>

<p>Take points per game (or points per 48 min): two players with the same average scoring rates could have very different game distributions. Of course standard deviation comes right to mind (after you standardize it to account for high vs low scorers), and it makes sense when I try it. </p>

<p>But...  </p>

<ul>
<li>Is another measure even more informative? I've looked at some data
and am intrigued by other possible stats, but with only small
datasets (and somewhat limited personal impressions of specific
player [in]consistency in the NBA this year), the patterns I'm
seeing could just be red herrings. :)   </li>
<li>Even if you use standard deviation, would any adjustments be needed?
I'm not sure for example if low scorers would
need to be handled differently, or if that all comes out in the wash
once you standardize the data. And do you weight right skewed data differently, so it hurts your consistency rating less when you score more (vs less) than your average?</li>
<li>What scale is most intuitive to use for the ""consistency"" measure? If
you use standardized SD, for example, would it be %, where 100% is
the player who always scores 12 every night? (what a machine!) Is there a scaling that would make comparisons between two realistic players' consistencies more meaningful than 25% vs 35%?</li>
</ul>

<p>So I wonder if consistency is a ""thing of interest"" in sports analytics, and if so how pro analysts handle questions such as those.</p>

In it, 23 White gathers the ball after ending his dribble, establishing his left foot as his pivot foot. He then steps right-left, and the referee calls a traveling violation.</p>

<p>I was then looking at the <a href=""https://official.nba.com/rule-no-10-violations-and-penalties/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2018-2019 NBA rulebook</a>. </p>

<p>Rule 10, Section XIII, point (d), says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 23 White raised his pivot foot off the floor and returned it to the floor while the ball was still in his hands, this would suggest that the referee made the right call.</p>

<p>But Rule 10, Section XIII, point (b), says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon
  completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop,
  passing or shooting the ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>23 White, upon completion of a dribble, gathered the ball on his left foot, establishing his left foot as his pivot foot. Until now he has made no steps. He then steps with his right foot: Step 1. Afterwards he steps with his left foot: Step 2. So it looks like 23 White is complying with this rule.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Section XIII, point (b), allowing something that point (d) of the same section does not allow? What am I missing here?</li>

<p>So supposedly it only is know <strong>who</strong> will play, but not <strong>in what formation</strong> or where each player will play within that formation. This makes sense, because a formation can change at any moment, while the line up itself won't.</p>

<p>So how does the broadcasting TV channel and commentators know those details?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do the teams usually give out this information to the media? Wouldn't that be a tactical disadvantage?</li>

"Which non-players in the NFL are the highest paid apart from the GM and head coach?","<p>One of the things I learned from Michael Lewis's <em>The Blind Side</em> is that how much various parties get paid is a good window into their perceived value by their franchises (in the case of <em>The Blind Side</em> the observation was that left tackles are well-paid in the NFL because they protect the super important quarterback). I know that head coaches and GMs can make a lot in the NFL. For example, <a href=""http://itiswhatitis.weei.com/sports/newengland/football/patriots/2013/05/22/forbes-bill-belichick-second-highest-paid-coach-in-america/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>'s an article saying that Sean Payton makes $8,000,000 a year. Besides the players, the head coach, and the GM, what tend to be the highest paid roles at an NFL franchise? For example, I've heard it said at a good athletic trainer can make a huge difference. Does the market agree?</p>

"Why are coaches potentially allowed to play as goalies in the NHL?","<p>I was just watching ESPN and a team (Florida Panthers I think) had both goalies hurt and they showed an ASSISTANT COACH suit up to get ready to play.  He didn't need to go out but I'm just curious with the rules in the NHL.  Are coaches allowed to play like this in the NHL?  Are other coaches/managers of other sports allowed to play on an emergency basis?</p>

<p>I didn't see Isaiah Thomas suit up when he was coaching the Knicks several yrs ago, I didn't see Ryne Sandberg suit up for the Phillies to play a few innings while managing them.  Why was that assistant coach allowed to possibly play for the Panthers?</p>

"Rugby Union knock on rule in scoring a try","<p>Can someone help with the knock on rule when scoring a try. In the Ireland v England 6 Nations game, the slow motion reply appeared to show Henshaw first catching the ball, then he appeared to lose control of it temporarily so that he was no longer touching the ball, and the ball was moving forwards. He then put his hand on the ball before it touched the ground, and clearly touched it down. </p>

<p>My question is (in this game or any other game with the same circumstances), if this was the case, was this a knock on, because he did not catch the ball before it hit the ground as the rules suggest? Or does the law allow the touching down in the goal area to be the equivalent of catching the ball in the remainder of the pitch ? Any ideas appreciated. </p>

"How much of a skill difference is there in penalty taking/defending between professionals and everyone else","<p>People often talk about penalty kicks in soccer/football as if they were a guessing game, where the keeper tries to guess to what part of goal the the penalty-taker is going to kick the ball before the ball is even struck. <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_undercover_economist/2006/06/world_cup_game_theory.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Economists have studied it as a game theory problem</a>, like a slightly more complex version of rock/paper/scissors that plays out on a human scale.</p>

"Does a team stop batting if it cannot win?","<p>In last night's Scotland-Sri Lanka match, Scotland lost their last wicket after 43.1 overs, 363/9 to 215/10 (43.1).  At that point, averaging just under 5 runs per over, Scotland would have reached a point around the 47th over, where it would have been no longer (realistically) possible to win the match.</p>

<p>For example, say they had not been dismissed in 43.1, and instead scored 5 (more) runs in that over, leading to 220 at 44.0.  They then scored 5 more runs for the next several overs; at 47.0 they have a score of 235.  With 18 balls remaining in 3 overs, they now trail by 128; but even if they hit sixes on every single ball, they could only score 108.  Yes, there might have been extras, but hardly twenty of them.</p>

<p>Had this happened, would they continue to bat (pointlessly)?  (I realize that in some circumstances, total runs scored might factor into tiebreaks for going on, but clearly not in Scotland's case.)  Would it have been by choice (similar to declaring an innings at end in a Test match, though that is usually for the opposite reason) or by rule?</p>

"In which year of the Campeonato Paulista the teams would dispute penalty shot-out before the game in order to win a point in the case of draw?","<p>When I was younger I remember watching some football matches in Brazil. Now, I don't remember if it was the Brazilian league of if it was state leagues inside Brazil. But I am almost 100% sure that they were matches of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Campeonato Paulista</a>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each match they would dispute a penalty shoot-out to decide who would win an extra point in case the game was tied.</p>

<p>Here was the logic that was explained to me at the time:</p>

<ul>
<li>In football, when a team wins it gets 3 points and the other team gets 0 points.</li>
<li>When a match is tied, each team receives 1 point.</li>
<li>So technically a match is worth 3 points for a win-lose game, but it is worth only 2 points for a tie-tie game.</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve this ""problem"" (in quotation because it turns out it is not a big problem after all) the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF in Portuguese) decided to test this formula where teams would dispute shoot-outs at the start of every game to see who would win one extra point in the case of a tied match.</p>

<p>I would like to know which year that formula was adopted? And, if possible, why it was not implemented in the following years? Was it a FIFA recommendation to implement it in the first place? Was it ever tested somewhere else? I asked some of my friends from Brazil but they think I am dreaming...</p>

"How does golf technology compensate for the ""groove rule"" for golf clubs?","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Can V-grooves replicate the performance of U-grooves via golf technology? In other words: How does golf technology compensate for the ""groove rule"" for golf clubs?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.usga.org/news/2008/August/USGA-Announces-Rules-Changes-On-Golf-Club-Grooves/"" rel=""noreferrer"">United States Golf Association</a> (USGA) implemented a ""groove rule"" for golf clubs effective January 1, 2010. </p>

<p>This rule allows only V-grooves (and similar conformed grooves) to be used in competitions on The PGA Tour, the European PGA Tour, the LPGA, the PGA of America and the International Federation of PGA Tours. U-grooves previously conformed to regulations, but no longer do with this new rule.</p>

<p>A reason for the implementation of this new rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for
  the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less
  of a key factor for success,"" said USGA Senior Technical Director Dick
  Rugge. ""We believe that these changes will increase the challenge of
  the game at the Tour level, while having a very small effect on the
  play of most golfers.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information on U-grooves and V-grooves:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUlF6.gif"" alt=""V-grooves""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The research undertaken and published by the USGA and The R&amp;A
  demonstrates that for shots from the rough with urethane-covered balls
  (the type of ball most used by highly skilled players), modern,
  sharp-edged U-grooves result in higher ball spin rates and steeper
  ball landing angles than the V-groove designs used predominantly in
  the past. The combination of a higher spin rate and steeper landing
  angle results in better control when hitting to the green. Shots from
  the rough become more similar to shots from the fairway, creating less
  challenge for shots from the rough.</p>

<h2>Judging Criteria</h2>

<p>I found the following judging criteria in this <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/542249-judging-criteria-for-boxing/"">article</a>.  The author sources the <a href=""http://www.aiba.org/documents/site1/docs/technical_and_competition_rules_20110801%20-%20LATEST%20VERSION.pdf"">International Boxing Association Technical &amp; Competition Rules</a> and the <a href=""http://www.vipers.co.uk/images/WBA_boxing_rules.pdf"">World Boxing Association Regulations and Rules Governing World Championship Contests</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Qualification</strong></p>
  
  <p>Before a fighter begins a bout, he must qualify according to the rules
  of the sanctioning organization.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Counting Punches</strong></p>
  
  <p>Throughout the course of each round, judges count the number of
  punches each boxer lands. These punches are divided between ""power
  punches"" that land solidly with force, and ""glancing punches"" such as
  a light jab, or a punch that slides along the body. Punches with no
  force, or punches to the arms, are not counted at all.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Winning the Round</strong> </p>
  
  <p>If a fighter has scored more punches at the end of a round, the judges award the round to that fighter. If it's a tie,
  the win goes to the fighter each judge decides showed the most
  control, technique or style during the round.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Winning the Bout</strong> </p>
  
  <p>A fighter who wins a round receives 10 points for that round. The loser of a round receives 9 or fewer points, based on
  the margin by which he lost. As a general rule, receiving less than 9
  points only happens in the case of a knockdown, penalty point or
  similar major sign that a fighter was outclassed. After all rounds are
  fought, the judges total the scores to determine a match total.
  Whoever has the most points wins.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Knockout and Technical Knockout</strong> </p>
  
  <p>A fighter is considered knocked out if he is knocked down and unable to stand after a 10-second count.
  If a fighter gets knocked down and stands in time but is knocked down
  enough times, the referee will stop the match as a technical knockout.
  Referees will also award a ""TKO"" if one fighter appears to be no
  longer able to defend himself or seems to be severely concussed.</p>

"Head Position in Swimming","<p>I am trying to fix my head and hip positioning by looking down instead of forward and pressing my chest and / or head down.</p>

<p>It's kind of awkward to press your chest down while also looking down and keeping your head at the surface of the water. My friend tells me that I was swimming with my whole body about an inch below the surface. But I'm pretty sure it was faster.</p>

<p>In some videos, Phelps looks like he's looking pretty far forward, so I tried to look a little forward and press only my chest. That felt like it really worked to get my hips on the surface and my head at the top, but I was told that my head was still underwater and it also didn't feel quite as fast. It was also hard to press the chest without feeling like I was looking way too far forward. </p>

<p>I'm sure I'll get used to this, but when I press my chest down, I feel like I have so much less breath. I'm a sprinter, so it's less of a big deal, but I'm hoping that goes away eventually or is at least normal?</p>

<p>Some of the later positions I've tried for head and hip position have made my upper lats through my shoulders through the top of the arm ache/hurt, and this aching is accentuated when I switch to a kickboard for kicking sets. I think I've become lazy in my arm pulls as I work on other technical issues (which may be contributing to this), but part of it I think is that my arm is floating above my head and body so when I rotate and pull the arm, it doesn't have as much power. </p>

<p>Thorpe complicates the whole issue because apparently he lets his hips drop a little so he can use his legs to power him along better. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to a comment and to clarify further - I am talking about <em>any</em> style of lift. I do not care about how far the object is lifted off the ground. It could be just 1mm. This does introduce a problem, particularly for bulky objects (like cars) because you have to check very carefully that all four wheels are off the ground <em>at the same time</em>. So the refereeing of the lift must be strict for the record to count. I would expect the heaviest weight lifted to be way way more (2x? 3x?) than simply the world record squat.</p>

"Why does a player have to serve a Too Many Men on the Ice penalty?","<p>When an ice-hockey team has too many players on the ice, it is given a ""Too Many Men on the Ice"" penalty. The rules recognize that this is not the fault of any individual player, and so assign a penalty to the team. However, a specific player is required to sit in the penalty box while the team is shorthanded for two minutes. It is not the player who is most to blame for the penalty, as the penalized team gets to choose which player goes to the box.</p>

"How often does this achievement happen in basketball?","<p>We have 5 categories in basketball which we take into account when triple-double or quadruple-double is achieved. They are: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots.</p>

<p>The achievement of quadruple-double is extremely rare, triple-double is not so rare, and I have defined the achievement that splits rebounds into offensive ones and defensive ones and I do not know how often such an achievement happens?</p>

<p>Now, to define it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us call an achievement in basketball a <em>jumper´s triple-double</em> if the following two conditions are fulfilled:</p>
  
  <p>1) The player has a double digit number of offensive rebounds and a double digit number of defensive rebounds.</p>
  
  <p>2) The player has a double digit number of two out of the remaining four categories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, if someone has 19 points and 10 assists and 23 rebounds and if 8 rebounds are offensive and 15 defensive than he did not achieve a <em>jumper´s triple-double</em> but if 11 rebounds are offensive and 12 defensive than he did achieve a <em>jumper´s triple-double</em>.</p>

<p>Now, two questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) How often does the achievement of <em>jumper´s triple-double</em> happen (for instance, how many times we can expect it in one professional basketball season (you can take NBA as an example if you want))?</p>
  
  <p>2) Can you give some documented examples of basketball players that achieved <em>jumper´s triple-double</em>?</p>

<p>Please take a look at <strong>Rule 3 - Section 2 - Article 7 (PLAYER POSSESSION)</strong></p>

<p>My question is about the notes on page 5 of the rulebook. There it says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by
  contact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who
  caught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really understand the last sentence of this Note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a <strong>touchback</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understood this rule correctly, the situation described is that of a ball coming loose after it has been previously <strong>caught or intercepted</strong>. Now: if I catch a pass in my opponent's end zone or if I intercept one of his passes in his end zone, I'm scoring a touchdown, no matter what happens after that. If I secure the catch and an opponent smacks into me, causing me to lose the ball, that's still a TD, since I controlled the ball previously. And if I fail to make the catch, that's an incomplete pass and the next play begins. So how could this situation (making a catch in my opponents end zone) lead to a touchback? What am I missing here? </p>

<p>I guess the same question could apply in any situation where the frame is in jeopardy if the cue ball gets into position. In other words, let's say that if the cue ball lands in favorable position for the other player, then you will lose the frame.

"How can Real Madrid poach players from its near-peers?","<p>Real Madrid is evidently in pursuit of such high profile players as <a href=""https://www.beinsports.com/us/laliga/news/real-madrid-plot-record-breaking-mbappe-bid/1148605"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kylian Mbappe</a> and <a href=""https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/03/25/5c9813eb468aebb7108b456a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sadio Mane</a>. Both those players are young and good...and valuable. Any world-class club would like to build around them. So why would PSG and Liverpool let them go?</p>

<p>Deloitte's 2019 <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Football Money League</a> shows that Real has annual revenues of €750M; while PSG is at €540M and Liverpool is at €510M. Real is richer, but not by much. Let us say that Mbappe transfers for €300 and Sane for €100. If we amortized the transfer fees over 2 years; then Real's annual income is down to €550M, a year; no real advantage over PSG or Liverpool. So, even if Real doesn't pay to transfer in another big name for 2 more years, the high cost of the transfer fee means they shouldn't be able to offer a more lucrative contract to the players in question than other world-class teams with high revenues.</p>

<p>In general, I don't understand how any of the top tier teams are able to afford to transfer player from the other top tier teams. In some cases, like Ronaldo going to Juventus, it seems that it was the player's idea to make the move. But absent player unhappiness, if Sane is happy in Liverpool, then why can't Liverpool pay enough to keep him?</p>

<p>How does Real Madrid, in particular, have the financial muscle to buy whoever they want, even from other teams with top-10 revenues?</p>

"What does ""weight"" mean in the context of putting?","<p>In Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds, the phrase ""give it weight"" is occasionally muttered by a caddie before a player attempts a putt. I always thought since the game is a caricature of golf, the phrase was specific to the quirkiness of said game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perfect weight, but misses an inch or two left. Tiger's par is conceded.</p>

<p>Given the context, ""weight"" seems to mean ""speed on a putt."" Thus, ""give it weight"" would seem to mean ""apply speed to the putt."" Would this be accurate? In conjunction, is there any history of the term's origins or usage throughout the years? I haven't heard ""weight"" used during golf broadcasts in this context.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about flagship series like Formula 1, NASCAR or Rallye World Championship. I'm talking about all those weird small series at least I have never heard about.

You need cars, you have to rent a race track, you need mechanics, etc. How can these championships pay off if you have no or hardly media coverage and maybe a few people watching at the track? Two possible answers emerge to me.</p>

"Rugby league: does a knock-on require an immediate stoppage of play?","<p>In a few recent rugby league (Australian NRL) games that I have seen, a player will drop a ball that was passed to him, causing it to move forward off of his hands and bounce forward on the ground. Subsequently, a player from the opposing team will rush toward the ball, grab it, and make a mad dash toward their opponent's goal line.</p>

<p>From looking through the official rules, it is my understanding that dropping the ball in a forward motion (except during a charge-down) is a knock-on, which, according to the book, should result in a scrum being awarded to the defense.</p>

<p>Why is the recovering player allowed to take over possession of the ball without a scrum?</p>

Based on the description given there it seems that simply the top players in the race rankings are taken. (The only thing which is slightly more complicated is which tournaments have to be counted, it seems that they are Grand Slams and some Premier level tournaments, with some possible exceptions.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Apart from rankings, are there some other conditions player has to fulfill to qualify?</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_ATP_World_Tour_Finals#Qualification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">men's tournament</a><sup>3</sup>, Grand Slam winner might qualify even if he is not in the top 8 positions of rankings.

But if you look at WTA rankings, the US Open winner <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sloane Stephens</a> missed the first half of the season due to surgery, so she is very unlikely to get into top 8. So if there is a similar rule also for WTA finals, it could make difference.)</li>
<li>Another example: In an online discussion, I was told that one of the condition for qualifying is that the player has to win at least one WTA tournament during the year. However, I was not able to find any confirmation of this rule. (And this would contradict the Wikipedia article - Venus Williams is listed among players who already qualified, but so far she does not have a WTA title in this season. Of course, what somebody claims online is far from being a reputable source, but still that made me curious.)</li>

<sup>2</sup>Some exceptions concerning the premier tournaments are mentioned in the footnotes below the table saying: ""The player's ranking at the time did not qualify her to play this event.

"Do sportsbooks structure ""lossless"" bets?","<p>Brand new to sportsbetting here, and am trying to understand something. Does the oddsmaker/betmaker ever stand to lose money, or do they structure their offered bets in such a way that they <em>always</em> make money no matter what the result is?</p>

<hr>

<p>Say you have Team A playing Team B, and an oddsmaker offers a bet on this game with a limit of, say $25 on it. For this question, I don't <em>think</em> the odds actually matter at all.</p>

<p>Let's keep it simple and pretend that only 5 people place bets on this game. Each and every one of them bets on Team A at the max bet limit of $25. That's 5 x $25 = <strong>$125</strong> the betmaker now has in her pocket.</p>

<p>Team A wins. If I understand things correctly here, I believe that they are now owed -- from the betmaker -- two times their original bet (so $25 x 2 = <strong>$50</strong>). This means 5 bettors need to be paid out $50 each, for a total of <strong>$250</strong>. In this scenario, this betmaker is at a loss of $125 - $250 = <strong>-$125</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if they take a 10% vig/juice, they're still out of pocket and at a loss on this one.</p>

"Is it a foul for the defender to preemptively slide tackle a potential shot?","<p>Let's say that the striker is closing in to the goal post on the right side.  As a defender, I am running towards the middle of the right post and the striker.  I perform a slide tackle towards the line in anticipation of a shot from the striker.</p>

<p>3 possible scenarios could happen with the slide tackle:</p>

<ol>
<li>The striker hits the ball and I might take it out of play with my slide tackle</li>
<li>The striker side steps me and continues to the goal</li>
<li>The slide tackle in front of the striker caught him by surprise and he crashes into me with the ball.</li>

"Relief from cart path on a hill","<p>I sent this question to the USGA, based on a situation from my last round; we'll see what they say in about a month (if that), but I thought I'd let you guys have a try as I'll be playing the same course before the USGA's likely to get back to me.</p>

<p><strong>EDITED:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player's ball has come to rest in bounds against the outside edge
  (opposite to the fairway) of a formed concrete cart path running
  roughly parallel to the line of play, which is an immovable
  obstruction. This cart path travels perpendicular to the incline of a
  hill rising away from the fairway, such that the nearest point of
  relief from the current lie (the closest point perpendicular to the
  desired line of play at which the cart path no longer impedes the
  player's stance or swing) is further up the incline. The player takes
  relief under Rule 24-2b(i) by dropping the ball at this nearest point
  of relief. The ball hits the turf and rolls back down the incline,
  again coming to rest against the outside of the cart path, thus
  requiring a re-drop under 20-2c. This has the same result, and again under rule 20-2c, the ball is required to be placed at the spot; it still rolls, and rolls again when replaced under 20-3, and no suitable point within a clublength of the nearest point of relief can be found where the ball will remain where it is placed.</p>
  
  <p>The player and his fellow-competitors concede that attempting to take
  relief at the determined point is futile. So, the player determines a new ""nearest
  point of relief"" to be on the opposite side of the cart path, and
  drops a ball at that point. The ball then rolls down the incline onto
  the fairway (not nearer the hole), coming to rest more than two
  clublengths away from the point of relief, and thus requiring a
  re-drop under 20-2c; however, the situation is similar, as whether dropped or placed the ball is almost certain to roll into a position violating 20-2 or 20-3. A fellow-competitor also says that this is a violation of Rule 13-2 as, in taking relief, the player has moved his ball from the rough to the fairway, thus dramatically improving its lie and the line of play beyond what is reasonable to allow in taking relief from the obstruction.</p>
  
  <p>The player and fellow-competitors decide on two solutions they feel to
  be equitable: first, to allow the player to play the ball as it now
  lies <em>under penalty of one stroke</em>; or second, to return the ball to
  its original lie, and then use the procedure under Rule 28b
  (determining a point on a line between the lie and the hole and behind
  the current lie) to define the ""nearest point of relief"" at which the
  player may take relief under 24-2b(i) <em>without penalty</em>. The player is
  given the choice and chooses the latter, and the ball is dropped
  successfully at a point 25 yards behind the initial lie, inside the
  cart path, and played from that spot to completion of the hole.</p>
  
  <p>Did the players proceed correctly? Would it also have been correct to
  choose the first option?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> edmastermind29's answer to the question as originally stated is completely true and correct; the ball should be placed at the nearest point of relief if after both a drop and re-drop the ball comes to rest in a spot where the obstruction interferes. </p>

<p>However, Rule 20-3d states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a ball when placed fails to come to rest on the spot on which it was placed, there is no penalty and the ball must be replaced. If it still fails to come to rest on that spot:</p>
  
  <p>(i) except in a hazard, it must be placed at the nearest spot where it can be placed at rest that is not nearer the hole and not in a hazard;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We may assume, for the purposes of this question, that the hill is steep enough that the ball will roll when placed as well as when dropped; that the crest of the hill is out of bounds; and thus that the ""nearest spot where the [the ball] can be placed at rest that is not nearer the hole"" is at the edge of the fairway near the bottom of the incline (this really was the situation; the hill, being mostly in the rough, was not being watered due to drought conditions, and as a result what grass there was was thin, dormant and providing virtually no rolling resistance). Thus, the situation would have been the same after the correct procedures were followed.</p>

<p>Rule 13-2 states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player must not improve or allow to be improved:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the position or lie of his ball</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

"Why do swimmers peak at such a young age?","<p>Why do swimmers reach their peak performance at a relatively young age compared with track and field athletes? Particularly female swimmers seem to produce their best results in their late teens to early twenties. This seems to be true for both sprint and longer distances.</p>

<p>By contrast, track sprinters peak at an older age than swimmers, and endurance runners even older. Is there perhaps a buoyancy issue? Do younger swimmers who are not fully developed physically have an advantage because they have built up the muscles they need through training, but have an overall physique that isn't fully bulked out, meaning less dead weight? Compared with track athletes, a streamlined body is more important since water drag is much greater than air. I would be interested in an answer that addressed the physiology involved.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is a study using the career performance of thousands of athletes. <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/g338206j72233hq5/fulltext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/g338206j72233hq5/fulltext.html</a> Statistically, swimmers peak at 21 and runners at 26. That's what the data says, but the study doesn't go deeply into the physiology of why that might be the case. However, swimmers are still peaking a good 5 years before runners.</p>

"Disqualification due to unmotivated play/intentional losing","<p>Yesterday I read about the latest ""scandal"" at the Olympic games in London, that 8 players (4 pairs) have been disqualified from the Womens' badminton championship due to ""not using one's best efforts to win"" (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677"" rel=""nofollow"">the article on BBC</a>).

"Why do athletes need help standing up?","<p>Watching televised sports, especially American Football and Basketball, it seems that whenever a player falls or is knocked down, he needs help getting back up. With football, it is somewhat understandable, since they wear pads that get in the way. But for a basketball player, it seems trivial to stand up, yet I often see players sit on the court until another player offers them a hand up.</p>

<p>Is there a reason for this? I understand that one reason might be a form of team camaraderie. But is there any other reason? Is it difficult for the downed player to stand on his own?</p>

<p><em>Edited to add</em></p>

<p>I understand the sportsmanship element in helping an opponent (or teammate) up. </p>

<p>But today I saw a college basketball player sitting on the court, long after most other players were moving on, waving at teammates to come over and give him a hand up. It wasn't an act of sportsmanship, it seemed more like he needed help simply to stand up (and no, he wasn't injured). I actually see this quite often and it always puzzles me. </p>

<p>As I said, I can understand it in football due to the pads they wear affecting mobility when on the ground, but that isn't present in basketball. I don't really watch any other sports, so I don't know if it is prevalent anywhere else.</p>

"Why don't professional bowlers score higher?","<p>It appears the average professional bowler scores around 230-240 out of 300. In my opinion, this should be much higher. </p>

<p>In bowling, unlike other sports, there is one movement you need to perfect: the movement that gets you a strike. There are no other players to tackle you; just you, the ball, and stationary pins. The fact that pros rarely get a perfect 300 leads me to believe that there must be significant variables that I am missing. All I can think of is the ball being used (size, weight, etc.), floor friction, and pin size and weight. However, this doesn't seem enough to account for this semi-low average as these variables will only ever differ by a minuscule amount. </p>

"Who decides how are UEFA competitions spots divided within teams in some country?","<p>As far as I know, UEFA allocates some number of places in the European competitions based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient#Country_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">country coefficients</a>. </p>

<p>However, I have seen (if I remember correctly) various rules in various countries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usually the spots in Champions League and the first spots in Europa league are given based on the league table.</li>
<li>At least in some countries, I have seen that that cup winners have earned UEFA Europa Leagues spot, too. Moreover, some countries have more than one cup.</li>
<li>Sometimes the rule is that if a winner of a cup qualifies for some European tournament through the position in the league table, the runner-up is given the spot. (For example, here is a quote from Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_FA_Cup"" rel=""nofollow"">2010-11 FA Cup</a>: <em>...because Manchester City qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League via their top-four finish in the 2010–11 Premier League, Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League as runners-up.</em>)</li>
<li>Sometimes if a cup winner qualifies through their position in the league competition, the spot is not given to the runner-up but to the next team in the league table. (For example, in the Wikipedia article about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Premier_League"" rel=""nofollow"">2008-09 Premier League</a> I read that: <em>Due to Manchester United winning the League Cup,their place was given to the seventh-placed team in the league.</em> Similarly, the current revision of the article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013-14_Premier_League"" rel=""nofollow"">2013-14 Premier Leagues</a> says that: <em>Since the 2013–14 Football League Cup winners (Manchester City) would at this point qualify for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League the 6th placed team would qualify for third qualifying round of UEFA Europa League.</em> So the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Football_League_Cup"" rel=""nofollow"">2013-14 League Cup</a> runner up, Sunderland, did no receive a spot in European competitions.)</li>
</ul>

"Could the home field advantage in baseball be due to the ""principle of last action?""","<p>It has been observed that in baseball, a home team has a statistical 54-46 advantage, all other things being equal. There have been various theories to account for this, including the impact of fan support, and possible ""home team"" bias by umpires.</p>

<p>But there may be a more tangible home team advantage called the ""principle of last action."" This advantage derives from the fact that the home team bats and score last in every inning, and in the game itself.</p>

<p>In poker, there is a large advantage to being last, and seeing what other people have done. For instance, if you are ""last"" with a mediocre hand, and have observed other people betting timidly (or not at all), you might bet to steal the pot. If others have ""raised"" each others' bets, you might ""fold"" and let the stronger hands fight it out. If you were first to go with the same, mediocre hand, you would have to bet (or not) without knowing what others wanted to do.</p>

<p>Beginning in the ninth, and all the extra innings, if the home team ever takes the lead, the visiting team will not have a ""return"" opportunity in a subsequent inning. The home team can win in a one-run ""walk-off,"" while the visiting team will have to score as many runs as they can in the top of the ninth, and hope that they are ""enough.""</p>

<p>Say the game is tied at the end of the eigth inning, and the visiting team scores x runs in the TOP of the ninth. The home team knows that it needs to score exactly X runs to tie, and x+1 runs to win. It can manage it ""bench"" in the bottom of the ninth for maximum effect. On the other hand, if the visiting team has a one run lead in the top of the ninth, it must wonder, is that enough? Can we save the bench for tomorrow, or do we need to ""pile on,"" now? Likewise, the visiting team has to make a decision in the bottom of the ninth whether to use as many pitchers as it takes to stop the tying run, or save relievers for an extra inning game.</p>

<p>Other sports such as football and basketball don't have such a clear separation of offensive and defensive ""rounds."" (In those sports, unlike baseball, it is possible for a defender to ""run back"" the ball for a touchdown or basket.) Could this separation of offense and defense be what lends a home field advantage in baseball?</p>

"What is tie-breaking procedure in NHL (regular season)?","<p>What is tie-breaking procedure in NHL (regular season)?</p>

<p>How are standings for the teams in the NHL table decided. What is used as a secondary criterion, if the teams have the same number of points?</p>

<hr>

<p>For example, with one match remaining for Detroit and Washington the positions of wild card teams in Eastern Conference are</p>

<pre><code>   |            | GP | pts | diff
 1 | Columbus   | 82 | 93  | +15
 2 | Detroit    | 81 | 91  | -11
 3 | Washington | 81 | 89  | -4
</code></pre>

<p>(GP = number of games played, pts = number of points, diff = <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference"" rel=""noreferrer"">goal difference</a>)</p>

<p>I have seen in many sources that at this point the teams qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs are already decided and that Washington Capitals cannot qualify. But it is still possible that both Washington Capitals and Detroit Red Wings both finish at 91 points. (Capitals would have to win their last game, and Detroit would have to loose in regulation time.) Moreover, Washington would have better goal difference. So I wonder why they cannot qualify.</p>

"How do I get over caution of going fast (with minimal access to slopes)?","<p>I've only gone snowboarding once (a 2-week exclusively-snowboarding holiday), about 3 years ago.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun, even though I didn't manage to come right too well.</p>

<p>The problem was that, even though I managed to get turning and such right, I really struggled to get much further than knowing the basics, as I'm too cautious about picking up speed (even carving was a problem, although the slopes were pretty steep, at least for me - it felt like about a 30-40° incline on most of the slopes where I was - this was on the ""easy"" slope - the ""medium"" slope seemed pretty similar).</p>

<p>I did fall <strong>a lot</strong> at first (as I guess most, if not all, new snowboarders do), so I can't imagine fear of falling, as such, is the problem.</p>

<p>I did take a few lessons during the first week. I got fairly comfortable with basically just going down the slope (at least better than with my board fully horizontally the whole way) and making the occasional turn, but the next part of the lessons was carving, which, as mentioned above, was a problem, so I felt a bit stuck for the remaining week and a half.</p>

<p>How do I get over this caution of going fast?</p>

<p>I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Choosing to ignore that little voice telling me to not go fast.</p>

<p>This probably wouldn't be too difficult, but I fear that, not being particularly experienced, I may not be able to react properly to certain situations (which may include trying to slow down / stop), and risk serious injury.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking up skateboarding so I can get more comfortable on a board.</p>

<p>Given that part of my problem is minimal access to slopes (because of distance and price), I thought it might be a good idea to get started with skateboarding, which I can do locally. A board's a board - right? Or not?</p></li>
<li><p>Just practice at the speed I'm comfortable with.</p>

<p>The problem here is the minimal access to slopes. And during my snowboarding experience, I seemed to just be stuck skill-wise during the last week of my trip because of this speed problem (not being able to go straight is a bit of a problem), so I'm not sure whether this will actually help.</p>

<p>I've also considered taking a really long snowboarding holiday (a month?) as to practice consecutively for a long period and hopefully get over my problem (although, if I don't, it might be a very depressing month).</p></li>
<li><p>Going to somewhere with slopes with less incline.</p>

<p>This should get me more comfortable on the board (allowing me to practice slowing down / stopping more safely), and hopefully this also makes me more comfortable at higher speeds.</p>

<p>Makes sense, but I wouldn't even know how to find such a place, beyond just going to different places until I find one.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any advice on my problem or any of my considerations or any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Or am I too concerned about this, as it's just something that comes with time, and if it doesn't, snowboarding just isn't for me?</p>

"The ""four hits"" fault","<p>Let me describe a specific situation:</p>

<p><strong>Team A serves the ball. Team B executes three hits to return it - they pass the ball, set it and then attack. After the attack, the ball touches both the top band of the net and the hands of the blocker (at the same time) and remains on the same part of the court.</strong></p>

<p>My question is: In such a situation, <strong>is team B now entitled to another three hits</strong>?</p>

<p>To me it seems they should be, for an oponent player was in contact with the ball.</p>

<p>Some other people around believe the oposite, specifically because of the contact of the ball with the top band of the net after the attack.</p>

"How to choose overgrip to a tennis racket?","<p>My tennis couch said that I should test as many overgrips as possible to find a grip which does not get slippery so fast and maintain the condition for a longer period. I tested Gamma overgrip that got slippery very fast and I had to change it after four training periods. Before that I had Wilson but in different racket so I am unsure about their differences. I am not sure whether finding the overgrip is the key here, it may be that a poor undergrip makes the grip go worse faster. I use overgrip because of the larger handle and it helps to keep the racket not sliding easily out of my hand.</p>

  <p>In Game 2, Crosby did not score but he did win 17 of 24 faceoffs, including the game's biggest that earned him a secondary assist on the winner. He is 26-for-40 in the faceoff circle through the first two games of the series.</p>

"Inline wheels wobble","<p>I have been playing inline hockey for 15+ years but only recently made a switch from goalie to skater. I had not skated on a team since I was about 12 years old. I only play recreationally, so not wanting to spend much money, I found a pair of used skates that seem to be in good condition. However, when taking a sharp turn at high speeds they start to wobble. It is hard to pinpoint where the wobble originates, as sometimes it feels more towards the front and other times towards the middle wheels. I believe it had occurred on both sides. They could stand to be rotated but aren't terribly imbalanced. Is this an issue of quality with a particular part of the wheels? The chassis? How I am turning? This takes away an advantage of my natural speed, and I would very much like to get to the bottom of this.</p>

"Is it a fault: penetrate under the net when the feet are completely in opponent's space, but not on the court?","<p><em>It is easier to watch <a href=""https://vk.com/volleyball_vk?w=wall-25176770_599246"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>this video</strong></a> (vk.com, Russian social network) than explain</em></p>

<p>Libero of Sada Cruzeiro flew to the opponent's side but <strong>didn't touch the court</strong> with his feet. At the same time, his feet were in the opponent's <strong>space</strong> completely.</p>

<p>Rules allow this, in these sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>11.2.1 - allow penetrating</li>
<li>11.2.2.1 - allow touching with a foot</li>
<li>11.2.2.2 - allow touching with any part of the body (excepting feet)</li>
</ul>

<p>But also Rules has this fault-section, verbatim (but with my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>11.4.3 A player’s foot (feet) penetrates completely into the opponent's <strong>court</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>So, the question is: Am I right, that in the considered case libero didn't penetrate into the opponent's <em>court</em>? There could be other errors, but <strong>the main point of the question is libero's feet</strong>: they are in the opponent's space (assume, they don't touch the court). Is this a violation?</p>

"Would it make sense for some teams to ""extend"" the terms of qualifying offers?","<p>A ""qualifying offer"" is the market's way of determining which free agents should carry draft pick compensation. The amount for this year is $17.4 million, I believe. If a team extends this to a free agent, and he declines, the team gets draft pick compensation.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the team gets an earlier compensating draft pick if the player signs for more than, rather than less than, $50 million. If a team was willing to make a one year offer of $17.4 million, perhaps that team might be willing to make an offer of that amount for three years, which would take the contract over $50 million. Assuming that the team isn't worried about ""decline"" issues (say for a player in the late 20s or early 30s), would it make sense for a team to follow up with a three year offer to induce other teams to meet the $50 million threshold? The kind of person I was thinking of was Alex Cobb, of the Tampa Bay Rays, a small market (and budget) team?</p>

"Tennis ATP World Tour Finals Scheduling","<p>My question is to ask how the scheduling for the WTFs is done. I understand the grouping. There is Group A and Group B with the following properties: seed 1 is assigned A or B uniformly at random (50-50 probability), and seed 2 goes in the other; repeat this for pairs (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8). However, how are the matches scheduled?</p>

<p>Specifically, is the case that, in each of the groups, the first match the top player plays is against the bottom, and the two middle play each other. Looking through the history, I see that since 2009 this has been the case since 2009 (at least), with the exception of 2013 (when seed 5 played 7 to open up).</p>

<p>It's possible that there was some reason for it not happening this one year, or maybe it's just that 8 out of 9 years this has happened! (Note that it happened in <em>both</em> groups for all years except for 2013, and <em>neither</em> group in 2013.)</p>

<p>Does anyone have any <strong>evidence</strong> to suggest what the answer to this is? I'm not interested in unfounded hypotheses, but actual evidence, such as ""too unlikely"" on a small sample. (For example, at one point Djokovic was drawn in the same half as Federer in 17 out of 21 grand slams -- but these <em>are</em> done randomly, this was just an exceptional event.)</p>

"What happens after the penalty if a player is snookered behind a free ball?","<p>What happens after the penalty is applied when a player is snookered behind a free ball? This question pertains to the rule when a free ball has been nominated, but the player not only fails to sink the free ball, but also snookers the other player with it. In that case the rule says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not potting the free ball incurs no penalty, so the striker may play a

  achieved by having the free ball obstructing the ball on, then the
  strike is a foul and a penalty of the value of the ball on is awarded
  to the opponent.</p>

<p>Okay, but that still leaves the player snookered. For example, let's imagine Player A has a free ball and nominates the green ball. He snookers the cue ball behind the green.

  <ol>
  <li>For a tackle to occur, the ball-carrier is held and brought to
  ground by one or more opponents. </li>
  <li>Being brought to ground means that the ball-carrier is lying, sitting or has at least one knee on the ground or on another player
  who is on the ground.</li>
  <li>Being held means that a tackler must continue holding the ball-carrier until the ball-carrier is on the ground.</li>

It was like nothing I've ever experienced before on a long run, I couldn't run anywhere near my target pace, my effort levels felt quite high yet my km splits were >6 mins/km. At 25.6 km I gave up and ended my run. I realised afterwards, that I must've hit the notorious 'wall'. I didn't have a very good pre run breakfast. I had three High5 ISO Gels throughout the run (aim was to have one every 10k).</p>

<p>After the disastrous run last Sunday, I decided to attempt a 35k again today. This time I had a substantial breakfast around three hours before my run; 4 weetabixes and half a banana around an hour before I set out. Also sipped on water in the hours leading upto it. I knew I was well hydrated based on pee colour.</p>

<p>I set off with the aim of going at an easier pace than my previous long runs. Kept the effort level relatively low and I felt quite good after an opening rough 5k. Had gels every 10km and overall I felt a lot better at the 21K stage than last week.</p>

<p>However I started experiencing the same problems as last week at the 25k mark. I could feel the pace slipping away and it became physically and mentally very tough just to keep running regardless of the pace. I gave up at the 27k mark :(</p>

<p>The weather has picked up in London in the past week or so. These are the first long runs I'm doing in the sun and slightly warmer weather, they seem to have a massive impact on my performance. My half marathon PB and 29k were ran on cold, cloudy days.</p>

<p>After every long run, I evaluate my target marathon time based on how the long run felt and the pace I did it at. My initial target time was sub 4:30, this was based on before I did any training. Over the weeks its been mostly at sub 4, but after my half marathon I was entertaining sub 3:45. My last two runs have put to bed any of those target times and I think I'm back to my initial target time of sub 4:30.</p>

<p>Based on my situation, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I deal with the effects of hot weather and minimise any impact on my performance during the marathon?</li>
<li>What fueling strategies would folks recommend? I'm toying with the idea of using Zipvit gels too as they have 51 grams of carbs per sachet.</li>

  <p>Not to be a foot in Capps’ punch bowl, but his pitching on Monday didn’t exactly feature extensive toe-dragging. There didn't appear to be any toe-dragging, actually.

In a game where batters have fractions of a second to react to the ball, this difference can be significant.</p>

"Can a (baseball) ace's record be improved by his ""pitching out of sequence.""","<p>Most teams will use their best starter for Opening Day, the second best on the second day, etc. through the rotation.</p>

<p>Except when other factors intervene; for instance, the White Sox ace Chris Sale pitched the Sox' fourth game, because injuries meant that he wasn't ready for Opening Day. And the Pirates' Francisco Liriano, who pitched Opening Day, took paternity leave and pitched the fourth game of the following series.</p>

<p>My understanding is that while aces are better than ""backenders""on the same team, they don't necessarily have better records, because they pitch against other aces, while backenders pitch against other backenders. Does this hold through a season, or do ""rotational"" factors allow aces to sometimes pitch against backenders? And do aces' win-loss records in fact, improve, when they are pitted against backenders?</p>

"How long can a goalkeeper wait for opponent to come get the ball?","<p>On soccer it is common to see winning teams wasting time. Goalies have their own techniques to run out the clock.</p>

<p>A situation that intrigues me is when a goalkeeper is allowed to get the ball but chooses not to. He places both hands near the ball without touching it. He waits for an opponent to get close enough and then he proceeds to pick up the ball. Thus wasting 5 seconds of everyone's life ;-)</p>

<p>So, every time that a situation like this happens, an opponent runs towards the ball to force the goalkeeper to pick it up. If instead of running towards the ball all the opponents let the keeper run out the clock, how long can a goalie wait before picking up the ball?</p>

<p><code>EDIT</code></p>

<p>I will accept the answer <code>indefinitely</code>, because according to the rules that is the answer to my question.</p>

<p>But I was also interested on the practical effect of such ruling. Are there any real examples of players ever letting the goalie waste as much time as he wanted to? I cannot believe that everyone would just look at each other for 5 min...</p>

"Use of the designated hitter (DH) in the MLB","<p>With the Houston Astros moving to the American League starting in 2013, each league (National and American) will have an even amount of teams (15).  As a result, the <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320&amp;content_id=27435474&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb"">debate</a> regarding designated hitters (DH) is heating up. As it currently stands, the AL uses designated hitters while the NL does not.</p>

<p><strong>Why are designated hitters used in the AL, but not in the NL?</strong> Are there any specific reasons why the AL adopted the rule and/or the NL did not? </p>

<p>One would think that this rule would be used MLB-wide to keep things consistent...rather than having to play by the respective rules of the home team's league during interleague play, when a player gets traded from one team in one league to another team in the other league, etc. However, the <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120806&amp;content_id=36211874&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb"">MLB</a> claims that the DH has become ""a role more than a player.""</p>

<hr>

<h2>History<sub><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter#Background_and_history"">(1)</a></sub></h2>

<p>Pitchers have historcally had low batting averages. In 1973, American League owners voted 8-4 in favor of using a designated hitter to replace a pitcher's at-bat. Since, the AL has generally had a higher batting average than the NL.  The DH was first used in the World Series in 1976 and for even-numbered years until 1985, where the DH would only be used when games were held at an AL team's stadium (<em>when interleague play (NL vs. AL) began in 1997, the DH would be used in the same fashion</em>). These days, the DH position is used for players to rest and take a partial day-off rather than a full-time position. Also, the DH position has diminished the use of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_switch_%28baseball%29"">double switch</a> in the AL, but is still rather prevalent in the NL.</p>

"Can a switch hitter change positions during an at bat?","<p>Just thought about this while playing wiffleball earlier.

"Contact of a player with the net","<p>The FIVB rules state that:</p>

<p><em>(11.3.1)
Contact with the net by a player is not a fault, unless it interferes with the play.</em></p>

<p><em>(11.4.4)
A player interferes with the opponent’s play by (amongst others):</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>touching the top band of the net or the top 80 cm of the antenna during his/her action of playing the ball, or</em> </li>
<li><em>taking support from the net simultaneously with playing the ball, or</em></li>
<li><em>creating an advantage over the opponent by touching the net, or</em></li>
<li><em>making actions which hinder an opponent’s legitimate attempt to
play the ball.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The only criterion that is clear to me here is the one about touching the top band of the net. What exactly does it mean to interefere with the play or to get an advantage over the opponent?</p>

<p>Suppose the following sample situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>An attacker hits the ball and then, while landing back on the court, touches the middle part of the net (not the top band) with his body or with his hand.</li>
<li>Same as before, but this time a blocker touches the net while landing back on the court.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems to me that in all these cases the player would get an advantage in comparison to situations in which they would not touch the net at all, because then they would have to play more carefully and less aggressively, resulting in a less effective hit.</p>

"Are there times when you can ""recycle"" a player in baseball?","<p>In baseball, unlike basketball or football, once a player is removed from the game, he can't be put back into the same game. That is (probably) to prevent a repetition of matchups.</p>

<p>Example: Late in the game, you have a matchup of (lefthanded) batter X against (lefthanded) pitcher A. So the batting team replaces X with a right handed batter Y. The pitching team brings in B, a right handed pitcher. Now the batting team wants to use a left handed batter, but they can't ""recycle"" X. So they either have to use another left handed batter, Z, or let the new, unfavorable matchup stand.</p>

<p>My understanding is that there is an exception involving catchers. That is, if you replace a starting catcher with a second catcher, you can put back the starting catcher. What I'm not sure about is whether this is true generally, or whether it applies only in special situations.</p>

"Is this a held ball (which should have led to a jump ball)?","<p>Please see: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxY47I-pc-Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxY47I-pc-Q</a></p>

<p>Greg Anthony (the commentator) is quite insistent that this should have been a jump ball.  But it looks to me that the ball was not in Hibbert's ""continuous possession"" (as required by the rules, see below). </p>

<p>Instead, it looks like Hibbert went up, Millsap blocked it, ball completely left Hibbert's hands, Hibbert rebounded the blocked shot (albeit while still in the air), and came back down with it (just like you would when getting any rebound). So this shouldn't be a jump ball (and the officials got it right with their no-call). Is my interpretation of the rules correct? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A held ball occurs when two opponents have one or both hands firmly
  on the ball or anytime a defensive player touches the ball causing the
  offensive player to return to the floor with the ball in his
  continuous possession. (<a href=""http://mediacentral.nba.com/media/mediacentral/Official-NBA-Rule-Book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">p. 19 of this PDF</a>)</p>

"What does a Scandinavian Flick/Pendulum Turn physically achieve?","<p>From what I gathered a Pendulum Turn in the context of rallying helps with inducing oversteer, primarily on low-grip surfaces. Many resources explain the technique, but less so what actually makes it efficient. I figure that some advantages are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The initial sideways drift gives more traction than braking in a straight line.</li>
<li>Weight is distributed towards the tires on the side of the corner.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I do not think that this it the primary effect of the technique. So, is the idea of the pendulum, especially in a FWD, that the rear of the car holds the front of the car back (just as the anchor point of a pendulum), thus introducing a moment of inertia towards the corner into the car when the brakes are being released? Also, this would not work in an RWD at all (only if the rear wheels grip faster than the front wheels when releasing the brake)?</p>

<p>Is this what makes it work? Are there any factors missing? A qualitative physical explanation would be great.</p>

"Can you goaltend a shot that won't count?","<p>I was watching a review of the longest shot in NBA history and was reminded of this pretty incredible bucket:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8CS9DVsUA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8CS9DVsUA</a></p>

<p>This video is of the 2015 Boston Celtics attempting an inbounds play against the Indiana Pacers from the opposite baseline with only 1.1 seconds left. The play is to heave the ball across the entire court towards the basket, but it actually goes in the basket instead.</p>

<p>Of course, that shot doesn't actually count. The player, Jae Crowder, is out of bounds on the opposite baseline and you can't score from out of bounds. His intent is to actually pass it to a teammate so they can attempt a shot within the last second+ of time in the half.</p>

<p>But this leads me to my question: this heave has no chance of scoring even if it goes through the basket. Can a player, preferably a player from the team on offense, simply touch the ball, or just straight up catch and dunk the ball despite the fact that it's clearly heading down towards the basket and would otherwise be a goaltending violation if it were a ""normal"" shot?</p>

"Can the home team win an extra-inning baseball game by more than 1 run?","<p>In baseball, I'm wondering how home teams are awarded winning runs. If the visiting team in, say, Inning 10, plates 5 runs, then the home team has the bottom of that inning to match or exceed this number.</p>

<p>But what if this scenario occurs: game is tied in the 10th with the home team up to bat. 1 runner is on base, and the batter launches a home run over the fence. The game is clearly over via a ""walk-off"" at this point, but since the home team doesn't ""need"" 2 runs to win (remember, it's tied), are they only awarded the 1 run from the on-base runner? Or are they given a 2-run win? If it's the former, is the batter then only awarded a single RBI for his stats, thus ""robbing"" him of the extra RBI (in this case, himself)?</p>

"In football, how should the referee deal with possible offside situations involving attacking/defending players off the field of play?","<p>I personally think this is one of the most confusing aspects of the Laws of the Game. In particular, I'm referring to these two paragraphs (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/chapter/31/section/89/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 11.4</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>(Defending players off the field of play)</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>A defending player who leaves the field of play without the referee’s
  permission shall be considered to be on the goal line or touchline for
  the purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the
  defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is
  outside its penalty area. If the player left the field of play
  deliberately, the player must be cautioned when the ball is next out
  of play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>(Attacking players off the field of play)</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be
  involved in active play. If the player re-enters from the goal line
  and becomes involved in play before the next stoppage in play or the
  defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is
  outside its penalty area, the player shall be considered to be
  positioned on the goal line for the purposes of offside. A player who
  deliberately leaves the field of play and re-enters without the
  referee’s permission and is not penalised for offside and gains an
  advantage must be cautioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually have the same two questions for both paragraphs, so they're technically <em>four</em> questions (just in case one or both of these questions have different answers depending on whether we're talking about defending or attacking players being off the field of play):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>is a defending/attacking player still considered to be on a boundary line even after he has re-entered the field of play?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>(This first question stems from the fact that neither paragraph says that re-entering the field of play actually stops this virtual-repositioning-on-the-boundary-lines that otherwise happens for the purposes of offside.</p>

<p>I'm especially curious about this for what concerns attacking players, as this seems to imply that an attacking players who had stepped off the field of play and then got back will still be considered to be a ""ghost player"" in offside position even if five minutes pass and the ball has been kicked around multiple times, as long as play never stopped, and the ball never left the penalty area while being kicked towards the halfway line.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>do these paragraphs apply to defending/attacking players who leave the field of play as part of a playing movement as well?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>(This second question stems from the fact that both paragraphs seem to be about very specific situations, as the first one is about players leaving the field of play without the referee's permission, while the second one is about attacking players leaving for the purposes of not being involved in active play.</p>

<p>While I understand that if a player leaves the field of play with the referee's permission, e.g. because of an injury, it's only natural that he shouldn't be considered for the purposes of offside anymore, Law 11 never touches the important situation of a player leaving the field of play as part of a playing movement as per <a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/chapter/23/section/41/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 3.8</a>, so that I'm unsure about what the referee should do when e.g. an attacking player temporarily leaves the field of play to go past an opponent, or when e.g. a defending player accidentally steps behind their own goal line while defending their goal).</p>

<p>Liz gave up a single and a walk, loading the bases, and then a single for the tying run in the 12th. After pitching a perfect 13th, he gave up the losing run in the 14th because the Pirates couldn't score.</p>

<p>One more consideration: The following day (today) is an off day, giving relievers a chance to rest.</p>

<p>Would a general manager have reason to question a manager for 1) violating the conventional wisdom about right- versus- left handed match ups and 2) NOT playing to win or lose the game in the current inning to spare future relievers? </p>

"Does anyone else modify their golf grip on a per shot basis?","<p>I've found myself modifying my thumb position of my left hand (I swing right) to achieve a fade or a draw.  I think this technically creates a slightly stronger / weaker grip. If I put my thumb on the flag-opposite side of the golf club I find it much easier to drive the ball low and draw it. And the opposite is true for hitting a cut or fade or even flop shots. I literally put the right side of my left thumb on the flag side of the golf club to hit a soft cut or pitch shot.</p>

<p>I also move my left index finger. If I want to drive the ball lower and draw it a little more or even hit a straighter shot I hook my left index finger on the front of the club and push the club into that left index finger to lock it into place.  My left finger is then at least half an inch farther down the shaft than my left thumb.  The reverse is true for a fade.  I move my index finger farther up the shaft. I feel like this has the effect of letting me cup my left wrist easier.</p>

<p>I don't interlock my grip and I overlap my right ring finger on top of my left index finger.</p>

<p>It's definitely helped with my control and consistency while trying to create different types of shots.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever heard of a pro modifying their grip like this on a per shot basis?</p>

<p>Does anyone else do this?</p>

"How exactly did Carvajal not get booked/sent off after causing a penalty?","<p>Juventus-Real Madrid Champions League semi-final game is being played now and I am completely dumbfounded by how Carvajal managed to get away without seeing a card in connection with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3HFZb7XbqY"">penalty situation</a>. </p>

<p>The facts are: </p>

<ul>
<li>It's a sliding tackle, that misses the ball</li>
<li>He is the <strong>last</strong> defender</li>
</ul>

<p>I would have expected a red but even a yellow would be understandable. I can't get my head around the fact that Marcelo got a yellow for his ""tactical"" foul prior to the penalty, and Vidal got a yellow for protest but the player who caused it all seemed to get away with it. </p>

"How were the parameters for a ""quality"" start defined?","<p>A ""quality start"" for a pitcher in baseball is defined as giving up no more than three runs in six or more innings of work. For frames of reference, a starter needs to complete at least five full innings (a majority out of nine) to be eligible for a win, and three runs in six innings would be a 4.50 ERA. So how did this definition come about?</p>

<p>I've worked with a sliding scale, where a ""quality start equivalent"" (QSE) which would require at least five innings of work, and the number of innings minus the number of runs cannot be less than three. That is to say, five innings and two runs would qualify, as would seven innings and four runs. Has anyone in the sport used, or proposed, a similar ""equivalent?"" (On this scale, the Pittsburgh Pirates, who have ""only 16 quality starts in 26 games, would have 20 QSE's. Other teams would benefit from this adjustment, of course but not to the same degree.)</p>

<p>Another thing that puzzles me is that a quality start is ""retracted"" if a starter goes six innings with no more than three runs, then pitches the seventh (and possibly an eighth) and gives up a fourth run. The way I look at it is that the pitcher earned a quality start for ""three in six,"" then functioned as a ""middle reliever,"" for the seventh inning. Put another way, the pitcher gave his manager the option of using only one inning of ""middle"" relief, even though the manager didn't use this option. Or don't the scorers see it that way?</p>

"Scoring runs when a no ball is caught","<p><strong>When a ball is batted in the air and then caught, but it was called a no ball (so they can't be dismissed caught), will the batting team score any regular runs of the ball they completed (and can they potentially be run out)?</strong></p>

<p>Two similar situations happened in two different IPL matches, but was seemingly treated differently.</p>

<p>In ball 19.5 of the second innings of the <a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2015/engine/match/829769.html?innings=2;view=commentary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">32nd IPL 2015 match between Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals</a>, there was a run-out after a no ball was caught (an additional run was also scored, the run-out happened when they attempted a second).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vinay Kumar to Binny, (no ball) 1 run, OUT, another full toss, in the air again and he's caught at long-on. This was definitely over the waist, and is called no-ball. Pollard doesn't realise that and throws the ball late, which makes Southee comes back for the second. But his throw is accurate and Vinay takes the bails off casually, catching Southee's bat short despite the dive. A no ball, a run, a run out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ball 19.4 of the first innings of the <a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2015/engine/match/829743.html?innings=1;view=commentary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">19th IPL 2015 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders</a>, the ball was caught, but replays showed that it was above waist height and it was called a no ball, and in addition a run was scored. This was shown on televsion and CricBuzz and CricInfo.</p>

<p>But then in the innings break the score was adjusted, and as CricInfo says ""The target is 177, not 178. The run taken on the no-ball for height in the last over won't be taken into account as the catch was taken"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UT Yadav to Rahul, 1 no ball, high full toss swung high over midwicket, long on runs in to his right to take it, but replays show that is just above waist height, and it is a no-ball</p>

"Why is a baseball runner ""out"" when you hit him with the throw to first?","<p>A few games ago Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers scooped up a bunt down the first base line and pegged the runner square in the back who was just running straight down the baseline like anyone would.  The runner didn't otherwise in any way impede the defensive players, it was just a mistaken throw that hit the runner.</p>

<p>But the runner was immediately called out.  The first baseman never touched the ball.  Everyone including the announcers just understood it to be an out.  Why?</p>

<p>If a catcher throws down to second base to get a guy trying to steal, and the ball hits the runner, he is not automatically out.  If the guy in right field throws a ball to third base and hits the runner sliding into third, he is not automatically out.  What then is the reasoning and rule that allows the guy running to first to be out?</p>

"How do top football league (e.g. EPL) teams retain reserve players?","<p>Premier division teams in the top European leagues (EPL etc) play a lot of matches, especially the elite teams that also play in UEFA. With player fatigue, injury, suspension etc reserve players must be needed at times. By reserve I mean players beyond the starting eleven plus 3 subs.</p>

<p>My question is who are these players, how good are they and what do they get paid? From the teams perspective, they have plenty of cash and don't want to have to field players who are terrible when their stars are unavailable. But from the players perspective, if you are good enough to occasionally be a sub and get a few minutes for Manchester United, then you are probably good enough to be a starting player for Wolverhampton but then you'd actually get to play full games regularly. Is this about the standard of these reserve players, or are they more like the ability of a regular starter in a lower division?</p>

<p>The main football code I follow is Australian Rugby League and in the top competition (the NRL) each club has a top team but also a reserved grade team that plays in a parallel competition. There is also an under 21s competition which also functions as a type of reserve grade. When top team players are unavailable, someone who has been doing well in reserve grade steps up to the big time and when the top player returns they go back to the reserves but crucially keep getting regular game time. My understanding of European football is that there is not this kind of reserve grade system. So what are the reserve players doing when they are not needed? How do they continue to demonstrate to the manager that they are in form?</p>

2) When the batsman is not given out, the bowling team could review
it.

<p>So for example, it's an <code>LBW</code> given for a batsman, and it's the umpire's call. The batsman tries to review it.

"What does it mean to say, “X was the Nth overall pick for this season”?","<p>I am a recent NFL enthusiast and have just started following the games but some terminology still stumps me. I understand the draft process in general and know that every year each of the 32 teams get to pick new players over two days with 7 rounds given to each of them. So, when a player is said to be the “<strong>first overall pick for a season</strong>, does it mean that he was the first one to be drafted by any team for that year? Or does it mean he was just picked in the first (of the seven rounds) round? If each team gets one pick (ideal circumstances), that would mean 32 picks per round. So could the player (said to be the first overall pick) have been picked in any order as long as it’s in the first round or does he have to strictly be the very first pick of the first round?</p>

"Safe volley grip and serving grip in Tennis?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHh05.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><em>Which is a correct and safe volley grip aka serving grip in Tennis? One where hand is clearly on the handle or the one where some fingers are resting on the handle? Images screenshot from the video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0uSVhqb1mU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>I trained very intensive weeks tennis where my baby finger and ring finger got damaged/painful/non-flexible due to holding the racket so that only 3-4 fingers on the holding -- video about training <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-XAtmPDNk&amp;t=2m40s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> -- this was because I used more the grip where some fingers were not totally on the grip so strong swing put intensive stress to the baby finger and ringer finger. Initially, physiotherapist said that it is only tight muscles so 1 week's rest. Now I realise that my right-hand muscles are far stronger on my holding hand and that the tension is getting lower and morning hardness is becoming less. Yet the feeling in the serving hand is not the same as in the other hand, this may be a good (muscles/bones getting stronger used to playing tennis or I am using a wrong technique). Now I am uncertain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Should I change my serving grip and my volley grip so that all of my fingers are on the handle of the racket (picture on the left) or half finger, one finger or 2 fingers over the handle (picture on the right)?</strong></p>

"Bypassing the salary cap through hidden accounts","<p>I have a general salary cap question. This can be for any league with a cap, but let's use the NFL.</p>

<p>Is there anything preventing an owner from paying a player with a hidden account or something? For example, if a player on the open market can make $10 million and the owner says to the player, ""Take $5 million as your official salary and I will give you $5 million in an offshore bank account."" This saves the player money in taxes and in agent fees and it helps the team to be more competitive because it has more cap room than they normally would.</p>

<p>Is there anything preventing this from happening? Obviously you'd want to limit it to a few star players so word doesn't really get around and you wouldn't want the official salary to be super low or it could be suspicious. </p>

<p>We play volleyball socially and the team is mixed gender, aged 20 - 50+, mixed level (from complete beginners to two advanced players who join us occasionally).</p>

<p>I've been playing for almost two years now. I would rate myself above beginner level.

"Spin in Ice Hockey Shots?","<p>Spin is highly important in professional ball games such as tennis, football (soccer) and basketball. In order to shoot with spin in tennis, you need to have enough flexible hands/arms and learn the proper technique. Spin also helps to score in basketball because side-spinned balls turn more easily to the goal. In football (soccer), spinned shots are highly unpredictable for the goalkeeper and defence, making scoring more probable with the surprise element. Golf balls can travel father away due to spin. Spins are everywhere and its understanding can be a real advantage!</p>

"Scores of men's vs. women's teams","<p>In some sports, two teams compete against each other for a set amount of time (e.g. soccer, basketball) or another fixed quantity (like baseball). In those sports, do men's teams score more points on average (against each other) than women's teams, or vice versa? Or is there not any noticeable difference?</p>

<p>For example, take the last editions of the FIFA (soccer) World Cups for women:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">2015</a> (2.81 goals per match)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">2011</a> (2.69 goals per match)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">2007</a> (3.47 goals per match)</li>
</ul>

<p>and for men:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">2014</a> (2.67 goals per match)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">2010</a> (2.27 goals per match)</li>

</ul>

<p>The women score more goals per match than their male counterparts. Is this common throughout football, or just a coincidence? And how about other sports?</p>

<p><sub>If there are any sports where women's matches last longer/shorter than men's, e.g. 30 minutes instead of 40, I'd expect the statistics to compensate for that; it's really the 'goals per minute' that I'm after.</sub></p>

"Target size for compound archers","<p>I want to shoot targets of the size used in competitions with my compound bow. How big are these?</p>

  <p>The more highly the Bow Weight, is the flight curve of the arrow all the flatter. This is very important with the long haul distances. Beginners must lead itself to the high Bow Weights slowly near.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is the language used, I have a hard time believing the <a href=""http://www.world-of-archery.com/Target_Archery/FITA_Target.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>.</p>

<p>Finding information about what recurve archers shoot at is easy as it's an Olympic discipline. But a 122 cm target at 70 m is absolutely ridiculous for compounds.</p>

<p>The only statement from a reputable source (in proper English) I was able to find is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The compound target is 80cm in diameter with a 10 ring 8cm in diameter. In international competition, compound targets only include the yellow, red and blue rings. This is to reduce the size of target mat needed for each target face, in order that each athlete has their own target to shoot at.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href=""https://worldarchery.org/Target-Archery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://worldarchery.org/Target-Archery</a>)</p>

<p>Is this information correct? Does the outer blue ring have a diameter of 80 cm or would the outer white ring have a diameter of 80 cm if it was there?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After reading World Archery's statement again, I noticed that I should be able to figure this out given the information and graphics they provide on the page I linked to.</p>

<p>I measured the 10 ring of the ""target center"" graphic to be 86 px in diameter and the outer blue ring to be 516 px in diameter.</p>

<p>10 cm / (86 px) * 516 cm = 60 cm</p>

<p>So under the assumption that they are referring to only the ""target center"" when stating that ""[the] compound target is 80cm in diameter"", this leads to a contradiction because 60 cm ≠ 80 cm.</p>

<p>But on the full FITA target they provided, I measured the 10 ring to be 91 px in diameter and the 1 ring to be 905 px in diameter.</p>

<p>10 cm / (91 px) * 905 px = 99.45 cm</p>

<p>This again leads to a contradiction because 99.45 cm ≠ 80 cm.</p>

<p>So even though the information seems to stem from a reputable source, it's ambiguous, has only two interpretations, and both of them contradict other information presented on the same page.</p>

"What is this (basketball) statistic called?","<p>Personally, I am interested in a player's personal contribution to the game. Therefore, I want to compare the team's performance when he is on the field versus when he is not on the field. I believe that it originates from basketball, but it can obviously be extended to other sports.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Suppose a player plays 12 minutes out of a 48 minutes NBA match. In the time he is on the field, the score is 25-20 for his team. In the other 36 minutes, the score is 70-70. So, his team is performing '5 points better per 12 minutes' when he is on the field. After rescaling to full match time, the statistic would be +20 for this player in this hypothetical match.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is there a statistic that describes this effect or any one closely related? If not, could you explain why this statistic is not of interest? Personally, I think it says a lot about a player that cannot be counted explicitly, for example defensive positioning.</p>

"Which edition of rankings is used for which purpose on Grand Slam tournaments?","<p>Rankings are used for several purposes:</p>

</ul>

<p>(See also <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/540/how-do-tennis-players-get-into-tournaments"">How do tennis players get into tournaments?</a>)</p>

<p>Qualifying starts earlier than main tournament. Players sign in for a tournament even earlier. It seems that different version of rankings are used for these purposes.</p>

<p>(I suppose there was nothing happening professionally earlier in South America, so the title really should be in “The Americas” - no?)</p>

<p>Note: the original Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 were professional, but were “barn stormers”, traveling around as a kind of traveling circus, selling tickets and playing locals.  They were 57-0.  That team eventually became the MLB Cincinnati Reds, however, four of the team's players moved to Boston and started a team called the Boston Red Stockings, who changed their name to the Beaneaters, then to the Braves.  Then moved to Milwaukee in 1953, and then Atlanta in 1966.  So the MLB Atlanta Braves also have a kind of secondary claim, since I think one of those four players was the manager of the 1869 team mentioned above – so I'm not sure who “retained rights” of that well documented first (?) professional team.  (Or is there an earlier professional team in another sport?)</p>

Since kid made the interference batsman and umpire lost sight of the ball and they (batsmen) did not finish the third run wondering if the ball was caught by the kid or went to the boundary line. Meanwhile, fielder chasing the ball continued running and pick up the ball, threw it back to the keeper and they made an appeal for the run-out. </p>

<p>Now, fielding side wanted the run out and batting side wanted the penalty 5 runs or to keep 2 runs which occurred before the interference or even redo the ball/delivery. </p>

<p>I've read that a runner cannot score on a third out unless the batter reaches first safely.

  <p>The game is played by two teams of 11 players each. If a snap, free
  kick, or fair-catch kick is made while a team has fewer than 11
  players on the field of play or the end zone, the ball is in play, and
  there is no penalty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Section 5 Position of Players at the Snap, Article 1: Offensive Team</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The offensive team must be in compliance
  with the following at the snap:</p>
  
  <p>(a) It must have seven or more players on its line (3-18); and</p>
  
  <p>(b) All players who are not on the line, other than the receiver of
  the snap under center, must be at least one yard behind it.</p>
  
  <p>(c) No player may be out of bounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first one says that the play can possibly start without all the players within the bounds. The second one says that the formation is considered illegal (penalty) if a player is out of bound.</p>

<p>The question is : what is the difference between an ""out of bound"" player and a player who is not part of the play to begin with ?</p>

"How often do tires need to be changed in Kart Racing?","<p>We are new to karting and are renting a Kart for Racing. Our fee does not include new tires this is something we must pay for if we want to provide new tires.</p>

<p>The existing rear/front tires we use a device to heat scrape off any debris before
the next race.</p>

<p>The person we are renting from says we should replace the front tires in a few more weekends. (each weekend has 4 races) The tires on the Kart now are not new.</p>

<p>We know that tires are expensive 200.00 a pair but want our child to be safe.</p>

<p>How do we know when to replace? 
So we want to know when is the right time to replace. Can we tell by looking? or is it more something our son can tell while racing.</p>

<p>The track is a track that is set up in a parking lot so it has a lot of bumps and is not a normal smooth maintained race track. (although they do blow debris off

"When a QB slides, is it considered a dead ball?","<p>I was watching the Niners-Lions game last week and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYI63ZmEE1c"">saw something that has me a little confused</a>. I was under the impression that when a quarterback slides in the NFL, the play is considered dead when the player hits the ground. In this video, 49er QB Alex Smith starts sliding and then is hit. I know the timing is really close, but it seems like the defender (safety John Wendling) moved after Smith was already going down. In the instance that a player is hit after the play is dead, I thought there was supposed to be a penalty like unnecessary roughness. I haven't been able to find a rule about QB slides anywhere, except some speculation on it. </p>

<p>First, is the play dead after a QB slides, regardless of whether he is hit? Second, if it is dead on the slide, is there a penalty for hitting the QB after the slide?</p>

"When playing ice hockey and giving a pass at the blue line, who should go first?","<p>I didin't know how to clearly express my question, so here are a few explanation.</p>

<p>I'm currently playing in a small hockey club at a quite low level, and we always do this exercise where all the players are at one end of the rink (where the pucks are on the picture). One player on each side rushes to the blue line, only one having the puck. Then, each one crosses the other one behind the blue line, and the one who holds the puck gives it to the other one. Then, they enter the zone and shoot on the goalie. This exercise takes place on only one half of the rink. We often do this at warmup before a play.</p>

<p>So, my question is : which one of the two guys should be the closest to the attack zone when crossing the other one? The puck holder? The receiver?</p>

<p>On the picture, should 1 give it to 2 and wait a bit to avoid an offside, or should 2 give it to 1 for him to enter the zone quickly?</p>

<p>When we play, some say option #1, others say option #2, and it ends up in big ""hugs"" at the blue line, when we bump into each other. ;)</p>

  <p>I was the only guy in the defence line in a free kick when opponent placed his ball. The opponent had massive leg muscles and he was far taller than me. He scored a goal I have never seen in any football game ever, it barely touched the top of my hairs when I tried to hit the ball back with my head. The flight path of the ball was like a whirlpool: it rised just over me, it spinned to the left, it then went down and then again up so that goaltender was totally flabbergasted by the rapid change in the movements of the ball. For me, it looked like a whirlpool shot due to the whirlpool flight path.</p>

"How does the referee communicate with players in football(soccer) matches, when they are from different countries?","<p>I always see in TV referees communicating with the players in international football matches(both club and national competitions).

If so, is it somehow specified as a rule, or just more of a custom?</p>

For instance, in a field of 128, the top seed is matched against the 128th seed in the first round, the number 2 against the 127th, etc. The idea in the first round is to eliminate the bottom 64 players, and most of the ""survivors"" will be seeded 1-64.</p>

"Scoring by offense on a blocked extra point","<p>In American football, if an extra point kick is blocked can the offense pick it up and advance it or recover it in the end zone? Would they score 1 point or two? Does it matter where the ball lands after the block (i.e., passing the line of scrimmage vs. not) before it is picked up? Is it different in the NFL vs. college?</p>

<p>What's triggering this question is the 1-point safety rule. I'm trying to figure out what in the world a defender <em>should</em> do about a ball that lands in or near the end zone on a blocked extra point. Why is there any motivation at all to pick that ball up and try to run with it if they might be tackled in the end zone, giving 1 point to the offense?</p>

"Can a goalkeeper chip the ball to the head of a teammate from a goal kick to circumvent the backpass restriction?","<p>If you've been following the 2019 International Champions Cup, you've certainly not missed Benfica's unorthodox goal kick against Milan (<a href=""https://twitter.com/SjorsvVeen/status/1155587200840544256"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clip on Twitter</a>). If you can't see the video, just know the goalkeeper had a defender stay very close to him, so he could flick the ball to his centre-back, who then headed it back to him so he could pick it up with his hands and resume play more easily.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/46cJV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/46cJV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>Now, I originally thought this would not be allowed, as Law 12 punished whoever uses a trick to circumvent the backpass rule, and the fact there are two offenders instead of just one shouldn't change anything, especially in a case like this where the intent of circumventing the law is clear as day (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/chapter/32/section/94/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 12.3</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player (...) uses a deliberate trick to pass the ball (including from a free kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it appears that several people have contacted the IFAB following this situation, and surprisingly enough they have stated this kind of goal kick is legal. But while it's obviously up to them to decide what constitutes unsporting behaviour (so I can't really complain there), what truly puzzles me is their explanation as to why this should be allowed.</p>

<p>According to many people, including Dale Johnson (<a href=""https://twitter.com/DaleJohnsonESPN/status/1156134912690442242"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to his tweet</a>), the IFAB said this is legal because <em>""[n]o handling backpass Law <strong>was designed to prevent time-wasting</strong> and actions here are <strong>clearly not to waste time</strong>""</em>. This is also confirmed by other tweets which provide screenshots of emails written by David Elleray himself (Technical Director of the IFAB), that again mention the fact that <em>""no law [was] broken""</em>, and that <em>""game [was] <strong>restarted quickly</strong>""</em> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/KirkshawsColts/status/1156442448597606400"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to tweet</a>, image below).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u42HM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u42HM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, let's consider that sentence from Law 12 again, the one that punishes trickery; it's considered unsporting behaviour, meaning that something about it is against the spirit of the game. This <em>""something""</em> can only be one of these two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the unfair action is trying to circumvent the Laws, <strong><em>OR</em></strong></li>
<li>it is specifically going against the spirit of the backpass law.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if the correct answer were the first one, this means that <em>any</em> attempt to circumvent a rule could result in a yellow card (remember that the list of unsporting behaviour offences is a mere list of <strong><em>examples</em></strong>, which could be expanded to include any other act or behaviour the referee deems to be just as unfair), which would then clearly include this situation as well. Yet the email in that screenshot clearly states that <em>""no Law [was] broken""</em>, which means this can't be the correct interpretation; I've heard the IFAB also likened this situation (but sadly I have no screenshots of this) to kicking the ball at an opponent while taking a free kick in order to replay it, which <em>could</em> be seen as a way of circumventing the rules, but is instead—as we all know—permitted by the Laws themselves.</p>

<p>This leaves us with only one possible option: the unfair action behind the no-trickery rule is specifically <strong><em>going against the spirit of the backpass rule</em></strong>—and thanks to the first tweet (but it's also hinted in the email in the screenshot) we know what that spirit is: to prevent time-wasting.</p>

<h2><strong>But then, doesn't it mean that goalkeepers are able to handle most backpasses now?</strong></h2>

<p>Very rarely do goalkeepers feel the need to handle a backpass during a <em>tiki-taka</em> situation: this offence is more often than not called when a defender has no other choice but to kick the ball back to the keeper because he's being pressed by the opponents, and the GK accidentally picks it up with his hands. Yet there's no time-wasting ploy in the situation I just described, is there? It's just a defensive scheme, especially if the goalkeeper immediately throws the ball with his hands like the Benfica GK in the video above. Whistling for a foul here would mean going against the spirit of the law.</p>

<p>And the situation gets even more absurd when you think that <strong><em>if</em></strong> the defender flicked the ball up to his own head and then headed it back to the keeper under the very same circumstances, then <strong>the GK could legally pick it up according to this new interpretation</strong> because they weren't trying to waste time! Which means that if we punish the foul we're applying a rule outside of the scope it was originally intended for, and therefore we're encouraging players to circumvent it in situations where the spirit of the law would not be broken, in which case we're actualy <strong><em>told</em></strong> not to intervene because it would be legal for them to circumvent it!</p>

<p>What do you think of all of this? How should the referee deal with these offences after this groundbreaking new interpretation by the IFAB?</p>

"Consensus on the goalie 'hole' numbering in Hockey?","<p>In ice hockey, it seems fairly well agreed upon that there are 5 main 'holes' to aim for when shooting on the net. Upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right, and between the goalie's legs. </p>

"How are doubles seeds calculated?","<p>For singles, the seeding in the tournaments is rather straightforward: We simply look at the rankings and the players with top 8 (or 16 or 32) rankings are seeded.</p>

<p>However, for doubles competition we cannot use such simple procedure. There are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Rankings"">ATP rankings</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Rankings"">WTA rankings</a> (and, in the case of junior events, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_tennis"">ITF rankings</a>) for doubles. However, the players are ranked individually. For example, it might happen that in a tournament player which is No. 1 in doubles plays together with the player who is No.4. If the players ranked 2nd and 3rd would enter the same tournament, which of these couples would be ranked higher? Or is the seeding somehow calculated based on the number of the points each player have gained?</p>

<p>Similar question can be asked about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_doubles_(tennis)"">mixed doubles</a>. (Although mixed doubles competition is not played at many tournaments. I am only aware Grand Slams, Olympic Games, Hopman Cup and Youth Olympics.) I am unaware of a ranking for mixed doubles. Is the ranking in this case somehow combined from the doubles ATP and WTA rankings?</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on what are couples in doubles competition seeded?</li>
<li>Is the procedure to obtain doubles seeds the same for Grand Slams, ATP tournaments, WTA tournaments, junior tournaments?</li>
<li>What about mixed doubles?</li>

"Who are the other horses and riders alongside Americah Pharoah?","<p>Both before and after the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, I noticed that the horses and jockeys were accompanied by men wearing red vests over white shirts, who were also on horses. They first led the procession to the track, then stayed in the rear while the horses entered the gate.</p>

<p>After the race, one of the men rode alongside Victor Espinoza as American Pharoah cooled down after the race. At first, as I had thought earlier, it seemed that the men were merely there to ensure that everything went fine and the horses went where they were supposed to go. However, I noticed that Espinoza was talking and laughing with the man after the race, and America Pharoah appeared the be nuzzling the other horse, indicating that the two pairs knew each other. That seemed to cast doubt on my first theory.</p>

"Five a side tournament - awarding bye's in a partial round robin","<p>I help to run a five-a-side tournament with my scout group; we tend to have around 40 teams which split across 4 age groups. We can't run full round-robins at the group stage, so instead we run 4 games for each team, award points and put the best teams through to a knockout round.</p>

<p>The fixtures are all pre-arranged the day before, so if a team doesn't show up on the day it's sometimes not possible to avoid the situation where a bye has to be awarded to some of the teams.</p>

<p>In this situation, what's the correct score to award? We award 3 points for a win, 2 for a score draw and 1 for nil-nil. In practice goal difference often decides who goes through to the knockouts.</p>

<p>FWIW my own answer would probably be to award a score draw, which might avoid introducing an unfair advantage without penalising the team for missing a game?</p>

"Usage of unusual characters in sports shirts","<p>Many languages make use of characters outside the standard English A-Z set, and these characters often make it into family names, e.g., <em>Özil</em>, <em>Fàbregas</em>, <em>Čech</em>, <em>Szczęsny</em>, and so forth. Surprisingly (to me), kit manufacturers often produce shirts where the player's name has a special character replaced with the closest approximation within the English A-Z set, e.g.,</p>

<ul>
<li>At Arsenal, Szczęsny's shirt says <em>Szczesny</em>, and this version of the name is even used <a href=""http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/wojciech-szczesny"">in the club's website</a>. Similarly, Čech <a href=""http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/petr-cech"">goes by <em>Cech</em></a>.</li>
<li>Many Iceland players have names with a <em>þ</em> or a <em>ð</em> in them, and then carry shirts where it is replaced with <em>th</em>. For example, Sigþórsson went around the Euro this summer with a shirt that said <em>Sigthorsson</em>. This is also the version of his name in <a href=""http://www.fcnantes.com/groupepro/20152016/fiche.php?numjoueur=143"">his Nantes website</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many such examples can be provided. Effectively, the only special characters that regularly make it into shirts are Germanic umlauts and Spanish/Portuguese accents. This is odd, because the change in spelling often entails a change in pronunciation (e.g., Šmicer's Liverpool shirt used to say <em>Smicer</em>, even though <em>š</em> and <em>s</em> correspond to different sounds; this is like giving Ronaldo a shirt that says <em>Renaldo</em> and then going ""eh, close enough, who cares"").</p>

<p>So  here there are actually two questions. <strong>First</strong>, why do clothing companies systematically produce shirts with known misspellings (unlikely to be economic reasons, I think; the cost of procuring additional characters is probably trivial relative to the size of the market)? And <strong>second</strong>, why do the relevant players systematically tolerate the misspellings?</p>

"Electronic Assistance in baseball","<p>Though I'm curious about this in all sports, I'll limit my question to the scope of MLB for the moment.  My question is what (if any) are the rules regarding electronic assistance in baseball games?  </p>

<p><em>Extrapolation</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong>  Player batting has a ear bud inside his ear that is receiving info from another party in real time about where the catcher is located; what pitch to expect; etc.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Pitcher is wearing ear bud and receiving information about where this player likes pitches, his weak spots, how he does in certain counts; etc.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Manager receives real time data about whether to challenge a call based on a team of people scouring instant replay video.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Scenario 1 seems like it is obviously illegal, and should be.</p>

<p>Scenario 2 is no different than what pitchers do to prepare before games and perhaps between innings;  but it allows for a much finer control on a pitch by pitch basis - and for some reason feels like it should be illegal.</p>

<p>Scenario 3 is legal and practiced.</p>

<p>So with that as background; my question expanded is:</p>

<p><strong>Are there any rules governing this?</strong></p>

<p>If so:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are they?</li>
<li>And given the vast array of potential uses for electronic assistance in the game, what are the guiding principles in determining legality in a given situation?</li>

"Timeout after field goal: when can it be taken?","<p>What is the FIBA rule about taking a timeout after a field goal is made, with no fouls or violations other official intervention? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT added</strong>: I have already read the rules, and in my view they are unclear.</p>

<p><strong>18.2.3.</strong> A time-out opportunity begins when:  </p>

<ul>
<li>For both teams, the ball becomes dead, the game clock is stopped and the official has ended his communication with the scorer's table.  </li>
<li>For both teams, the ball becomes dead following a successful last or only free throw.  </li>
<li><strong>For the non-scoring team, a field goal is scored.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Why is 18.2.8 rule there?</em></strong><br>
18.2.8 would imply  that for the scoring team somehow timeout was possible after scoring without official interruption otherwise a special case for the last 2 minutes isnt needed. 18.2.8 doesnt seem to be a refinement of  18.2.3 It appears to contradict it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>18.2.8. A time-out shall not be permitted to the scoring team when the game clock shows 2:00 minutes or less in the fourth period and in each
  extra period and, following a successful field goal unless an official
  has interrupted the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even harder to understand</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>18.2.3  (...) For both teams, the ball becomes dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how is the ball not dead for both teams ? Art 10 doesnt say anything about dead for 1 and alive for another.</p>

"Result of the game?","<p><strong>Scenario</strong> - Final ball of the match and 2 runs are required to win. A fast bowler is bowling to a batsman who is standing one yard outside the popping crease.
Bowler bowls a yorker which crushes the toes of the batsman, who gets injured and cannot run. He, though somehow keeps his bat in the crease, thereby eliminating a run-out opportunity. The ball, after crushing the toe goes to fine leg. In the meantime, the non striker runs to the strikers end, completes the run, turns back and safely returns to the non strikers end before the ball is thrown back.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> - What is the result of the match?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Has the bowling team won?</strong> -> Though the non striker has reached the strikers end and gone back, the batsman hasnt made any effort to take a run. This is considered as a no run and the bowling team is declared winners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is the game a tie?</strong> -> The non striker has completed two runs whereas the striker has just gone back to the strikers end. The strikers effort is considered as a one-run-short and the two runs that non-striker has run is reduced to a single. This scenario, ties the scores and the match ends in a tie.</p></li>

His momentum carries him into the endzone as he flies through the air, but the collision knocks him over upon landing.

"Why is special case of handball above the shoulder allowed under the revised IFAB rules (2019/2020)?","<p>According to IFAB's recent changes to the rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is usually an offence if a player:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>touches the ball with their hand/arm when:
  
  <ul>
  <li>the hand/arm has made their body unnaturally bigger</li>
  <li>the hand/arm is above/beyond their shoulder level (<strong>unless the player deliberately plays the ball</strong> which then touches their hand/arm)</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Scenario One</strong></p>

<p>If I interpret the rules correctly, this sequence of events <em>usually</em> constitute a handball offence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Player A's arm is above the shoulder, with his back facing the ball. </li>
<li>Player B (could be from either team) plays the ball.</li>
<li>The ball travels and touches player A's arm.</li>
</ol>

<p>It does not matter why Player A's arm was raised above his shoulder. Perhaps, he was sitting on the floor after a tackle left him injured, and he had an arm raised towards his team bench signalling for help.</p>

<p>It also does not matter why Player B played the ball towards Player A's arm.</p>

<p>It is <em>usually</em> a handball since this condition is met: <em>ball touches a player's hand/arm when it is above their shoulder</em>. And he did not deliberately play the ball prior to it touching his arm.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, As long as the ref has not stopped the game, a handball offence should <em>usually</em> be called in the above sequence.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Scenario Two</strong></p>

<p>This is where it gets a little weird:</p>

<ol>
<li>Player A's arm is above the shoulder, with the ball at his feet.</li>
<li>Player A plays the ball deliberately into the air (e.g. he lobs the ball up).</li>
<li>The ball travels vertically up and it touches his arm.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will <strong>NOT</strong> be a handball since the clause in parentheses explicitly excludes the scenario where the player deliberately played the ball prior to the ball touching his hand/arm.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the player did not mean to deliberate handle the ball. Maybe he was trying to lob the ball to a team mate, but poor technique or the wind carried the ball vertically towards his unusual raised arm.</p>

<p>I understand that in an actual game, it is highly unlikely that a player will execute this sequence of events. But why is it allowed?</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't understand why the rules were worded this way. It seems to be allowing a very unusual special case of a player's arm/hand touching the ball, while penalising quite accidental cases.</p>

<p>I think it would have been fine (albeit a little rigid) if the rule makers just left out the part in parentheses. So why did they add this confusing part? What is the motivation behind this special exclusion? What are the examples?</p>

<p>For the receiving team the returner is usually a WR, a CB or even a RB, but what about the other players? They should be able to block for the returner, but I guess the best blocking players (offensive line) are too slow...</p>

"What happens when all the same color balls (solids or stripes) go in on the break?","<p>I played on a pool league (TAP league, 8-ball) a few years ago and some of us pondered what would happen according to the rules if a pool player made either all solids or stripes on the break (but not the 8 ball).  </p>

<p>We figured (with our rules anyway), since any balls made on the break does not automatically determine which color you had to make for that game, then you would be forced to go for whatever the other color was still on the table, essentially putting your opponent on the 8-ball as soon as one was made.  I would figure that either player wouldn't want that situation so they would both most likely choose to stalemate (unless a player was confident they could run the table), but I was wondering if there was any precedent or rule for this situation.  </p>

"Do sports blackout policies exist anywhere outside North America?","<p>As a sports fan, I hate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_%28broadcasting%29"">blackout policies</a>.

<p>Do blackout rules exist anywhere outside North America? I've been looking around and all I've found are rules in Canadian and American leagues. I've found no blackout rules in Europe, Australia, Asia, or otherwise. Am I just not looking in the right places, or do these rules only exist here?</p>

"Is there any concept of 'declaring' an inning in Baseball?","<p>This is a question regarding a somewhat hypothetical situation, but one I have been thinking about quite a bit and can't get my head around.</p>

<p>In Cricket, a team can 'Declare' an innings at any time, ending the innings and allowing the other team to come to bat. This is generally done during test matches, as any game that reaches 5 days in length without both teams completing 2 innings would end in a draw - this means that it is not to a teams advantage to carry on after they have already achieved a heavy lead - it is more important to get the other team in so that they can be bowled out.</p>

<p>In Baseball, however unlikely, it seems to me that it would be possible for a team to just keep batting around the order, hitting a potentially infinite number of runs within an inning if the other teams pitchers were so inept that they just couldn't record any outs.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Can a Baseball team choose to end an innings? Is there any law in place that would allow an umpire to step in and end it? In fact, is there anything at all that can end an innings other than three outs being recorded?</strong></p>

"In 8 ball can a player place the cue ball behind the head string and then directly pot a ball which is also behind the string?","<p><a href=""http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=121&amp;pagetype=rules#3.9"">Section 3.9</a> of the WPA Pool Billiards rules lists <code>Bad Play from Behind the Head String</code> as a standard foul for 8 ball. However, when you actually read <a href=""http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=121&amp;pagetype=rules#6.11"">Section 6.11 Bad Play from Behind the Head String</a>, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the cue ball is in hand behind the head string, and the first
  ball the cue ball contacts is also behind the head string, the shot is
  a foul unless the cue ball crosses the head string before that
  contact. If such a shot is intentional, it is unsportsmanlike conduct.
  The cue ball must either cross the head string or contact a ball in
  front of or on the head string or the shot is a foul, and the cue ball
  is in hand for the following player according to the rules of the
  specific game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this seems like an unfair rule. Assume a scenario where I commit a foul and my opponent has a <code>ball in hand</code> with an easy shot in the kitchen. Is my opponent required to place the ball outside the kitchen just to abide by this rule (or take the other option of taking a long bank shot)? I have never observed this rule being applied in the recent matches of 8 ball pool that I have seen. Is there a different interpretation of this rule?</p>

<p>If I were to frame the rules, I wouldn't have included Section 6.11 as a standard foul for 8 ball, or at the very least I would have added a line saying <em><strong>applies to <code>ball in hand</code> only after a foul committed on the break</strong></em>. As it currently stands there's nothing restricting this rule to the spotting of the cue ball immediately after the break.</p>

"MLB: Gray area concerning runners passing each other rule","<p>I was just watching the cubs - mets game on TV (7/1/15) and in the bottom of the 8th, a bit of a bizarre play transpired, which seemed to stump the umpires and commentators alike. There were runners on 2nd (Daniel Murphy) and 3rd (Ruben Tejada) and 1 out, and Tejada took off to steal home. About half-way between 3rd and home, Tejada turned around and got caught in a rundown. Meanwhile, Murphy took off from 2nd to 3rd, and stayed put on 3rd when he got there (expecting Tejada to get thrown out in the rundown). But the result of the rundown was that Tejada ran back to third, on which Murphy was still standing, and passed through the bag (believing he was out somehow), running <em>behind</em> Murphy and proceeding to get tagged out. The Cubs player then tagged Murphy, standing on 3rd, and the third-base umpire ruled both men out. </p>

<p>However the umpire quickly took back his ruling and went into conference with the other umpires, finally ruling only Tejada out, as he was tagged while behind 3rd base, but ruling Murphy safe at third.</p>

<p>My question is, should Murphy (the <em>following</em> runner) have also been called out for <em>passing</em> Tejada (the <em>preceding</em> runner), when Tejada ran back through third base and behind Murphy before he (Tejada) was tagged out? </p>

<p>I suppose the issue comes down to the wording of the rule concerning runners passing other runners. According to Rule 7.08 (h): ""Any runner is out when: he passes a preceding runner before such runner is out."" </p>

<p>Therefore, should Murphy have been automatically called out when Tejada (still not out) ran behind him, thereby putting Murphy <em>in front of the preceding runner</em> Tejada? Or would Murphy only be considered to have ""passed the preceding runner"" if he himself were to run ahead of Tejada, rather than remaining stationary while Tejada ran behind (or ""unpassed"") Murphy?</p>

<p>There is no mention of that abysmal 1997 performance in the wiki page, but the time indeed appears in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_World_Championships_in_Athletics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_100_metres"" rel=""nofollow"">this list</a> and also in the <a href=""https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/saint-kitts-and-nevis/kim-collins-20646"" rel=""nofollow"">IAAF page</a>.</p>

<p>For me, it's hard to believe that that the record was for a real, normal run. It's also totally inconsistent with the progression timeline of that runner (it would seem credible if it were a 200m run). Does anyone know what really happened?</p>

<p>Others show earnings well below the minimum for playing in NHL games (e.g., $100,000 or such instead of the minimums at the time of playing which were much higher).</p>

<p>Does this minimum only count under certain contracts/conditions? Because I have heard some former NHL players whose earnings were not NHL minimum, yet they've had rocky NHL careers (e.g., up and down from NHL/AHL multiple times).</p>

They wouldn't necessary have to sell tickets but just a way to basically have an open inter team game?</p>

<p>In the second case it was pretty obvious that there would be absolutely no quality of football due to the conditions on the pitch due to erratic behavior of the ball on ""grass"" (terrible bounce, passes getting stuck on puddles, players sliding uncontrollably...)</p>

"Signal for off-side and indirect free kick in association football","<p>In association football, I'm confused as to how the referee is expected to indicate an indirect free kick at the time of the offence. He spots the offence, blows his whistle, and then he needs to indicate which team is awarded the free kick by raising his arm at a 45° angle pointing towards that team's attacking side. At that point, i.e. way before the kick is about to be taken, does he also need to indicate that the free kick is indirect with an arm raised vertically or does he only indicate indirectness when the kick is about to be taken ? I'm assuming he would not raise both arms at once.</p>

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/gs3AxqsG79E?t=45s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This video</a> didn't make that clear to me. My understanding from this video is that the referee would have his arm raised vertically from the moment he awards the free-kick up until when the ball is played and touched by another player. This makes no sense to me since in the meantime the referee might need to deal with objection or wall-placing, or may simply need to wait for a ball to be provided.</p>

<p>I also have the feeling that when an off-side offence is called, the referee signals it differently from other indirect free-kick offences. I can't find a video on Youtube where the referee is actually on the screen at the moment the off-side is called, but I seem to remember that they immediately raise an arm vertically, without indicating which team is awarded the free-kick. Granted, if it's an offside, then there's no confusion. But I'm pretty sure that in other cases, like in an obstruction offence, the referee would indicate which team it goes to, and indicate indirectness later on ?</p>

"What is the origin of the myth that Dutch are good speed skaters because it's a mode of transportation for them?","<p>During the opening ceremony of the current Winter Olympics, NBC presenter Katie Couric commented the following when the delegation from the Netherlands was making their rounds through the stadium:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is probably not a news flash to tell you the Dutch are really, really good at speed skating. All but five of the 110 medals they’ve won have been on the speed skating oval. Now, ‘Why are they so good?’ you may be asking yourselves. Because skating is an important mode of transportation in a city like Amsterdam which sits at sea level. As you all know, it has lots of canals that can freeze in the winters. So, for as long as those canals have existed, the Dutch have skated on them to get from place to place, to race each other, and also to have fun.</p>

<p>I really wonder... what could be the advantages of doping in curling? Curling is not a sport of power, or endurance... they rarely throw the rock full power, and even then, a little bit more or less power will probably still to the job just fine.</p>

<p>So why could a curler be using performance enhancing drugs?</p>

<p>The bib numbers and the results of competitors in the qualification seem fairly well correlated, so I assume they're based on a ranking.

There's the possibility that another Hungarian may have lost the ability to compete in another event, but that's a separate question.</p>

If you know that a shootout is likely, why doesn't one team use their weakest shooter, who would suffer a penalty, to slam into the opposing team's best shooter with the hope of causing a performance-impacting injury? Of course, this would not be a respectable action, but, other than sportsmanship, what reason is there to not field this strategy? Sure the advantage gained for the shootout may be nominal, but even a tiny error in skating or handling can cause a shooter or goalie to miss.</p>

"Details regarding two step rule","<p>If a player is running and bouncing, is he allowed to catch the ball - for simplicity let's assume that he has both feet in the air through all the time interval whose beggining is marked by start of the catching and whose end is marked by the completion of gaining control of the ball - can he take two steps (by this I mean land with his foot A on the ground, and then - without moving the foot A - land with his foot B on the ground, effectively setting both feet on the ground) and then just stand like it, without releasing the ball at all?</p>

<p>The official FIBA rules, <a href=""https://www.fiba.basketball/documents/official-basketball-rules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.fiba.basketball/documents/official-basketball-rules.pdf</a>, reads as follows:</p>

<p>""A player who catches the ball while he is progressing, or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball""</p>

<p>which almost explicitly says that what I described is legal. Yet, I ask this question because I've always been taught that after taking two steps as described above, the rules impose that it is necessary to pass or shoot. So, I'm interested if:</p>

<p>1) it used to be that releasing the ball was necessary under FIBA rules, but after the changes of travelling rules so they would be more similar to NBA, holding the ball (after two steps) became legal,<br>
2) it was always legal and the enforcement of releasing the ball under FIBA rules was just a commonly taught misinterpretation,<br>
3) in fact ""coming to a stop"" here is to be understood in some peculiar way and after taking two steps a player is still obliged to release the ball.</p>

<p>Also, I'd be grateful for answering the above questions in the NBA case, I know that the article concerning travel is largely (or completely) the same as in the FIBA case:</p>

<p><a href=""https://official.nba.com/rule-no-10-violations-and-penalties/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://official.nba.com/rule-no-10-violations-and-penalties/</a>
""A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball.""</p>

<p>but I'm not sure if I understand everything correctly, perhaps the accepted interpretation of these rules is peculiar.</p>

<p>Also, if stop (after two steps) is legal, then what are options for a player remaining in such a stop? Basing on my reading of rules, I'd suppose that a player can pivot with the foot A; lift the feet B; jump and release the ball with two feet. But I'd like to be sure.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB1An.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB1An.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see here I have 8 strikes in the game and 2 of them in the tenth frame. 8 strikes / 10 frames is 80% strike rate, but not when 2 of the strikes are in the tenth frame. 8 strikes / 12 first throw chances for 75%. </p>

<p>How do I figure this out in Excel?</p>

"What happened to Polish football in 2014?","<p>I'm Polish and for my whole life I could just dream of spectacular successes of our national team, like in the 80s. However, about the year 2015 something changed, a lot. Our team started to mean something in the world's football. My question is: <strong>why was so</strong>?</p>

<p>I know Polish players started playing in not-so-shameful European clubs, like Borussia, Bayern, Arsenal and of course it mattered a lot but is it really a concidence that a sufficient number of them played in such clubs and it was enough to form a quite strong national team? In Poland much praise went down on Adam Nawałka, the manager of the team. In fact, his team didn't consist of stars only, he found some players from the Polish league.</p>

<p>Maybe it was money which appeared in the Polish league and infrastructure and level of schooling improved? Maybe Poland for some reason became interesting for foreign headhunters? I've got no idea.</p>

"Two-handed ""attack"" return on a serve?","<p>So I went over the Volleyball Canada rulebook for 2018-2019, but I couldn't find anything about a certain situation that occurs often when I play volleyball with friends/colleagues.</p>

<p>What will sometimes happen is that, during a service, a player on the front-row of the receiving team will jump and return the ball to the serving team by hitting it with both hands at the same time (as if he was trying to ""spike"" it with two hands). We're wondering whether this move is legal or not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is returning a serve from the front row by jumping legal?</li>
<li>Is hitting the ball (in a spike-like motion) with two hands at the same time (contact is made with both hands) legal?</li>
</ul>

<p>If that helps, when this happens, the ball is usually not over the net (net height), but below it. From our point of view, it looks like a full blown ""block"" or ""attack"". Not a receive, nor a set attempt.</p>

"Baseball last inning pinch-hitting/pinch-running loophole?","<p>I was researching pinch hitting and running the other day, ands I thought of a possible loophole that could be used to get a walk off when in a bad situation in baseball. </p>

<p>The premise of the loop hole is pinching all of your best players. To elaborate, you pinch hit the first at-bat of the inning with a better hitter if they are not good at hitting. Then, if they get on base, you pinch run them with a better runner (or stealer, depending on your needs) is they are not good enough at running. Then, repeat until you either win or lose.</p>

<p>Would this loophole work? If it doesn’t, how could it be changed to work?</p>

"Is there such a thing as a ""one way player"" in tennis?","<p>I'll use an example from baseball to illustrate my question. A designated hitter is someone who bats, but is not deployed on the field. In its extreme form, a ""one way player"" would be someone who was one of the best hitters in the game, but could not field as well as a good minor league player. Examples would be David Ortiz or Frank Thomas.</p>

<p>Are there people in tennis who are great servers but who have trouble at returning serve in the later stages of a major event? That is, they will almost never have their serve broken in a given match, but also almost never break serve? Meaning that a large number, if not the majority, of their sets are decided by tiebreakers? </p>

"Basketball shooting percentages while practicing","<p>What is a good percentage for making baskets when practicing/shooting around?</p>

<p>I was told 2 things for shooting by 2 different ppl.  One person said since no one is guarding me when practicing/shooting around, I should make all my shots.  This is very improbable since even the best pro shoots ~90% from the FT line.  Another case in point, even the pros won't hit all their shots when no one is guarding (I think Charles Barkley said something about how impossible it is for Curry to have hit 70 3ptrs in a row during practice or whatever he said during the 2015 playoffs)</p>

<p>Another person told me that when we practice shooting around, if we hit ~70% of our shots, that's good enough.  This makes a little more sense since:</p>

<ol>
<li>We're not perfect and</li>
<li>If someone is guarding us, that percentage will drop, e.g. if I shot 10% from a spot when no one is guarding me, I'll probably be shooting 3% WITH someone guarding me</li>
</ol>

<p>So that brings us to my original question, what is a good percentage to shoot at when practicing so that I know I have decent proficiency from that spot/area?</p>

"How do College Drafts work?","<p>I am not American and this is something I do not understand about sports here in the US, so please bear with me. I know in the US, professional sports teams can't be ""relegated"" to a ""second Division,"" and instead get an earlier pick during the college draft if they perform worse. This makes sense - it allows teams with poor performance to pick themselves up by getting better reinforcements. However, this means potentially worse teams will get the best college players. It seems, then, that being an earlier ""pick"" in the draft is potentially a bad thing for a college athlete, since they will get picked up by a worse team (If I were a college soccer player, for example, I'd prefer to be picked up by Real Madrid than by Betis, theoretically).</p>

<p>This seems like it doesn't make sense - it seems like it would discourage athletic performance in college since players should prefer to be picked up by the teams that are winning championships and not the ones that are struggling.</p>

<p>So, how does it work? Where do the earlier picks in the draft end up, usually? Do the ""worse"" teams pick up the best players and them trade them instantly?</p>

"Relief/Closing pitcher statistics","<p>I was wondering about some of the stats that you regularly see in baseball, and what criteria must be met to achieve such a stat, primarily with the relief and closing pitchers.</p>

<p>I understand that a starting pitcher must go at least 5 innings and leave with his team up at the end of the inning to be considered for the win, however after that I do not quite understand the stats for the pitchers to follow.</p>

<p>To my best knowledge I believe that if the game ever gets tied up again or the winning team drops below the other team's score once the starter is out, they will receive a no decision for their performance, and if the team comes back and retakes the lead, then the pitcher for that inning will be eligible for the win (not sure if there is an innings pitched requirement), while the loss will be awarded to the pitcher that last gives up the lead (regardless of the amount of innings pitched).</p>

<p>The stats that I am wondering about include, saves, holds, and innings pitched requirements for the win in the event that a game gets tied up after the starter leaves. As far as the saves and holds, what are the differences? Is there any requirement for a relief/closing pitcher to get the win once the starter is no longer eligible for it?</p>

"Is there any rule forcing a team to try to win?","<p>The Montreal Canadiens have been eliminated from the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoff contention, but now I cheer against them so they finish at the bottom of the standings, and might get first pick in the draft.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why didn't the jury overturn the decision for Lu Xiaojun's attempt at 177kg at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlifting_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_77_kg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2012 London Olympic Games</a> when he missed the minute countdown due to a ""tactical hiccup""?</p>

  they started the clock and Lu Xiaojun ... oh this is very very
  confusing because Lu Xiaojun's clock started too early there..."" -

<blockquote>
  <p>""...when you follow yourself in weightlifting you have two minutes on
  the clock. He was only given one minute on the clock there because the
  other lifter hasn't come out..."" - commentator #2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Lu Xiaojun wasn't following himself (technically), so he doesn't get two minutes, but was that really an oversight on their part? Just seems like a withdrawal from Lu Haojie should have been more apparent to the coach/everyone. Did Lu Xiaojun's coach think that the timer that was running was for Lu Haojie who silently posted no figure? Right after Lu Haojie's failed attempt at 175kg Lu Xiaojun successfully snatches 175kg, so that'd be 1 minute on the timer after Lu Xiaojun for Lu Haojie (who didn't see the stage), then Lu Xiaojun's 1 minute timer would have started immediately after. How did the coach/anyone not notice that the timer cycled twice first on behalf of Lu Haojie and then reset for Lu Xiaojun? Is this because in the one minute you're allotted you can either post or not post a figure, and that these postings are not immediately apparent? It stands to reason that a ""no post"" should have been made apparent. Why didn't Lu Xiaojun follow himself? What decides the order of lifts? Seriously, isn't this weird? The klaxon sounded on the second cycle for Lu Xiaojun's attempt at 177kg. Why didn't the klaxon sound at the end of Lu Haojie's 1 minute ""no post""?</p>

"Are women allowed to compete in men's division in Olympic Games?","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Are women allowed to compete in men's division in the Olympic Games? So, how is the ""men's division"" officially defined by the IOC? Is it explicitly for men only or is it an ""open division"" which allows women (at least in principle) to participate in the ""men's division"" in the Olympic Games?</p>

<p>If it does depend on the sport, what would be an example where women are allowed in men's division (in principal) and where they are explicitly not allowed?</p>

<p>How did this rule change in the past? </p>

<p>Were there any woman participating in the men's division in the history of the Olympic Games (except riding where no distinction between ""men and ""women"" exist)?</p>

<h2>Some remarks</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Calling a division ""men"" doesn't logically imply that only men many participate. For example at least in Germany I know a lot examples where girls compete in ""boys"" divisions if they are good enough, though the division is called ""boys"". </p></li>
<li><p>This also happens occasionally at more advanced levels, for example in table tennis the female player Li Jiao played in the played in the men's Eredivisie for Dutch club TTV Heerlen and won the championship (see: <a href=""http://results.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=li-jiao-1195210/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://results.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=li-jiao-1195210/index.html</a>). </p></li>
<li><p>Note that the question is about if it is in principle possible. Clearly in lots of sports the difference between men and women is very big. However one might imagine a women who is at mens elite level and wants to participate in mens Olympics for example because in the womens division there are no real competitors for her. So how are the IOC rules formulated, do they allow women in principle to participate in mens divisions?</p></li>

"When advantage is played on a DOGSO situation, and a goal is scored, should the offender always be cautioned?","<p>This question was inspired by something that happened during a Serie A match between Napoli and Milan yesterday. A defender handles the ball to prevent it from crossing the goal line: advantage is played, an opponent shows up, collects the ball and scores (<a href=""http://giphy.com/gifs/SZFHZfURzU7LO"" rel=""nofollow"">here is the relevant GIF</a>). The defender was issued a yellow card. Now I am wondering: <strong>why is it a yellow card instead of a red card?</strong></p>

<p>The way I see it, there is a difference between denying a goal to the opposing team (which can only be done by handling the ball on the goal line) and denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to the opposing team. This said, Law 12 reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution / send off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution / send off must be issued when the ball is next out of play, except when the denial <strong>of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity</strong> results in a goal the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour.
  <em>(<a href=""http://theifab.com/#!/laws/fouls-and-misconduct/chapters/disciplinary-action"" rel=""nofollow"">Law 12</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is NOT relevant to our situation, because the defender denied a goal and not an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. The following paragraph should be applied instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player [...] handles the ball [...] in an <strong>unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal</strong>
  <em>(<a href=""http://theifab.com/#!/laws/fouls-and-misconduct/chapters/disciplinary-action"" rel=""nofollow"">Law 12</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where I am questioning the referee's decision. It should not matter if the attacking team ended up scoring anyway: <em>a goal has still been prevented</em>, because what was scored next was another, different goal. So I think the right decision should have been to let the goal stand, and send the defending player off instead of just cautioning him.</p>

"Blown save when starter is ineligible for a win","<p>I'm parsing some baseball data, so I need to be able to appropriately award saves, blown saves, holds, etc. In doing so, I came across some examples that I'm unsure how to handle.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Suppose Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches into the 8th, when he gives up the tying run. <strong>Is Billy charged with a blown save?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Suppose pitcher Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches a scoreless 5th and 6th. The score is unchanged when Charlie comes in in the 7th, and allows the tying run. <strong>Is Charlie charged with a blown save?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Suppose pitcher Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches a scoreless 5th. The score is unchanged when Charlie comes in in the 6th, and he pitches a scoreless 6th, 7th, and 8th. It is still a 1 run game when David comes in in the 9th, and records a scoreless 9th. <strong>Could the official scorer determine that Charlie deserves the win (hence David gets a save), while Billy gets a hold?</strong></p>

<p><strong>My intuition:</strong> 1) No, because there is no other pitcher eligible to receive the win. Hence, it's not truly a save situation, and Billy can't be charged with a blown save. 2) Yes, because Billy could be assigned the win, thus Charlie would have entered in a save situation. Therefore, he would be charged with a blown save. 3) No, it doesn't make any sense for a pitcher to get a hold and the pitcher that relieves him gets a win when their team does not surrender their lead.</p>

<p>In yesterday's match Ecuador - France, around the 49th minute a situation occured that looked to me like this (see <a href=""http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186515/index.html"">this FIFA ""highlights""</a> video from second 41):</p>

<ul>
<li>Player Y (yellow) has played the ball and is running after it.</li>
<li>Player W (white) throws himself, feet first, towards the ball (and Y's running direction), perpendicularly and with no chance of controlling the ball, but some chance of reaching it and changing its direction.</li>
<li>Player Y, with coming W into his way, seems to slowdown slightly, but still extends one leg towards the ball, reaching it the same time as W. His foot lands on the ball, slides off it, lands on W's knee, potentially injuring him.</li>
<li>After some time for treatment of W, referee sends Y off (red card), to no protests from him or his team (presumably the scene has been replayed in super-slow motion several times on screens in the stadium by then).</li>
</ul>

<p>But what was Y supposed to do in that situation? If he had tried to get his front leg onto the grass, given W's momentum it would have ended up under him and Y would have fallen over him with no chance of using his legs to soften the fall (unless risking stepping onto W with the other leg).</p>

<p>Extending his leg further in hope of landing past W would mean risking injury to this leg (and falling anyway, too). Note that this was a split-second decision to take.</p>

<p>I realize it would have been the gentleman-ly thing to do to take the harder fall, but either way I look at it, W's action should have knocked Y off his feet. Why is this not a foul?</p>

"Does football (soccer) require more calories than running?","<p>Michael Bradley of the US team leads all athletes in <a href=""http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/players/distance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""distance covered"" during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup</a> with 38 km (23.6 mi) in 270 minutes of play. That's about 8 mi per game (90 min), for an average speed of 5.33 mph.</p>

<p><strong>How much more calories does football (soccer) burn per mile compared to running?</strong> Is it considerably more exhausting than running for 90 min straight at 5.33 mph? </p>

<p>I would think yes, considering Bradley and other players are in fact sprinting and resting (more tiring, I think, than medium-distance jogging), plus constantly shifting directions, which I assume requires more calories than running straight ahead <sup>(citation needed)</sup>.</p>

<p>But is the ""distance covered"" metric measured this way actually analogous to running? Is 8 miles on the soccer pitch equivalent to some greater distance on a racetrack?  What's the conversion rate for ""distance covered"" in soccer vs. running?</p>

<p>How much more or less calorically expensive is soccer than running?</p>

"How changing tennis balls influence players using serve and volley?","<p>I have heard on several occasions from TV commentators that the tennis balls are now faster, which means that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_and_volley"" rel=""nofollow"">serve and volley</a>, once typical for grass court, is much less common nowadays. I have also read similar claims in some internet discussions.</p>

<p>Could someone explain this in a layman's terms? Basically I would like to ask, for example, about things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>How and why has the speed of balls changed? Does ATP/WTA/ITF give some regulations about types of balls used in their tournaments?</li>
  <li>How does this influence whether player can use serve and volley style? (For example, do changes in racket technology influence this?  What about changes of the grass? Do players physical abilities have also some bearings on this?)</li>
  <li>Are there some other reasons why serve and volley is becoming less common?</li>

"Change of strike in case of batsman is bowled?","<p>Our bowler banged it in short of length, in line with the off stump, and the batsman swings across the line sending the ball straight up over the pitch. Both batsmen immediately set off for the run and the wicket keeper stepped in the middle of the pitch to take the catch. The keeper was so bad at the catch attempt that the ball, which had a lot of back spin on it, went straight through his outstretched hands without making any contact whatsoever, and rolled back and hit the stumps all by itself. By this time the runner had reached the batting crease and he just stood there calmly watching the ball come back and hit the stumps. The striker was given out - bowled. Pretty straight forward isn't it?</p>

<p>But my question is: do you consider that the batsmen had crossed for this wicket, even though the striker was bowled?</p>

<p>The new batsman ended up taking strike in the middle of the over in this case. But I cannot find anything in the MCC rules that refers to change of strike with respect to someone being bowled out. What do you think? Or by any freak chance has anyone seen this before?</p>

"Who should sit out when a social sporting team has too many players available?","<p>I am midway through a season of indoor cricket having put together, organised and captained a new team at the start of this season. Initially it was a struggle getting enough players together to be able to enter a team and we played undermanned for the first few games which in any 6 a side sport, especially indoor cricket, is a huge disadvantage and can be quiet demoralising.</p>

<p>This is a social comp/team and everyone has work and family commitments that make them unavailable from time to time, some more than others.</p>

<p>Originally I told everyone that I'd try and share the games around so that if we had more players than needed available on a given week, the player who had played less games would get a go. However we are now in the situation in which the players who have played more games are the ones who have been with the team ""through thick and thin"" having to cope with playing undermanned, which also costs them money since the indoor centre charges a flat rate per team per game. Other players have been unavailable less often and so have played less games but also therefore haven't had to put in the hard yards of building the team and making sure it could get off the ground. All of a sudden everyone seems available and I'm left having to work out who (potentially myself included) will have to miss games.</p>

<p>So, what is the standard etiquette in social sport in this situation? Should loyalty be rewarded or does fairness dictate the number of games be made as equal as possible for all players? Note that no one has done anything wrong by being unavailable, just that everyone has different levels of commitments to other things.</p>

<p>Edit: I should point out, for those unfamiliar with cricket, that substitutes are not possible in any form of cricket including indoor cricket. The logical option of sharing game time that is possible in most other sports is not an option in cricket.</p>

"Earned v. Unearned Run Following an Error (Dropped Foul Ball)","<p>Suppose that Paul the pitcher begins an inning by striking out Adam, and then he walks Billy. The next batter is Charlie, who hits a foul ball that the first baseman drops. Subsequently, he is charged with an error on the play. Charlie proceeds to hit a home run. Paul concludes the inning by striking out David and Ed. </p>

<p>How does this inning get scored in terms of earned v. unearned runs? Clearly, Charlie's run is unearned because of the error. But what about Billy's run? </p>

<p>I would assume that there are 3 options available for the official scorer: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Ignore the end result of Charlie's at bat (the homer, which implies
  Billy's run is unearned). </p>
  
  <p>2) Assume that the next hitter (David) would have the same end result
  as Charlie (i.e., David would hit a homer, which implies Billy's run
  is earned). </p>
  
  <p>3) Which ever approach is more favourable for the pitcher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would the answer change if instead of David and Ed striking out, David hit a triple (which would have scored Billy had the foul ball been caught), and then Ed and Fred strikeout? My guess is that the scorer would take approach 1, assume Charlie was actually out, and proceed from there.</p>

"Appeal play after a pitching change","<p>Is it possible to appeal a tag-up play at a base after a pitching change?  If so, how does it affect the pitchers' statistics?</p>

<p>For a concrete example, suppose P1 is pitching, runner R3 at third, one out.  Batter B hits a fly ball which is caught by the left fielder (two out).  Runner R3 advances to home.  Now pitcher P1 is removed and replaced with P2.  After the pitching change, but before P2 pitches to the next batter, the defense realizes that R3 left third before the fly ball was caught.  P2 throws to third to appeal.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Will R3 be called out, or is it too late to appeal?</p></li>
<li><p>If R3 is out, who is credited with the corresponding 1/3 inning pitched?  P1 or P2?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose this is the last out of the game in a save situation.  Who gets the save?</p></li>

"Zero-pitch save","<p>It occasionally happens that a pitcher will earn a save by throwing one pitch.  For example, he is brought in with two outs in the ninth and a two-run lead, and his first pitch is popped up.</p>

<p>In principle, it should be possible for a pitcher to earn a save without throwing a pitch at all.  For instance, he could pick off a runner.  We could also imagine more exotic situations: a runner abandons the base paths, or the batter attempts to use an illegal bat.</p>

<p>Has this ever happened?</p>

<p>Instances in MLB would be most interesting, but other leagues would be interesting also.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://techreport.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=43567"">this forum post</a> someone suggested that Mitch Williams did this in 1989 or 1990.  It looks like they are thinking of September 11, 1989, where according to the <a href=""http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN198909110.shtml"">box score</a>, Williams did earn a one-out save by picking off a runner.

"Can a player get his second yellow card while being replaced? What happens then?","<p>In football, a yellow card can be given to a player when he/she is losing time on purpose.</p>

<p>Typically, a team wining the match will make changes on the last minutes to lose some extra time: the player will make sure to be far away from the bench, so that the distance to cover will be quite big. Also, he will walk all the way, making the other team feel very nervous for it.</p>

<p>For this, 30 seconds are summed to the extra time to be added to the end of the match. However, in many cases this change takes way more than this.</p>

<p>I was wondering: would it be possible for a player that is being replaced already having a yellow card to get another one for being so slow during the replacement? Would the replacement then be cancelled? Has it ever happened?</p>

The previous kicker I had I could never operate during a race properly, but now I can, and my question is: <strong>what is the best way to learn how to use a kicker properly?</strong></p>

<p>I know that in very light wind it should be tight to flatten the sail, making it easier for the weak wind stream to attach to the sail, off in medium wind which has more power to pull the rounder sail forward, and tight again in strong wind to depower the sail. But how do I go beyond that? How can I best learn to match a sail shape to the wind condition, and then achieve that shape with the kicker?</p>

"Shall I always stick to the same move if it works?","<p>I play basketball and my strongest move is right hand hook shot. I comfortably shoot over 50%. I hit even better if I shoot from left using the board. I can finish a post move this way, but also do a running hook shot.</p>

<p>For some reason though, I can never force myself to do it again and again. Even after 3 successful shots in a row, I try to change my next offensive move. I interrupt the hook shot with a fake (defender does not go for it) and try to go under anyway. Or I turn into the hook shot but immediately turn the other way and try a fade-away shot. Or just shoot from the line. All these other moves give me worse shooting percentage.</p>

<p>I think, that I worry too much, that the game will become boring for the others. Is it a valid concern? Or shall I just ""play to win""?
Regarding tactics and development, is there any reason to abandon a move that works and force myself to try different moves?</p>

"Is there a stat or resource that tracks series-wins in MLB?","<p>Major League Baseball could obviously never have a team go undefeated (actually, I found out it <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/13954/what-team-has-shortest-longest-losing-streak-within-a-season-in-mlb-history/13955#13955"">did happen in 1869</a>, so from now on let's just go with the live-ball era forward) because of the large amount of games played each season. The best in recent history were the '01 Mariners, who won close to 75% of their games. So on any given day the worst team can, and fairly often does, beat the best team.</p>

<p>To me it seems like the closest a team could ever get to ""undefeated"" would be to win (or at least tie?) every series in the season. For example, taking 2 out of 3 games against the Red Sox, then 3 out of 4 against the Orioles, and so on. In this specific case total wins isn't relevant.</p>

<p>As an example I just quickly went through the wins-losses for the 2015 Cardinals. They played in 51 different series. Of those they won 32, lost 15, and tied 4. Depending on how you look at it their percentage of series won would be .638, or their percentage of series not lost (wins + ties) would be .706. In either case that percentage is not <em>too different</em> than the winning percentage of total games .617 (100 wins). So I'm not too surprised, because this is the type of data I would guess is pretty normal.</p>

<p>What I'm curious to know is about anomalies such as a team winning ~60% of their games while managing to win 90%, or more, of the series played by remaining consistent. The thought of tie-breakers sparked this curiosity.</p>

<p>I'm calling this ""series-wins"" for a lack of better term. Is there an actual statistic for this? Or better yet is there a resource that keeps track of this? I have tried searching, but can't seem to find anything.</p>

"In American Football, why are fullbacks called such if they aren't all the way back from the OLine?","<p>Maybe this question is outdated for modern football so I can delete if needed but why is the fullback called a fullback when they aren't all the way back from the O-line?</p>

<p>I don't have a source on me but I remember reading a book on football like 25-30 yrs ago and it said something like on offense, the QB is 1/4 back from the line, the HB is 1/2 from the line, and the FB is all the way back from the line.  1/4 or 1/2 of what distance, I don't remember but that was the explanation.</p>

<p>At this time (early to mid 80s), there were great runners who were listed as FB (Roger Craig, John Riggins, Franco Harris).  Towards the late 80s-earlier 90s, the FB turned into a lead blocker for the HB and didn't carry the ball much (Mike Alstott, Daryl Johnston, Tom Rathman, etc.)</p>

<p>I'm just wondering why didn't they call lead blockers HBs at this point in time since they were between the RB/FB and the QB?  This might be a moot question now since everyone is taking the FB out for another WR or TE but still a interesting question to me after reflecting back on the evolution of American football.</p>

"What makes Stealing Signs wrong?","<p>My question pertains mostly to baseball, but I imagine it is just as relevant in other sports as well. Every so often I hear about a disgruntled team, accusing the other team of stealing signs. I don't get it. What actually makes it wrong?</p>

<p>This just seems like any other aspect of the competition that is fair game. For example, if a pitcher inadvertently ""tips"" his pitches, and the other team is smart enough to pick up on it and use that knowledge to their advantage, then it is generally considered a flaw of the pitcher. It is now his responsibility to correct the problem, and improve his skills by becoming more deceptive and unpredictable. I wouldn't blame the opposing team for cheating; I would say they played smart baseball. I'm having a hard time understanding how ""decrypting"" signals is any different?</p>

<p>Additionally, the coach who creates the signals does so with the intention to obfuscate them as much as possible. Obviously this is to maximize competitive advantage. So does that not <em>imply competition</em> even within this narrow aspect of the game?</p>

<p>Someone help me out please. What makes stealing signs wrong that teams rightfully take exception and feel cheated?</p>

"In table tennis, why is a ball that hits the edge considered in?","<p>The answer to <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/3801/is-hitting-the-side-of-the-table-legal"">this question</a> states that a ball that hits any part of the top of the table (including the edge) is considered in-bounds.</p>

<p>My question is <em>why</em> is a ball that hits the edge (and bounces off the table in a manner that could be nearly impossible to return) considered in-bounds?</p>

<p>On all of the ping pong tables I've seen in people's homes, the white lines along the edges do not actually touch the edge of the table.  There is about 2-3 millimeters of space between the white line and the edge of the table.  This means that if a ball hits the edge of the table, it has landed beyond the white line and therefore should be considered out of bounds.  If it is still considered in-bounds, then there is no point in having those white lines along the edges.</p>

<p>Do the tables used in ITTF matches have their white lines touching the edge?  If so, then it makes sense for edge balls to be considered in-bounds.  But if their tables have space between the edge and the white line, then it is illogical for edge balls to be considered in-bounds.</p>

"Why do baseball managers argue with umpires in situations where they know it won't help?","<p>As I understand it, in baseball, some subset of the calls made by an umpire are open for review, at the request of one of the team's managers. In those cases, the managers are allowed to leave the dugout and question the correctness of the call. At that point, they can ask the umpire to either officially review the call (which each team has a set number of), or the umpire may decide to voluntarily review it under their own discretion.</p>

<p>However, ""judgement"" calls by an umpire, such as balls and strikes calls, are not review-able. A player or manager arguing with an umpire over such calls can quickly lead to an ejection.</p>

<p>I can understand e.g. a player at the plate, in the heat of the moment, mouthing off to the plate umpire when they disagree, but for a manager to come out of the dugout and argue <em>knowing</em> they're going to get ejected seems odd. Frequently I will even hear the commentary team speculate that being ejected was the <em>intent</em> of the manager.</p>

<p>So, why do managers argue over these calls when it's always fruitless? <em>Is</em> it always fruitless (e.g. do umpires ever reverse ball/strike calls)? Or is there some reason a manager would want to be ejected from a game?</p>

"Can a baseball runner lead off of first in a direct line to the pitcher?","<p>I believe that a base runner is allowed to make their own base line when running the bases.  I don't believe that there is anything in the rules that prevents a base runner from running all the way out in to the outfield when going from first to second base (as long as they are not trying to evade a tag).  I believe that runners are only called for ""running out of the base line"" when they are trying to evade a tag.  And that the ""base line"" is the line that the runner creates when he runs from one base to another.  So for example - I don't believe that it is against the rules for a runner to start at first base then run out in to right field and then run to second base.  As soon as a fielder is making an attept to tag the runner that runner is now required to run in a direct line either back to first or continue on to second base.  And that is when they are not allowed to deviate more than 3 feet in either direction.</p>

<p>So with all of that said - I had a thought today.  When a baserunner is leading off of first base could that runner move off of the base in a direct line with the pitcher?  I know it would be sort of a disadvantage in terms of getting a lead towards second since the runner would be moving out towards the pitcher in to the infield grass.  But it would make picking the runner off virtually impossible.  Any throw from the pitcher back to first base would almost certainly hit the runner.  And the runner could always go back to first standing up which would almost always get in the way of the throw back to first.</p>

<p>I know it would be odd to see a runner leading off of first and standing in the infield grass about 3 strides off of the bag.  But it would seem like you could almost guarantee that you wouldn't get picked off.  And any attempt by the pitcher to throw over to first would be very risky and probably end up with a throw that hits off of the runner.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Is this legal?</p>

However, only in basketball games music is played while the game is in live action. In the NHL music is usually played during breaks and before the puck drops, and in the MLB it's in between the innings or during the few seconds a new batter steps in to the box; the game is not in play in any of those events. The only other time you might here music is during chants - for the purpose of this question let's ignore that as music.</p>

"How do you make 100 free throws in a row?","<p>One day during shooting I thought about how many consecutive free throws I could make. It ended in a bet (mainly with myself) that I could do 100 in a row by the end of the season. Working on that goal on and off for a few weeks, I realized that it is hard but still possible. I made 29 consecutive on day one and since then improved to 38. That does not seem like a big improvement, but the number of longer streaks increased a lot and it definitely helped improve my form and my overall shooting.</p>

<p>As I expected, it's more of a ""mind game"". The challenge seems to be to stay concentrated doing the repetitive task of shooting a free throw for at least fifteen minutes without losing focus. Every time my mind wanders for just a brief moment, chances are I miss the next shot.</p>

<p>My question is, how do pro athletes (from whatever sport) deal with problems like that? I watched the World Darts Championships recently. On that level many of the throws are <em>easy</em> (theoretically). The challenge is more to score consistently under pressure over the duration of a match. I guess the same is true in many other sports where precision is important. Once you mastered the technique, how do you fade out everything else and repeat that same move over and over again without losing focus and precision?</p>

"Interpretation for sequence of slugging percentages","<p>This is really more of a mathematical question with a baseball application, but it seems more appropriate to ask it here. </p>

<p>Because slugging percentage is defined as total bases divided by at bats, it does not appear to be meaningful to describe it in the sense of a probability. In contrast, a batting average is easily described as a probability and the complementary probability is also meaningful. Suppose that we're given batters A and B with batting averages of 0.300 and 0.280, resp., the product of the averages (0.300*0.280 = 0.084) describes the probability that both batters get a hit, assuming that at bats are independent. Similarly, the product of the complements (0.700*0.720 = 0.504) describes the probability that both are out. Lastly, the probability that exactly one of the batters gets a hit is given by 0.300*0.720 + 0.700*0.280 = 0.412. </p>

<p>But if I'm interested in slugging percentages, what would the interpretation be for a product of slugging percentages? Similarly, I assume that the complement of a slugging percentage would be 4-slg?</p>

"does steal count as first bounce?","<p>It is also a well-known rule that if you have just received the ball, you can bounce it but if after you take it with both hands, you cannot bounce it again and you must either shot or pass it.</p>

"Should I give unsolicited playing advice to strangers?","<p>I happened to walk by a man and woman casually playing informal unscored tennis, somewhat above beginner level, at a local park.  It was immediately obvious the woman was waiting far too long before beginning her strokes, basically letting the ball almost reach her, even at the baseline, then attempting a quick, cramped stroke without much power or control.  The couple was also doing something I see far too often at the park:  frequently calling ""out"" and ending play instead of playing the ball anyway to try and keep the ""game"" going, keep up the rhythm, and getting in as much practice as possible instead of constantly stopping/restarting.</p>

<p>I was tempted to introduce myself, ask them if they wanted some unsolicited advice, and if so suggest the woman try to start her swing as soon as she sees what side of her body the ball will be arriving at (although she'd probably need practice changing her style but might end up with much better strokes), and also to simply try to continue playing when calling outs.</p>

<p>My wife said I should mind my own business, because I have no idea what sort of relationship, advice, practice, and coaching they've already gone through to reach a level of play they might be perfectly happy with.  On the other hand, my personal experience, for life in general not just sports, is that I've rarely received unsolicited advice at all let alone bad advice, and what unsolicited advice I have managed to receive is usually very helpful.  So from a ""golden rule"" perspective I would tend to want to give advice that I myself would want to receive.</p>

"How far is too far for Roger Federer?","<p>Well, not far enough in terms of innovating/rediscovering tennis in these dull times of monotonous baseline rallies. But the question is specifically about Roger Federer's recent attempts at hyper-aggressive half-volley returns on opponent's (second) serves.  </p>

<p>Federer, after Wimbledon, has on numerous occasions tried to charge towards the service line to take the returns early to unsettle the opponents.
While the attempt is nothing new, Serena Williams stands well inside the baseline against weak servers &amp; thumps return winners.   </p>

<p>But nobody has reached as 
far ahead as Federer has. He has taken the returns almost at the service line. So 3 questions.  </p>

<p>1) In any of his attempts, has the point of impact with the racquet been inside the service box?  </p>

<p>2) If NO, then, is having the point of impact inside the service box legal in tennis rules?  </p>

<p>3) If YES, then can he essentially, stand at the net &amp; volley the opponent's serves, from the rules point of view?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most distinguished doubleheader pitching achievement was that of
  “Big Ed” Reulbach of the Cubs, who did it only once, but nobody did it
  better.  His big day was September 26, 1908, when he threw a pair of
  shutouts in Brooklyn, allowing a total of just eight hits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had always assumed this was because pitchers in the old days didn't throw all the fancy pitches they do today. But <a href=""http://nyti.ms/1qZFkYc"" rel=""nofollow"">the New York Times indicates otherwise</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the past 12 years, a team led by Dr. Carl Nissen, a surgeon, has
  been doing research into the stresses inherent in pitching. At one
  point, Major League Baseball gave the center a grant to research why
  so many pitchers were being injured. Because the results contravened
  accepted wisdom — that certain pitches are more harmful than others,
  for example — Nissen believes that M.L.B. is unlikely to fund further
  studies there. “We were myth-busting,” Nissen said. “Beliefs handed
  down over time with no science behind them. It’s not the curveball
  that’s damaging to the elbow, as everyone says. It’s the fastball,
  thrown again and again over time. Pure physics.”</p>

"Why does the Vuelta a España have a combination classification?","<p>Stage races in cycling are interesting because they typically have multiple competitions inside one race. You have the general classification (usually seen as the most important one), and then there are numerous other classifications such as <em>points classification</em>, <em>intermediate sprints classification</em>, <em>mountains classification</em>, <em>young riders classification</em>, and the <em>combination classification</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>combination classification</em> is the one that confuses me, especially in the Vuelta a España, where it has consistently been one of the prizes for many years. This classification is almost always won by the same rider who wins the general classification. Because the combination classification is (literally) made up of a combination of the other classifications, there is no way for a rider to go for this prize; in order to improve your standings in the combination classification, a rider needs to improve his standings in <em>all other classifications</em>, which is something nobody is interested in doing. People who are possible contenders for this prize are usually also contenders for the general classification, which typically means that they <em>only care about the general classification</em>.</p>

<p>Interesting statistic: After 2003, only one rider has won the combination classification without also winning the general classification. This was Alejandro Valverde in 2012.</p>

<p>So, my question: why does the Vuelta keep employing the combination classification, and why don't they switch to a different prize that riders would actively try to achieve? Are there any historical reasons behind this, or sponsor contracts or so?</p>

"Could a player be in an offside position off the field of play?","<p>Before you immediately say 'yes', let me explain why I asked this question.</p>

<p>According to Law 11, a defending player who leaves the field of play for any reason shall be considered to be positioned on their goal line or touchline for the purposes of offside. When it comes to attacking players, it is only said that they can step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in active play, but if they re-enter from the goal line they may be penalised for offside (<a href=""http://theifab.com/#!/laws/offside/chapters/offside-infringements-and-sanctions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Law 11.4</a>).</p>

<p>But the Laws say nothing about <strong>an attacking player leaving the field of play as part of play.</strong> It is true that Law 12 now states that a free kick can be awarded if an offence is committed off the field of play provided the player left it as part of play, but it only refers to (physical) offences committed against another player (<a href=""http://theifab.com/#!/laws/fouls-and-misconduct/chapters/restart-of-play-after-fouls-and-misconduct"" rel=""noreferrer"">Law 12.4</a>), so offside is not counted.</p>

<p>The new wording of Law 11 makes things even worse. The old <a href=""http://www.fifa.com/mm/Document/FootballDevelopment/Refereeing/02/36/01/11/LawsofthegamewebEN_Neutral.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2015/16 Laws of the Game</a> read that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player is NOT in an offside position if:</p>
  
  <p>• he is <strong><em>in his own half of the field of play</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the new <a href=""http://theifab.com/#!/laws/offside/chapters/offside-position"" rel=""noreferrer"">2016/17 Laws of the Game</a> state that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player is in an offside position if:</p>
  
  <p>• any part of the head, body or feet is <strong><em>in the opponents’ half</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a huge difference between the two paragraphs: the old one allowed a player to be in an offside position off the field of play (because, indeed, he was not in his own half), whereas the new version implicitly denies that eventuality because any point that is not on the field of play is logically not part of the opponents' half.</p>

<p>Thus, here are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>what should a referee do if an attacking player, who leaves the field
of play as part of play and is in an offside position at the moment
the ball is played to him by a teammate, re-enters the field of play
to play the ball — or stays off the field of play to commit an
offside offence there (e.g. if the player interferes with an opponent by making an
obvious action that clearly impacts on the opponent's ability to play
the ball)?</li>
<li>if the player is penalised for offside, where does play restart from?</li>
</ul>

"Why weren't the Eagles penalized for illegal touching on this quick kick in 1986?","<p>In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO2ILLMWEKs&amp;t=4m30s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> you can see the Eagles punting the ball away on 2nd down and 40. Randall Cunningham punts the ball into the back of one of his offensive linemen and the ball pops up in the air but continues to travel downfield. The Redskins field the punt and return it for a few yards.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is why this isn't considered a 0-yard ""illegal touching"" penalty. Normally when a punt is touched by a member of the kicking team, the return team has the option of taking the ball at the spot where it was touched. This is the process by which a kicking team ""downs"" a punt. So why couldn't the Redskins have taken the ball at the spot where it hit the offensive lineman?</p>

"Is there a penalty for deliberating losing or fielding a weakened side?","<p>In the English Premier League, if any team deliberately tries to lose a game to give the opposition more points that could possibly damage the league position of a third team, say by fielding a weakened side or in extreme case score own goals, is there any penalty they could face for such action?</p>

<p>Also, I heard few years back that relegation some candidate threatened to report Chelsea to FA because they fielded a weakened side with young players against their relegation rivals at the end of the season game. </p>

<p>Is there any particular criteria set by FA to determine just what constitutes a weakened side in such a case, since the strength of a team is very subjective? Secondly has there ever been any action taken for such an incident in past?</p>

<p>In the final two matches Roma play Celtic and Barcelona play Shaktar. Barcelona had a poor run in previous five games due to injury to key players and silly red cards. Assuming that Barcelona can beat Shaktar in the final game, it makes sense for Roma to lose to Celtic deliberately to make them qualify instead of Barcelona, so that they wouldn't have to face a full strength Barcelona later in the group stages when all their key players have recovered.</p>

<li>Single chicane pylons to be crossed on alternating sides (with irrelevant roll angle).</li>

"How does arbitration work in baseball?","<p>First, my understanding is that they use professional labor arbitrators, not people with a strong specific knowledge of baseball.

<p>Second, my further understanding is that first, second and third year ""arb"" players tend to get about 40, 60 and 80 percent of what a free agent would get ""on average,"" although their is a wide variation in individual cases. That is, in some cases, the arbitrators would value players rather differently than the managers who sign free agents.</p>

<p>Third, my last understanding is that the arbitrator has to choose either the player's or team's salary proposal. He cannot ""split the difference"" or go outside the ranges.</p>

"How do (National League) managers decide when to ""pinch hit"" for their pitchers?","<p>You're in the top of the seventh inning with a 1-1 tied score. Your starter has thrown about 80 pitches, meaning that he's good for at least one, maybe two, more innings. Your bullpen is tired, but is still rated better than the other team's bullpen. Your seventh, eighth and ninth players are up. For now, we'll assume that whether or not we ""pinch hit"" for our starter depends on what the seventh and eighth players do. Here are my preferences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the seventh and eight batters both get on base, and one or both of them score (e.g. the second batter gets an extra base hit that scores the first batter, and possibly himself if it's a home run), I'll keep the pitcher in to protect my new (2-1 or 3-1) lead.</p></li>
<li><p>If the seventh and eighth batters both make an out, I'll let my pitcher close the top of the inning, so he can pitch at least the bottom of the seventh, on the theory that he'll ""save"" more runs than we'll score by having a pinch hitter bat for him. I might even tell him to strike out intentionally so he won't run the risk of getting injured.</p></li>
<li><p>If the seventh and eighth batters both get on base, say first and second, I'll ""pinch hit"" for my pitcher to try to score a go-ahead run.</p></li>
<li><p>If the seventh and eighth batters make one single (or walk) and one out, that's a close one, because I'm undecided between trying to score, or save, an extra run.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Two more considerations. 1) There's only one bench player left, meaning that if you use him now, all remaining pitchers will have bat for themselves. 2) Your starter bats only .053, but all your relievers bat .000. </p>

<p>The actual (Pirates') manager decided to pinch hit for the pitcher in scenario 2, after two outs.</p>

"Is a base runner automatically out if they stop advancing when forced to their next base?","<p>Here's a situation that came up during a back lot league softball game a few weeks ago.
(Note: While our league has some of its own rules we try to defer to MLB rules in all causes that aren't specifically addressed.)</p>

<p>There is a runner on second (R2) and a runner on first, with no outs. A ground ball is hit to the third baseman (3B) who cleanly fields the ball away from third base. Seeing that R2 is running toward him, 3B does not go to third and instead waits to tag the incoming R2. R2, in an attempt to buy some time for the other runners, stops advancing to third base. As soon as R2 stops, 3B declares R2 is out (without making a tag) and throws the ball to first to make a play.</p>

<p>During the discussion after the play, the 3B claimed that any player advancing on a force cannot stop moving toward their next bag or they are automatically out (the same way a runner leaving the baseline to avoid a tag is considered out). Our rules don't have a specific clause that addresses this situation and I couldn't find anything in official MLB rules (though it's possible I missed something, as 3B claims it is an MLB rule).</p>

<p>So, is 3B’s claim correct? That if a runner who is forced to advance to their next base stops (in particular to avoid/delay a tag) they are automatically out?</p>

"Is there a rule that protects the goalkeeper in the 6yard-box?","<p>After yesterday's red card for Nani in Manchester United against Real Madrid (March 5th 2013) I decided to read the entire Rulebook <code>Laws of the Game</code> by FIFA (IFAB), including the guidelines for referees concerning the interpretation of the rules. Sadly enough, this was my first time that I read the rules, although playing Football for nearly 20 years now.</p>

<p>I got the answer to my initial question whether the sending off was justified, but the rulebook raised a lot of different questions. The problem is that I found no clues to some common understandings of the game, for example that it is forbidden to clamp the ball between the legs in order to make it unreachable for the opponent.</p>

<p>The main issue, however, is that I could not find anything regarding the Goalkeeper receiving special treatment in the 6yard box (other than being dressed differently and being allowed to use the hands on the ball), as it is often pointed out and ruled as foul play.</p>

"Are you allowed to fake a field goal or punt?","<p>Whenever an offense reaches the 4th down in American Football, i.e. they didn't achieve to get a new 1st down in their past 3 attempts, they're faced with basically 2 fundamentally different options. They can either play that down as a ""normal"" offensive play in order to reach a new 1st down, or they can either punt the ball or attempt a field goal, depending how far they are from the end zone.</p>

<p>The usual strategy is to settle for a punt or field goal, unless the situation is rather urgent (i.e. you can't risk giving your opponent the offense) and/or you're confident you can make a new 1st down. What I haven't ever seen in the NFL (although, I'm only following it rather actively for about 2 seasons) is a <em>faked</em> field goal attempt or punt and I wonder if this is even possible. What I mean is making the play <em>look</em> like a field goal/punt, i.e. putting the special team and kicker on the field, and then having the kicker actually run (or pass?) the ball instead, trying to make a normal 4th down attempt.</p>

<p>So <strong>do the rules actually allow you to fake a field goal attempt or punt</strong> which you then transform into a normal play or does making a genuine field goal <em>attempt</em> require you to go through with this and not doing so would just result in a failed field goal? <strong>Is there a difference between punt and field goal in this regard? Or is there a difference between various rule sets, i.e. College and NFL?</strong> If you <em>are</em> technically allowed to do that to some degree in the NFL, then why isn't it done more often as a trick play?</p>

"What is a single powerplay in ice hockey?","<p>This is a question only about the statistical representation of power plays.</p>

<p>When looking at team statistics (<a href=""http://www.iihfworlds2016.com/en/statistics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>), there are numbers that describe teams efficiency in power plays and penalty killing.</p>

<p>In the linked example Denmark had an advantage 29 times and scored 10 goals thus having 34.48% powerplay efficiency. But how do they get the ""29""? It is clearly not the amount of penalties as in the penalty killing table Canada has had 29 disadvantages while actually having earned 35 penalties.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a 5-man team playing 2 minutes against team that has one player sent off on a minor penalty is a powerplay, but I am concerned about some trickier cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Player a (team X) is sent off for 2 minutes. After 1:50 (game time) player b (team X) is sent off. After 1:50 (game time) player c (team X) is sent off etc. Does this all counts as a single disadvantage situation? Can a team play 4v5 for 50 minutes and have only one penalty killed?</p></li>
<li><p>Player a (team X) is sent off for 5 minutes. A minute later player b (team Y) is sent off for 2 minutes. Does team X get two disadvantage situations based on a single penalty? It would seem wrong that you have more powerplays just because a 5 minute penalty was split in half by a minor penalty on the opposing team.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>As this question is pretty much a duplicate, I will specify that I am interested to find the interpretation that is used by IIHF as in the linked example. The <a href=""http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/IIHF_Official_Rule_Book_2014-18_Web_V6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IIHF rulebook</a> defines some of the statistics, but does not define this one.</p>

<p>I initially asked without specifying IIHF rules because I expected that there would be a common and accepted understanding of the statistic.</p>

"Why was spitball allowed to some players?","<p>Wikipedia has this to say on the history of banning spitball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spitball was banned in two stages. In the winter of 1919–1920, managers voted to partially ban the spitball, allowing each team to designate at most two pitchers who would be permitted to legally throw spitballs. Then, following the 1920 season, the spitball was banned leaguewide, except for existing spitballers who were grandfathered in and allowed to keep throwing the pitch legally until they retired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first stage looks highly surprising, but somewhat fair.  It's a way to allow some spitballs in the game but not all spitballs.</p>

<p>The second stage puzzles me.  Did this decision lead to inequality of rules between players and teams?  Was such inequality real, and seen as a problem?  Were there any considerations that made banning spitball for everybody impractical?</p>

"In fantasy baseball, should I avoid playing pitchers who are starting against my batters?","<p>One of the important things in fantasy football is to make sure that your defense isn't starting against your high-scoring offensive players, especially your quarterback.

"Is the runner on first forced to run?","<p>Looking for some clarification on this situation that came up today:</p>

<p>There is one out and a runner on first base (R1).  The batter hits a fly ball in the infield.  The first baseman (1st) makes an attempt to catch the ball and it drops out of his glove.  1st picks the ball up and tags the batter/runner out as he runs up the first base line (before he touches first base).  The batter/runner was called out, R1 stayed on first and we continued play with two outs now.  </p>

<p>Is this the correct call?  There was a lot of discussion as to whether R1 is still forced to second base on this play (allowing someone to tag him for a double play) or can R1 stay put on first base (as was allowed in our case)?</p>

<p>I know rule 7.03 b states : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a runner is forced to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner and two runners are touching a base to which the following runner is forced, the following runner is entitled to the base and the preceding runner shall be out when tagged or when a fielder possesses the ball and touches the base to which such preceding runner is forced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our situation is slightly different as the batter/runner never made it to first base before being tagged out. </p>

"How are football players objectively rated?","<p>Football (soccer) by comparison to many other sports has very little in the way of personal player statistics. This is particularly true for defenders, who don't even have the number of goals scored as a potential comparison statistic. How then are players compared? How do fans, commentators and managers agree on the players that are playing well and those that are not? For many other sports, even if you didn't watch a game, reviewing the stats will give you a fair indication of the players that did well or poorly in that game. This doesn't seem possible for Football, which means you need to watch every single game in order to judge who is doing well.</p>

"Defense against an isolation play","<p>I'm a geezer now, but when I played competitive ultimate, a specific type of isolation play was very popular.  Near the end zone, the handler would call out ""Iso bob"" (or whatever they wanted to signify the play), and everyone except bob would clear the end zone.  Bob's defender would then have the choice of either facing bob or facing the handler.  If he faced bob, the handler would throw, and bob would have a step on him for a crisp throw.  If he faced the handler, bob would cut and have a step on him for the cut.  If another player ran in to help, his mark would cut to a corner of the end zone.</p>

"What makes financial fair play fair?","<p>My understanding of the financial fair play rule from UEFA is that clubs can't spend more money then they take in from ticket sales, sponsorships, media deals, etc. The goal being to prevent a super rich owner from coming in and dumping loads of money into a team to buy all the good players and keep everyone else from getting a chance at them.</p>

<p>As I watch this happen though, I'm wondering how this is actually fair to the smaller clubs. The big clubs will continue to make millions and millions from sponsorship deals that the smaller clubs won't have a chance to get unless they somehow can break into that elite group.</p>

<p>If you use the EPL as an example, the best teams in the league have pretty much always been the same (or at least for the last 25 or so years since the silly amounts of money have been poured into the game). There isn't really a chance for even a medium level team like West Brom or Hull to break into the top 4 long term because they won't be able to keep their best players, even if they have a rich owner swoop in a give them millions.</p>

"Why are WR in the slot covered by non-CBs in American football?","<p>It's College Bowl season and I'm seeing/hearing some things from the announcers that I need some clarification on.  Please note, I have never played any organized football before so all I know is from watching with my dad and friends.</p>

<p>There was a WR who multiple times lined up either in the backfield, in the slot, or what looks like as a wing back (and motioned out to the slot area).  The defense for some reason played him with a LB or Safety and have gotten torched multiple times because of the speed mismatch (huge gains of 20+ yds, TD catch, etc).  Why can't the defense leave a CB to shadow the guy, even if he's in the backfield, slot, wingback position?  </p>

<p>For each of the plays where he torched them, I don't know the offensive personnel package but in general the personnel package shouldn't be the problem.  If for example I see 3 WR and 2 RB, I'll have my nickel package to defend so the personnel match up shouldn't be the issue.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The game I am referring to is the <a href=""http://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400876041"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Southern Miss vs. Univ Louisiana Lafayette game in the 2016 New Orleans Bowl</a>.

He's their #1 WR in all the passing categories (recs, yds, TDs, YAC) and doesn't seem like a possession receiver or 3rd string WR.  The highlights they played in the game during breaks showed he was beating man to man coverage.</p>

<p>I have seen and heard before on tv from many other announcers after a big play that it was a mismatch b/c so-and-so WR on (insert NFL or college team) was being defended by a LB or Safety and torched the defense.  I don't know what the offensive personnel was at the time for any of these plays were either but my guess is they had at least 3 WRs if some non-CB had to guard a WR but if as a defensive coordinator you see 3 WR running out, why wouldn't you trot out your nickel defense? </p>

<p>Conversely, if you're down 5-1, with the opponent on serve, might it make sense to concede the game on the <strong>opponent's</strong> serve to get to the next set with you on serve?</p>

"Why are ""walkovers"" allowed in tennis tournaments?","<p>Stan Wawrinka got a ""walkover"" in the third round of the U.S. open when his opponent had to withdraw from the match.</p>

"What are the dynamics of trading one veteran for several prospects?","<p>This question can be answered for any sport, but the one I understand best is baseball.</p>

<p>The Phillies' GM Reuben Amaro made a statement that prospects were overvalued in the marketplace, which is to say his opinion was that too few of them were offered for veteran players.</p>

<p>For instance, Amaro declined to trade veteran pitcher Cole Hamels to the Los Angeles Dodgers for anything less than their three top prospects, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager, and Julio Urias, NO deal. Maybe a deal could have been done for ONE of those three, plus two lesser prospects</p>

<p>My understanding is that prospects are something of ""lottery tickets,"" and you need  at least two, preferably three of them of the same category to replace the veteran you are giving up.</p>

<p>There is one hidden factor, and that is, by trading a veteran for prospects, you do a salary dump that enables you to hire another veteran, or retain another one (e.g. the Phillies dump Hamels so that they can afford to pay Cliff Lee).</p>

<p>Meaning that the Phillies offer of Hamels for the three prospects might have been ""fair"" if they had been willing to retain Hamels' salary as well.</p>

<p>So do teams actually manage to directly replace the value of their veterans by trading for prospects? Or is it the salary dump that makes up the difference?</p>

"runner in scoring position batting average","<p>Is ""runner in scoring position"" batting average a meaningful statistic?</p>

<p>I am simply a casual fan, but here is my logic.  Either one of these universes is reality:</p>

<p>1) when there are runners in scoring position, a batter changes his approach to ensure that he will get a base hit.  Perhaps he just tries to make contact, forgets about swinging for the fences, etc.  Therefore, ""runner in scoring position"" batting average is actually an important measure of a batter's ability to drive in runs.  It <strong>is</strong> a better predictor of a batter getting a base hit in a situation where there are runners in scoring position than batting average.  (If that is the case, why not always use this approach to increase the chance of getting on base??)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>2) a batter is ALWAYS trying to maximize their chance to get on base. ""Runner in scoring position"" batting average is simply a smaller sample of at bats measure of a batter's batting average.  It is <strong>not</strong> a better predictor of a batter getting a base hit in a situation where there are runners in scoring position than batting average.</p>

"Why is on-screen technology not used in football?","<p>Time and time again I see situations in football matches that would have greatly benefited one of the teams had the correct decision been made - and had the referee used the screen which would have been of no hindrance, the correct decision would have been made.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In the Chelsea vs Man City game on Sunday, I think it was Aguero made a straight-red-worthy tackle on either Mata or Suarez (I can't remember which). The referee gave a free kick but no card as he hadn't seen the second, far more rash, part of the challenge. The rash part was clearly shown on the huge screen, which the referee saw. However, he wasn't allowed to issue the red card after seeing it - an absolutely ridiculous thing.</p>

<p>In the World Cup 2010, Argentina scored a knock-out goal against Mexico, which was actually offside. The referee couldn't make the final decision based on the on-screen replay.</p>

<p>Lampard scored a goal which bounced back out, but the referee didn't allow it, even after seeing the replay, because he wasn't allowed. </p>

<p>In Rugby this technology is made great use of, and it makes for a far better and fairer game, with tries only being awarded if they were actually tries.</p>

<p>Why can't referees look at the video and make the decision? It would really make hardly any difference to the length of the game - perhaps it would add on an extra several minutes (3 minutes is really no problem). It just seems absolutely ridiculous, and no one I've spoken to is in favour of the rule.</p>

"Meaning of the phrase: To drive the ball ""on the up""?","<p>I have heard many times cricket commentators referring to players driving the ball 'on the up'. By the context, this is taken to be a difficult and risky thing to do and makes a good shot even better as the batsmen is displaying some boldness by playing the shot to that delivery. As in ""that was a fine cover drive, and he was playing the ball on the up"".</p>

<p>Why is this confusing to me? Anytime that you play a drive, the ball is 'coming up'. The only exception would be a full toss, but that is an unusual delivery so it would be hardly remarkable to play any shot to a non full toss.</p>

<p>There are many examples of nonsensical phrases in sports commentary and the viewer just needs to learn what a particular nonsensical phrase means. In this case I've never understood what is being meant by this. My best guess is that the ball is fuller or shorter than a delivery that you would normally expect to see a drive played against (one or the other, it couldn't mean both). Any ideas?</p>

"Is this a legal way to tag-up and run faster?","<p><strong>Scenario:</strong>
With 1 out and a runner on third-base, the batter hits a sacrificial fly ball to right field, enabling the runner to head for home.</p>

<p>It appears the runner would be faster if he took a few steps down the third base line, <strong><em>away</em></strong> from Home, and begins his run at a full sprint, moments before the fly-ball is caught.  He'd tag up on third just after the catch, and already be moving at full speed towards home.  That is far faster than starting at third from a dead stop.</p>

<p>Here are some criteria I considered, and their exceptions:</p>

<h2>Popularity</h2>

<p>West Ham's captain is <strong>Mark Noble</strong> who is a stranger to neutral fans compared to Dimitri Payet.<br>
Liverpool's <strong>Jordan Henderson</strong> is injury-prone, and with an FPL score of 7, might as well be another benchwarmer.</p>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>Manchester City selected <strong>Vincent Kompany</strong>, a central defender who rarely moves up the pitch, as their captain.<br>
Arsenal has <strong>Per Mertesacker</strong>, also a central defender, as their captain. Being the slowest on the team makes him an unlikely playmaker. The previous captain, Mikel Arteta, played as a defensive midfielder, which is slightly more reasonable for the position criteria.</p>

<h2>Communication / Chemistry</h2>

<p>Manchester City's <strong>Yaya Touré</strong> is one of few professional soccer players from Côte d'Ivoire. Based on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ob44ctgcnE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KSI's gameplay video with him</a>, it can be said that his English is not perfect.<br>

"What happens if the result of match was found wrong after the match day?","<p>Consider a situation where <strong>Team A</strong> and <strong>Team B</strong> are playing a cricket match,</p>

<p>Team A scored some odd runs (lets assume 250 runs).</p>

<p>Team B is chasing the score, while chasing they require 2 runs from a ball. Bowler bowls the ball Umpire somehow declare it as a NO ball and batsman is able to take only single run from that ball in this case the Team B wins the match because of that NO ball.</p>

<p>Now my question is after a day of the match Team A checks the replays and finds it was not a NO ball or it was not appropriate to say that ball was not legal to be bowled and if that is considered the result should have been tie instead of Team B winning the match, will the result can be changed on the appeal from Team A?</p>

For these cue sports one usually play with a 9mm tip. Even though American pool balls are slightly bigger and heavier than the balls used on British tables, I still think that I might struggle to get used to a 13mm tip (this seems by far the most common option when buying an American pool cue; other sizes like 12 or 11.75 mm are quite rare, so I presume they are not as common as the 13mm tips among players?). An American cue might feel very different from what I'm used to, almost like I'd be playing with a broomstick rather than a cue. Furthermore, I'm afraid that the amount of spin (or ""English"" if you prefer) that I can put on a ball with a 13mm tip is far less than what I could do with a snooker cue, thus increasing my sense of frustration.</p>

It's the last ball of the game and batting team needs 2 runs to win.

"How can I get my overhand throw to properly turn over?","<p>I've been playing disc golf for several years and have experimented with an overhand (or tomahawk) shot for several years. However, the shot has always been inconsistent for me. It always gets the required height, but rarely achieves the distance I want on it. I know that there is a way to get it to turn over (so that the disc is flying upside down) and I occasionally achieve this, but I cannot do it consistently.</p>

<p>What is the technique for achieving this shot? Are certain discs better at achieving the turnover than others? </p>

My friend has had a Dunlop racquet for the last few years as well. He has had to replace his grommet strip on several occasions. I believe these damaged grommets to be the reason for his strings breaking. I had a Black Knight racquet for over four years before I broke it on an ill place backhand shot, and in all those years I never had a single grommet break even once. now that I have a Dunlop racquet I am worried that the grommet strip wont stand up as well. if I ever need to replace the string is there only one grommet strip made for a design of racquet or are there tougher grommet strips that I can buy?

In comparison to South American and French, Dutch, German etc players that are all over the football scene, how come British players don't get headhunted nearly as often as players of other nationalities? Is it used to be like this in the past (70s-80s)?<em>emphasized text</em></p>

<p>I did some mental exercise to try and recall British stars going to major clubs; and I can only recall Beckham (from Man Utd to Real Madrid), McManaman (from Liverpool to Real Madrid) and Woodgate (from Newcastle Utd to... well you know it, Real Madrid). <em>Am I missing some notable examples?</em> </p>

<p>I would also argue that none of these players really excelled in Spain. Looking at the stats on Wikipedia:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McManaman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve McManaman</a>: 14 goals, 33 assists in 157 games (4 seasons in the club)</li>

</ul>

<p>The only answer I can imagine that makes sense is that Premier League has a very different culture to it and that British players either aren't versatile enough to do the job in another league, or that they do not want to adapt. But even that's a weak answer. So what reasons could be responsible for this situation?</p>

"Should your feet be in the air when serving?","<p>I have seen it being taught two different ways:</p>

<p>1) Lifting only left heel, but left foot stays on the ground.</p>

<p>2) Bending knees, and doing leg spring action, lifting your legs off the ground, propelling yourself up and into the ball.</p>

<p>I have seen pros and they seem to have feet in the air. Which way is correct? Have you seen anyone using #1?</p>

<p>Wondering if #1 is better suited for older players who don't want more strain on their lower legs/ankles.</p>

"Is there a penalty for kicking a PAT from the 2 yard line in the NFL?","<p>This year the NFL changed the way extra points work so that 2-point-conversion attempts are snapped from the 2 yard line as they always were, but extra points are now snapped from the 15.

"Is there a rule for when K-Balls are used?","<p>In the NFL, special balls (""K-Balls"") are used for kicking plays. These balls are harder and slicker than the balls used during normal play.

Is there a rule that governs when a k-ball is used and is there any way for a team to exploit those rules?</p>

<p>For example, could a team line up as if they were going to go for it on fourth down with the punter lined up in a wide-receiver position and then shift before the snap to normal punt formation without having the ball changed?</p>

"American football delay of game","<p>Scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your team is up by 5.</li>
<li>There are 5 minutes remaining in the game.</li>
<li>It is 4th down and goal-to-go from the opponent’s 40 yard line (you’ve
had a lot of penalties).</li>
<li>Your punter can guarantee hang-time of 10 seconds, but his minimum distance is 41 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.</li>
<li>Your placekicker has been in the league for 20 years and
has never successfully kicked a field goal longer than 50 yards,
after having tried 100 times.</li>

"I want to improve as an older skater- I've started with Penny boards - what is the next stage?","<p>I've been learning how to skate around the back streets and on my brief commute to work over the past few months. I'm a 45yo 165cm 77kg man.</p>

<p>I've been using a penny nickel and a penny 22 that I got when my 10yo son was briefly interested in skating up and Dow the street with his friends. </p>

<p>For someone who has never skated, surfed or snowboarder I'm pretty happy that I can stop, carve(sort-of) and generally get around my local streets at a reasonable pace. I'm faster than my son on his micro scooter and I can carve from the top to the bottom of our street - it is a shallow incline but you can go pretty fast. I can't Ollie or slide. (Yet!)</p>

<p>On the suggestion of the guy at the lavas skate shop I got some hard (99) wheels to try sliding, but I don't think I adequately described the road surface. I quickly switched back to the penny wheels(84 I think).</p>

<p>I'm really enjoying skating as a way to get round and I want to get better. </p>

<p>I'm liking the penny boards, but I have some misgivings: the 22 is light but probably too small - I find it easier to skate in blundstone boots because the sole is so large an rigid it effectively gives me a larger board. The Nickel is a nice size - but it is heavy to carry on public transport. I also feel safer on the nickel in wet conditions. (Around Ealing UK FWIW)</p>

<p>Should I get a new board? If so what?</p>

<p>I'm not really constrained by price, but I can't be arsed building a board unless there is a <em>really</em> compelling reason.</p>

"American Football: Why take knee before halftime?","<p>I'm interested in the following situation: a team in American football possesses the ball with less than a minute left in the first half of a game and is facing a long field to score.  Oftentimes, teams will have their quarterback take a knee here to effectively end the half.  This seems to be pretty common and it's commonly accepted as sound strategy, but I'm struggling to see how it is the most beneficial choice for the team.  You can sometimes see teams do this at the end of a tie game--""playing it safe"" and taking their chances in overtime.</p>

<p>From my point of view, the only outcomes that matter from running an extra play or two are either A) Your team scores, or B) The other team scores --any other result is meaningless.  Do you teams really think that running a play (even a ""safe"" one like a run up the middle) will result in an opponent scoring more often than their own scoring probability?  If so, what makes this different than any other play; i.e., why run any offensive play at all at any point?  </p>

<p>Another consideration that I've surmised is that a team may be worried about having a possible injury.  That seems like a pretty small risk to me and you're just as likely to have an injury happen to the opposing team.  I know that these plays aren't usually a big deal, but what am I missing that makes this strategy so well-accepted?</p>

"In a video challenge in volleyball, does the challenging team have to specify the challenged fault?","<p>Assume the following situation: In a high-class (high enough for a video challenge system being in place) volleyball game an attack hit goes out of bounds and the referee assigns the point to the defending team. However, the attacking team thinks they have seen the block touching the ball and call a video challenge. When reviewing the video replay, the referee does not find a ball touch by the block, but it shows a touch of the net by one of the blocking players, so it would indeed be a point for the attacking team.</p>

<p>My question is now, what are the rules of such a challenge? Must the challenging team specify which type of fault they want to have reviewed (such as ""block touched the ball"") or is it enough to just challenge based on ""during this action, we think that the situation was different from what the referee decided"" and then just the whole situation is reviewed in the video material? And if the former is the case, is the referee obliged to give the challenge to the challenging team if they cannot confirm the reason for the challenge but finds a different fault that would change the original decision – such as the net violation in my example situation above?</p>

<p><strong>Additional clarification:</strong>
Since the video challenge is obviously not part of the official FIVB rules, let's restrict this question to international tournaments directly organized by the FIVB, i.e. World Cups and World League/World Grand Prix competitions.</p>

Furthermore, the <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-all-star-game-scraps-format--is-now-3-on-3-divisional-tournament-025040619.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NHL All-Star game was reformatted into a series of 3-on-3 ""mini games.""</a></p>

<p><strong>How does a team's strategy differ playing 3-on-3 rather than 5-on-5?</strong> There is an increase in scoring, but the goalie has to adjust to more shots being taken, there isn't much of an opportunity to create traffic in front of the net, and with less players, their endurance becomes more of a factor.</p>

"Difference between one gap and two gap techniques for defensive linemen","<p>While watching American football, I frequently hear about ""one gap"" or ""two gap"" techniques when referring to defensive linemen. I found this terminology to be a bit unclear, so I looked for an explanation online. I found a few articles like <a href=""http://www.xsosfootball.com/one-gap-and-two-gap-techniques/"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>What is the primary difference between these techniques? It seems that the way the defensive linemen are lined up and their defensive responsibilities are the main factors. My understanding is that one gap defender is lined up between two offensive linemen and only worries about the gap between his opponents, while a two gap defender is lined up directly across from an offensive lineman and has to defend the space on either side of the blocker. From the diagram, it seems that 3-4 defensive linemen would tend to be two gap defenders, while 4-3 defensive linemen tend to be one gap defenders. Is my understanding correct?</p>

"Enforcement of traveling in basketball","<p>In most levels of basketball, from youth leagues to the college level, <a href=""http://www.ditchwalk.com/tag/traveling/"">traveling</a> seems to be enforced fairly regularly. However, at the NBA level, traveling seems to be <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4563546"">rarely enforced</a>, with the rules now updated to state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon
  completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop,
  passing or shooting the ball.</p>

"What is this three-against-one game with red and blue balls?","<p>On a recent visit to the <a href=""http://www.colorado.edu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Colorado, Boulder</a>, I saw some students playing a sport I've never seen before.  I'll do my best to describe it.</p>

<p>On a grass field, a rectangle is marked out with string, about 5m by 10m.  Inside the rectangle are six balls, about 20 cm in diameter, three red and three blue, placed at specific locations.  There are four players, who start out standing outside the rectangle: three at one of the short edges (marked X below) and one at a long edge (marked O).  Here is a very crude drawing.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bb5BJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In addition to the four players, there is a fifth person who seems to be a judge.</p>

<p>The play of the game appears to go as follows.  The judge calls ""Go"", and the X players try to run into the rectangle, pick up a ball, and return to their original position.  When one of them picks up a ball, the O player runs into the rectangle and tries to tag him.</p>

<p>There seems to be some rules or strategy governing how they do this.  The X players can wait for a favorable moment to make their attempt.  Sometimes they chose a red ball and sometimes a blue ball; I couldn't tell what was the significance of this choice.  Also, sometimes an X player would get a ball and the O player would apparently decide not to try to chase him.  It also wasn't clear whether the X players were cooperating or competing with each other.</p>

<p>I saw at least two simultaneous games going on, so I don't think it was just random fooling around.  The players seemed to know what they were doing.</p>

<p><strong>What is this game called?</strong>  Does it have formal rules, and if so, where can I find them?</p>

"Are there any rules in baseball which prohibit teams from ""borrowing"" players via trade?","<p>Every season near the trade deadline, we see teams that are out of it trading expensive players and/or free agents-to-be, typically for younger players or prospects.  For example, Matt Garza, set to become a free agent after the season, was traded to the Rangers for a few prospects.</p>

<p>It made sense for the Cubs to trade Garza, because he wasn't under contract any further than this season, and thus doesn't have much value to them.</p>

<p>Compare Garza to someone like Mike Trout, who is likely the most valuable property in baseball, given his skill and inexpensive cost over the next several years.  There's no way the Angels would trade him, because he'll be the cost-controlled centerpiece of the team for years to come.</p>

<p>However, with the Angels out of it this year, what if they wanted to trade Trout to a contender (say the Pirates), <em>but only for the remainder of this season</em>?  That is, they'd get several top prospects now, and would have an agreement with the Pirates that they'd trade him back in the offseason (for something pretty worthless, say for a journeyman minor leaguer).</p>

<p>The Pirates get Trout for the stretch run and are happy to give up a few prospects.  Trout doesn't have much value to the Angels this year, but he has a ton of value for next year.  So they get a few prospects for him, in exchange for the part of his career which has very little value to them.</p>

<p>So in effect, the Pirates are renting or borrowing him for the remainder of 2013.</p>

<p>Why don't trades like this happen?  Are there any rules prohibiting trades like this?  </p>

<p>The only way I can make sense of it, is if a bigger club wants to have the option of buying a promising player in the future, so they buy 50% of the contract in advance (presumably for a lower sum) to possibly buy the other half later on and make some money as such. But then again why would a smaller club want to accept a much lower fee and a complicated contract for a promising player? </p>

"NFL rule changes to balance defense more, but do not reduce player safety","<p>This might get flagged as an opinion question, but I hope not. I think its interesting. Offensive numbers started to rise in the early 1980s. According to wikipedia, the 1978 season had a series of rule changes to increase scoring. I think there have been alot of rule changes over the last 30+ years to improve offense. I do not think most of them were done to help player safety. Are their rules changes that the NFL could make to balance the game more that would not make the game less safe? I don't think the NFL wants to because offense generally brings more ratings. I was thinking of a few. I hope this question is ok. </p>

<ol>
<li>offensive pass interference includes loss of down. The penalties for defensive pass interference are so much worse. </li>
<li>Defenders can now touch players up to 10 yards down field instead of 5 (this dates to the 1978 rule changes) possibly unless that defender is inside the opponents 20 yard line. (not alot of space when you are near the goal line). This might be really complex to enforce... </li>

<p>For a pass play, a receiver must have control of the ball with either two feet down, or equivalent (e.g. one knee down).  <strong>But, to be considered a touchdown, does the ball not still need to break the plane of the goal line, even if the receiver gets two feet down in the end zone, with control?</strong></p>

<p>In today's San Francisco / Philadelphia game, Stevie Johnson was awarded a touchdown on a great catch, where he came <em>back</em> to the ball, and got two feet down in the very front corner of the end zone, while falling out of bounds.</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092809/2014/REG4/eagles@49ers#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000402398&amp;tab=videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092809/2014/REG4/eagles@49ers#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000402398&amp;tab=videos</a> ... Wk 4 Can't Miss Play: Stevie Wonder)</p>

<p>Given the angle that his body fell (back toward the line of scrimmage and toward the sideline), where the ball in his hands landed as he hit the ground (the 1 yard line), and the proximity of his feet to the front corner of the end zone, it seems to me like this should not have been called a touchdown, with the ball instead being placed on the half yard line (ish).</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding a nuance of the rule for catches in the end zone?  Does it matter that the player established his body in the end zone before coming back to the ball?  Is this just an instance of announcers and officials not noticing something that usually isn't an issue?  I heard no mention of the question of whether the plane was ever broken on the broadcast, or sports media write-ups of the game.  The focus only seemed to be whether a catch was made (which it clearly was).</p>

"Offside when the ball was last played by the defending team","<p>In football; after an attack on goal, the goalkeeper gains possession.  An attacking player quietly remains behind the goalkeeper in hopes to be forgotten.  The goalkeeper drops the ball to feet in order to play (not having noticed the attacker loitering behind).  The attacker springs to action and steals the ball and knocks home a goal.  The player is not considered offside.  What rule allows this play to continue?  It seems counter to the offside rule or could be labeled as trickery?  </p>

<p>Further, in a recent match, a player 10 yards offside received a glancing ball off a defender's attempted clearance header and hit one home.  What is the correct ruling?
Thanks.</p>

Arsenal VS Spartak Moscow (1925)</p>

<p>Fog was covering the pitch (White Hart Lane), and it was too hard to see, impossible to play a match.</p>

<p>But the ref refused to cancel the match, because the other team came all the way from Russia.</p>

<p>Anyway the match was a total mess, an Arsenal player was sent off because he kept arguing with the ref. He came back in to the match later and the ref didn't notice him. Spartak made a change, but the subbed player didn't go off the pitch, the match continued this way and the ref wasn't able to see anything.</p>

<p>At a moment in that match, Spartak played with 15 players. Arsenal players started to feel something was wrong, but nobody was able to count the players.</p>

<p>And the real problem was when the Arsenal keeper got injured because his head smashed into the post while trying to save a ball. The keeper went out of the game, and a fan jumped there instead of him, and nobody noticed.</p>

"Is this a subtlety in the icing rule?","<p>I feel like I have a good grasp of hybrid <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">icing</a> in the NHL, but every couple of games I notice what looks to be a missed icing call.</p>

<ul>
<li>The defensive team gains possession of the puck in their own zone.</li>
<li>Both teams immediately begin changing some players (benches are on each team's defensive side of the rink), as one defensive player slowly carries the puck into the neutral zone.</li>
<li>Two opposing defensemen -- slowly retreating, anticipating a trip to the bench -- have left a small lane for the player to carry the puck just past the center line, but the defensive player does not take it.</li>
<li>While between his team's blue line and the center line, the defensive player clears the puck past the opposing defensemen to the opposing goal line, but <em>not</em> directly at the goal. <strong>The puck leaves his stick at least 3 feet before the center line</strong>. </li>
<li>The opposing team will clearly be the next to touch the puck.</li>
<li>All skaters are now changing or have just come onto the ice. Fresh opposing defensemen skate back to their goal to retrieve the puck.</li>
<li>The opposing goalie may or may not come out to play the puck, but it was apparent before this fact that icing would not be called.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the puck crosses the center line and goal line, and no players touch the puck before it crosses the goal line, I always expect an icing call. The body language of the players on the ice indicates that they know it won't be called for icing, so the goalie's choice to come out and play it does not seem to be a factor.</p>

<p><strong>Is icing called off when both teams are substituting, even if the cleared puck meets all criteria of an icing?</strong></p>

<p>Otherwise, are the officials missing an occasional icing call, or do they allow the puck to be released less than some distance (like 5 feet) behind the center line when possession is clearly being exchanged for a full change? The defensive player is trending toward his bench as he clears it, so he knows it won't be called. I'm wondering if this has something to do with bench location, as I only see this play when the bench is on the defense's side.</p>

<p>My opponent claimed a foul, since ""only the cue ball touched a rail, and not the object ball"".</p>

<p>Coming from a snooker background, I find the rules of 8-ball safety play somewhat confusing. I read the official 8-ball rule guide, however I did not see an explicit rule that corresponds to my situation.</p>

<p>So what constitutes a legal ""safety shot"" in 8-ball pool? Can I only snooker my opponent when both cue ball and object ball touch the rail? Is there an order in which this must happen (i.e., does the cue ball have to touche the rail first, or last)?</p>

"Can you ever touch the ball with two hands between bounces while dribbling?","<p>Look at <a href=""https://youtu.be/y_AjX1pZj_E?t=6m42s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> at 6:42. NBA rules today state that this is not legal. Is this legal under NFHS/NCAA rules?</p>

<p>He tosses the ball behind his back with his right hand and then continues his dribble with his left hand. At no point does he ever touch the ball with both hands simultaneously. Let's assume he doesn't carry (go under) the ball with his right hand on that behind-the-back toss.</p>

<p>Excerpt from the 2017-2018 NCAA rulebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Art. 4. The dribble ends when:  </p>
  
  <p>a. The dribbler catches or carries/palms the ball by allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands;</p>
  
  <p>b. The dribbler touches the ball with both hands simultaneously;</p>
  
  <p>c. An opponent bats the ball; or</p>
  
  <p>d. The ball becomes dead</p>

<p>It doesn't look like the rules prohibit this type of move when done well, yet people often say that it's illegal. Are there other rules or interpretations that I'm missing? Please provide any official sources you use in your answer.</p>

"In badminton, which part of the shuttle determines ‘in’ or ‘out’?","<p>The basic rule of whether a shuttle is considered ‘in’ or ‘out’ in badminton is whether it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lands outside the boundaries of the court </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. not on or within the boundary lines (<a href=""http://www.worldbadminton.com/rules/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laws of Badminton</a>, §13.3.1). That rule doesn’t seem to have been clarified in any more detail anywhere that I can find, though.</p>

<p>A few times now, I have seen cases in professional matches where the instant replay in slow-motion seem to show the shuttle landing very horizontally, with the cork base of the shuttle landing just <strong>outside</strong> the line, but the feathers landing simultaneously (or at least so simultaneously that it was impossible to tell, even in slow-motion, which part landed first) <strong>on</strong> the line.</p>

<p>I seem to recall some of these having been called in and some out, but I don’t recall any Hawk-Eye-enabled challenged being taken to decide.</p>

<p>Hawk-Eye systems show the shuttle as a single circular shape at the point of impact, which might imply that the base of the shuttle is the part that actually counts; but then again, it’s just a simplified CGI animation and not necessarily intended to encode any such deeper meaning.</p>

<p>So in a case like this, where the base lands outside the land but the feathers simultaneously land on the line, should the shuttle be considered in or out? Has this been clarified in any official capacity?</p>

"Can a Hall of Fame player come out of retirement and play again","<p>In (at least) North America it's a tradition to induct the very best players of a league who have not been playing for a certain amount of years. All major leagues in North America: NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL practice this tradition.</p>

<p>Almost all of the athletes who make it to the Hall of Fame have long careers. Furthermore, most these athletes retire either because of injuries and health reasons, or because they pass their prime and are no longer as effective as they used to be. In both these cases, it is improbable for these players to come out of retirement after the minimum inactive period required by their respective league to become eligible for Hall of Fame. This makes it even harder for a Hall of Famer to make a comeback, and frankly I can't think of any player who has done this in recent years. The only players who I think could possibly do this (but don't believe they'll do) are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pronger"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chris Pronger</a>, and maybe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brett Favre</a>.</p>

<p>Can a player who's been inducted to the Hall of Fame come out of retirement and start playing in that league again? I personally don't see why the leagues would have problem with this, but if it happens what is the policy of the leagues cited above regarding this situation. Will the athlete's Hall of Fame status be suspended for the time he continues to play?</p>

"In basketball, what would be the result of a foul on the shooter and then a foul on the player attempting to block the shot?","<p>Inspired a bit by <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/15716/what-happens-when-a-player-is-fouled-hard-while-they-are-going-for-an-and-one"">this question</a>...  </p>

<p>The scenario:  </p>

<ul>
<li>A player is fouled by a defender while in the act of shooting, and puts up a shot.  </li>
<li>Another defender sees the shot being taken, and has a path to block the shot on its upward trajectory.  </li>
<li>As he goes to block it, another offensive player steps late into the path of the defender, illegally impeding him.</li>
</ul>

<p>What would the result be?  </p>

<p>I'm assuming a player is legally allowed to block a shot after a whistle (when continuation is given... or also after the horn to end a quarter) since the shot is still live.</p>

<p>I'm also under the belief that typically an offensive player illegally impeding a defender's block would be a loose ball foul if the shot has already been released (an offensive foul before the ball is shot)?</p>

<p>Would the result be akin to a typical double foul?</p>

"Shot on target with deflection - a goal or an own goal","<p>It's generally accepted that if a shot was on target but then deflected from another team's player and went in, then the goal is not considered as an own goal. <em>""Generally accepted""</em>, because there are no official rules regulating these scenarios.</p>

<p>But what about Sergio Ramos's 2nd goal in Napoli vs Real Madrid, Round of 16, 2nd leg, 2016/17 Champions League game (<a href=""https://youtu.be/jwWOztR97D8?t=2m19s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Europe video</a>) (<a href=""http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/video/892243011847"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US video</a>)?

<p>The only guess I have is that as this shot was directed towards the goalkeeper Pepe Reina, the guys who define the authorship of the goals decided that if there hasn't been a deflection, Reina would have easily caught the ball. So, why this goal is counted as an own goal?</p>

"Rushing yards vs passing yards vs receiving yards?","<p>I'm trying to understand football and some of its basic stats, and I'm not clear on the difference between these three.</p>

<p>Rushing yards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A statistic in football that records the total number of yards gained by a single player as the result of a rushing play (or plays), in which the player carries the football (as opposed to receiving a pass).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Passing yards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A statistic that measures the amount of yards gained by an offensive team on completed passes. Passing yards are measured for a given completion as the number of yards from the original line of scrimmage and the point that the player was tackled, forced out of bounds, or entered the end zone for a touchdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Receiving yards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a statistic used in football defined as the number of yards gained by a receiver on a passing play. Included in the calculation of this statistic is the distance the ball was passed and any additional yardage the player gained after the reception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a rushing play? How does a player get a ball <em>other</em> than by having it passed to them, excluding interceptions? If the ball always starts in a QB's hands, how can it possibly end up in anyone else's other than by a pass?</p>

<p>Honestly all three of these sound like ""yards gained in a play by passing the ball to someone and having them run with it.""</p>

<p>My understanding is that despite the phrasing in these definitions, these stats can apply to single players or to teams as a whole, but even so I don't see the distinction between them. They all seem to measure yards gained by a player who received the ball and ran with it.</p>

"At what point does a player earn his prize money and points for getting to a certain stage in a tournament?","<p>If a player pulls out of a match (eg. due to injury), do they still get the prize money and points for it? </p>

<p>So say, player A has qualified for the australian open which has a prize money of 50k and 10points for a first round loser (<a href=""http://www.tennisguru.net/2017/01/australian-open-2017-prize-money-breakdown-ranking-points/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.tennisguru.net/2017/01/australian-open-2017-prize-money-breakdown-ranking-points/</a>).</p>

<p>Now if he pulls out before the match, I assume he doesn't get the money and the guy replacing him would get it.</p>

<p>But what would if he limps onto the court and plays one point and retires, would he pocket 50k for doing that or would he need to play up to a certain point (eg. similar to some betting agencies, which will only honour as having played if the match lasted beyond the first set)?</p>

<p>How about if this is not the first round but after the tournament has progressed and therefore there is no one to replace him. Would he still get the prize money and points even if he retires? So say, the player wins the 3rd round then pulls out of the tournament, would he get the same prize money and points as someone losing in the 4th round?</p>

"Why did the NHL move to the current playoff format?","<p>16 teams make it to the playoffs each season, 8 from each conference.
Until a few years ago, within a conference the number 1 seed would face the number 8, number 2 would face number 7, 6 vs 3, and 4 vs 5.</p>

<p>Under the current format, teams face division opponents. Each conference get 2 wild cards. The top seed of the divisions play the wild cards, and the 2nd and 3rd ranked team within each division play a series. Then there will be a division championship followed by the conference championship.</p>

<p>Eventhough the current format promotes divisional rivalry, it seems very unfair. As of March 27 2017, the top 3 teams of the NHL - Washington Capitals, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins - are all in the same division. This means that one of the top 3 teams is guaranteed to be eliminated after the first round of the playoffs when the 2nd and 3rd rank teams of this division face in the first round. This also allows for lower quality teams to enter the playoffs in the weaker division.</p>

<p>So given the above argument, I'm wondering why the NHL has stuck to this format? I can understand they wanted a change and came up with this system. But the system is clearly flawed. So why doesn't the NHL come up with another scheme or revert back to the old format?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I say ""clearly flawed"" since there is a huge difference in the strength of the teams playing in the postseason. The league is trying the maximize the parity of the teams getting and moving forward in the postseason. But the current format benefits weak divisions and disfavours strong divisions. Back to my example, with a very high probability one of the 2nd or 3rd best teams in the NHL is guaranteed to exit the playoffs in the first round. There has been a long discussion whether any team in the Atlantic division really wants the 1st position. The division winner will most likely face New York Rangers, the Wild Card from the Metropolitan division who have more points than any team in the Atlantic. Hence finishing 2nd in the Atlantic division gives the division champion a much easier road to get to the Stanley Cup final.</p>

"Illegal Substitution and Awarded Goal","<p>This is about an awarded goal on an illegal substitution in NHL hockey, or what I think would make for one. This has to do with an illegal substitute trying to stop disaster from occuring. Call it a kneejerk reaction. I only ask you use your imagination; I know this is the very definition of uncommon. But that's what I do, ask the uncommon questions no one wants to ask because they have wives and lives.</p>

<p>A team has its goalie pulled, either for a delayed penalty or at the end of the game; while in the attacking zone, they pass the puck back to the point, only to have it missed by the point man and head toward the unoccupied goal. Would it be an awarded goal if an illegal substitute from that team enters the game off the bench to race to stop the puck from going into the net somewhere in the neutral or defending zone?</p>

<p>The rule for illegal substitution has a clause in it for an awarded goal when the goalie is removed. However, it only takes into account a case where a ""player"" of the side attacking the ""unattended goal"" is interfered with in the neutral or attacking zone. It says nothing of the puck or its movements. So that's no good.</p>

<p>Rule 56.7 seems to support this, almost perfectly. It says, ""If when the goalkeeper has been removed from the ice, any member of his team (including the goalkeeper) not legally on the ice, including the Coach or non-playing Club personnel, interferes by means of his body, stick or any other object or piece of equipment with the movements of the puck or an opposing player in the neutral or attacking zone, the Referee shall immediately award a goal to the non-offending team.""</p>

<p>I'm guessing the above scenario is covered by this, since an illegal sub is not ""legally"" on the ice. I think the spirit of the rule is for obstruction from the bench, but it bolsters my case as well. The actual rule for illegal substitution doesn't say this - it's located under interference. Am I right with my analysis?</p>

"Do minor penalties become penalty shots when there is ""insufficient playing time""?","<p>A couple of situations that call for minor penalties in the rulebook become penalty shots if they are committed when there is ""insufficient playing time"" to serve them (applies to regulation and overtime). For example, one situation is a defending player displacing the goal frame intentionally; from the <a href=""http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2017-2018-NHL-rulebook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2017-2018 Rulebook, Rule 63.5, Penalty Shot</a>:</p>

  player for deliberately displacing his own goal post cannot be served
  in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or at any time
  in overtime, a penalty shot shall be awarded against the offending
  team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that 1:59 or less must be remaining in regulation for a minor penalty to become a penalty shot? Technically, the rule doesn't even mention two minutes; it mentions ""insufficient playing time."" Does this mean if two minutes remain exactly, the minor penalty can be served in its entirety?</p>

"Elimination system where both opponents can lose","<p>Is there any tournament system that deals with the fact that both opponents can lose? Or is there an easy, non-complicated and fair way of modifying an elimination-like system to deal with it?</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing in historical fencing (HEMA). In this type of fencing, we want to strongly discourage so-called double hits, i.e. a situation in which both opponents hit each other at approximately the same time.</p>

<p>When we do tournaments, there are several options of dealing with double hits. The simplest one is that a double hit is a point for both opponents but that does not discourage the double hits, on the contrary, it encourages it in some situations (one of the opponents is one point from victory while the other one is not).</p>

<p>Another system is that double hits are not counted at all. This is a bit better but it can lengthen the matches.</p>

<p>The last system is that double hits are punished by both opponents losing (either right away or after some amount of double hits). This last option is closest to what we would want - it punishes double hits and can be scaled depending on the experience of the contestants (by the amount of double hits allowed). However it has one <strong>major drawback</strong>: it works only in round-robin-like tournament systems and any elimination-like system is broken by the fact that both opponents should lose. Hence my question.</p>

"Responsibility of the batsman to be ready for the bowler","<p>Is there a rule that states that a batsman must be ready for the bowler, or is it just good etiquette? I'm not referring to waiting for a new bat to come in after a wicket has fallen. I'm talking about a bowler having to wait for the batsman mid-over, to get ready to receive the next delivery.</p>

<p>In a recent match, the bowler was bowling off a 10 yard run up. For every ball, a particular batsman was waiting 3-4 yards leg side of the wicket. He waited for the bowler to get to his mark and be ready to start the delivery, before he then walked into the crease and took his guard to receive the ball.  This was adding a slight delay to every ball, and (perhaps intentionally) annoying the entire field!</p>

<p>On occasion this would be fine, but this batsman did it every single ball. I was always taught that it is the batsman's responsibility to be ready for the bowler (assuming the batsman has reasonable time). In this case, with the bowler having a 10 yard run-up there was always plenty of time for the batsman to get ready. </p>

<p>I have scoured the rules but can't find anything that explicitly states one way or the other. All I can find under the dead ball rules is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Law 20.5 Ball ceases to be dead.</p>
  
  <p>The ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his/her run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his/her bowling action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and under 20.4.2 Either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it.  Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not count as one of the over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that unless the batsman has a good reason not to be ready, he has to be ready to receive the ball. ""adequate reasons"" is a bit vague - there are many adequate reasons that could fit in here, but if the batsman's batting mannerisms are simply that he likes to wait for the bowler to be ready, then surely that doesn't apply? </p>

<p>Was it reasonable for the batsman to oblige the bowler to have to wait for him to be ready every single delivery, or, given there was no adequate reason, could the bowler have legitimately just started bowling? </p>

<p>Where in the rules does it govern who has to be ready for who?</p>

For example, if you look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Current_Top_10_Men%27s_Road_Rankings_-_Individual&amp;oldid=843632476"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current UCI World Ranking</a> and this year's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2018_UCI_World_Tour&amp;oldid=843989654#Points_standings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UCI World Tour rankings</a>, you can see Froome with 4918.13 and 1205.43 points, Van Avermaet with 2734.57 and 993.57 points. </p>

<p>However, when I look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_World_Ranking#Explanation_of_the_new-for-2016_points_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explanation of UCI ranking points</a> at Wikipedia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCI_World_Ranking&amp;oldid=839300417#Explanation_of_the_new-for-2016_points_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current revision</a>), the points awarded for various placings are never fractions. So the best guess is that under some circumstances points are divided between several riders. Checking ranking breakdown for <a href=""https://dataride.uci.ch/iframe/RiderRankingDetails/43936?rankingId=1&amp;groupId=1&amp;momentId=26948&amp;baseRankingTypeId=1&amp;disciplineSeasonId=89&amp;disciplineId=10&amp;categoryId=22&amp;raceTypeId=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Froome</a> and <a href=""https://dataride.uci.ch/iframe/RiderRankingDetails/44513?rankingId=1&amp;groupId=1&amp;momentId=26948&amp;baseRankingTypeId=1&amp;disciplineSeasonId=89&amp;disciplineId=10&amp;categoryId=22&amp;raceTypeId=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Van Avermaet</a> I see that in these instances the non-integer points come from team time trials. (I am not sure to which extent these links are permanent, so I will explicitly mention that Froome has 1.43 points from TTT at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Tirreno%E2%80%93Adriatico"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tirreno–Adriatico</a>, where Team Sky finished 3rd. Van Avermaet has 8.57 from exactly the same event, BMC Racing Team won this stage.)</p>

<p>Is team time trial the only possibility when points are divided between several riders? What are the exact rules how the points from TTT (or some other situations where the points are split between several riders) are divided among riders?</p>

"My ping-pong paddle's rubber broke. How can I prevent this?","<p>I was playing ping-pong the other day. Little did I know at the time, my rubber was slowly coming off with every stroke of my paddle. When I was about to close out the game, I attempted to smash but twice, my balls died on the return and didn't clear the net. Knowing this was unusual, I checked out my paddle and saw a quarter of my rubber detached from my paddle with a slight tear. I still was able to win, but not without adjustments. This has happened during practice, but never during the heat of the moment. I'm considering replacing my paddle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If neither team has taken a timeout prior to 6:59 of the  period, it shall be mandatory for the Official Scorer to take it at the first dead ball and charge it to the home team. If no subsequent timeouts are taken prior to 2:59, it shall be mandatory for the Official Scorer to take it and charge it to the team not previously charged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the question I have is what happens if both the home and road teams have taken a timeout in the first 5 minutes of a quarter, and there are no other taken timeouts? Certainly, in this case, there is no timeout charged at the first dead ball after the 7:00 mark. Because there are no subsequent timeouts, one of the teams must be charged with a timeout on a dead ball at the 3:00 mark, but which one will be charged with this timeout. Or, would this be scored as an officials's timeout?</p>

"How long was the longest given extra time in a half in football?","<p>While watching a World Cup game, I noticed how the extra time given at the end of the first half is usually shorter than the extra time given at the end of the second half.

<blockquote>
  <p>""When Brentford played away at Bristol City in 2000-01, there were about 23 minutes of stoppage time in the first-half alone after a broken leg, a dislocated shoulder (Bees striker Lloyd Owusu passed out from the pain and an ambulance had to be driven up to the pitch), and serious concussion caused the delay,"" noted Will. ""In fact, two goals were scored in that first-half injury-time, with the second being clocked in the 67th minute, I believe. The fourth official had originally held up 13 minutes' stoppage time, but one of the injuries occurred in that period to bump it up to 23. I'd be surprised if there were many games that contained more added-on time!""</p>

On the downswing, the shaft has a tendency to flex from backwards to forwards.

"How can footballers head or hit the ball so high?","<p>In football(soccer), we often see defenders heading the ball almost 25-30 yards, and seemingly light touches taking the ball very high.

"Football field: Defensive goal line ""plane"" is actually the back of the painted line?","<p>In the NFL and presumably in most football leagues, the goal lines, yard lines, and hash marks are all four inches wide.   The hash marks/yard lines are 
painted at 36-inch intervals; that is, they are 32 inches apart so that they mark exactly one yard each.   Easy enough. </p>

<p>However, doesn't this make the field between goal lines exactly 99 yards and 32 inches from goal line to goal line?  It is <em>less than</em> one hundred yards, right? </p>

<p>Since that cannot be,  I must conclude that the <strong>rear</strong> of the defensive goal line is the actual defensive goal line. <strong>Am I right?</strong></p>

<p>Come to think of it, this would be consistent with how balls are spotted.   On a touchback, for example, the ball is spotted with the nose just kissing the back edge of the 20-yard line. Thus a ball spotted at the one-yard line would just kiss the painted hash mark, and so a ball spotted at the one-inch line would be three inches behind the front of the goal line, which we normally think of as ""in the end zone,"" but it must not be so. </p>

<p>I suppose it would only matter in the question of a loss of yards from scrimmage or a terrible kick return within four inches of the goal line.  If a ball carrier is down by contact with the nose of the ball spotted three inches behind the front plane of the defensive team's goal line, this must not be a safety/touchback, right? That is, the ball <strong>can</strong> be spotted for a play from scrimmage with its nose at three inches behind the front of the painted goal line (one inch from the back of the painted goal line), from which the offense would have to advance 99 yards and 35 inches for a touchdown.  Is this right? </p>

"Dealing with tension and poor behaviour among teammates","<p>I am the captain of a quidditch team, ""muggle quidditch"" if you prefer, experiencing a few more or less regular issues with some of my players.
We play a recent sport that puts together athletes from very different backgrounds, I believe this makes it in some ways comparable to youth leagues: while the average player is a college student, most teams don't have a coach, or the coach is just another player, or someone of similar age and experience as other players in the team. This lack of the typical authoritative figure exacerbates problems that are normally solved by the presence of the coach.</p>

<p>So for an example of the problematic ""types"" of players, I found myself with...</p>

<ol>
<li>Experienced athletes who have played other competitive sports and
have an ego problem.</li>
<li>Experienced athletes who have occasional
instinctive outbursts towards opponents and teammates, but otherwise
fit in well. In other words, normal athletes.</li>
<li>Less experienced
athletes who may be more or less good, with some previous sports
experiences - generally at amateur level - who overestimate their
abilities.</li>
<li>Unexperienced players at their first sporting experience.</li>

<ul>
<li>on the field 1. and 2. don't mix well with 3. and 4.: the latter don't react well to the more experienced athletes' yelling, sometimes resulting in a buildup of tension, back and forth yelling, loss of concentration, in other cases loss of confidence</li>
<li>on and off the field 1., 3. and 4. don't always react well to constructive criticism from teammates and respond either aggressively or by ignoring directions; in the case of 4. specifically, more often than not they'll make up excuses for not trying something, or after failing a first time, and lose confidence</li>

<p>Some bating teams have relatively more of left-or right-handed batters. So use one pitcher against the one set of teams and the other pitcher against the other set of teams. Jeff Locke and Brandon Cumpton of Pittsburgh come to mind. One is a lefty and one is a righty.</p>

<p>Are there any teams that in fact, do this, because they have ""fifth"" starters on the roster who throw a lot better against either left- or right handed batters? Perhaps combined with another back end starter who has ""platoon"" splits the other way? Meaning that it would make sense to ""platoon"" a ""backend"" starter role so that the tandem may actually be better than a fifth starter?</p>

"Can a pitcher throw a strike during an intentional walk?","<h2>Intentional Walk</h2>

<p>I know that there have been times where a pitcher has thrown a ball over the plate enough for a hitter to get a hit, and even hit a home run in some cases.  My question is more along the lines of:</p>

<p>If he throws one over the plate and in the strike zone, and the hitter does not swing, is it a strike?  </p>

<p>Is there anything in the rule book saying that a catcher cannot deke the hitter by standing up and signaling for an intentional walk and then having the pitcher throw a strike?</p>

<hr>

<p>This would be frowned upon as far as ""unwritten rules"" go, and someone would probably get hit by a pitch as a result.  I haven't seen it happen, but it could be a strategy against a good hitter in a big game (ie- playoffs, world series, etc).</p>

"Walkoff homer, decisive run scores but following runner leaves base path","<p>This question is a hypothetical based on the last play of Game 5 of the 2014 NLCS.</p>

<p>San Francisco batting in the bottom of the 9th, score tied 3-3, runners Arias at second and Belt at first, one out.  Batter Ishikawa hits a home run out of the playing field.  As Ishikawa trots around third, he is mobbed by his teammates from the dugout.  In the actual event, he pushed them out of the way to touch home plate, and the game ended with a score of 6-3.  But what if he had not?</p>

<p>I understand that a batter who hits a home run out of the playing field must touch all bases in order for the run to count, and if he fails to do so he can be called out on appeal at the missed base.  I also understand that if he leaves the base path he is out.  But in this case, the preceding runners Arias and Belt have already scored, so the game is apparently won anyway.</p>

<p>If Ishikawa had left the base path before touching home plate (but after Arias and Belt had scored), what would have happened?  My guess is he would be called out and the game would be over with a score of 5-3, but I can't find this addressed in the official MLB rules.  (Also, would Ishikawa be in the unusual position of being credited with a HR and 2 RBI but no R?)</p>

<p>A comment on Rule 7.08(a) discusses a related case: if the leading runner leaves the base path, he is out, and if he makes the third out, the trailing runner does not score and the game continues.  But it doesn't address what happens if the leading runner scores and then the trailing runner leaves the base path.</p>

<p>As another variation, what if Arias scores, and then Belt and Ishikawa both leave the base path?  If they are both out then that would make three out.  Does Arias's run count and end the game at 4-3, or does it not, and we go to the top of the 10th still tied 3-3?</p>

"Probabilities of winning as a function of sets played","<p>In tennis, what are the probabilities of winning a player has as a function of sets played?
Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>1-0 in a 3 set game</li>
<li>2-1 in a 5 set game</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you include psychology (such as winning the last set may give you an edge) and conditional probabilities (the best player may have a better chance of winning the second set than the first) the state is a bit more detailed. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Player A won the first set in a 3 set game</li>
<li>AB in a 3 set game</li>
<li>AABB in a 5 set game</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know (a subset of) these statistics?</p>

"Can a football team force its defeat, e.g. via own goals?","<p>On Thursday at 2pm GMT, the football matches for group H of the World Cup 2018 will begin. By 4 pm GMT, the fate of that group will be decided. </p>

<p>Let us assume that Japan comes first and Colombia comes second (not an unlikely outcome, actually), both hence qualifying for the second round. Now, at 6pm GMT, the matches of group G begin. Belgium and England are already qualified for the next round, but they play against each other in order to decide who goes first, and thus, to decide whom are they to play in the next round. </p>

<p>Now, under the reasonable assumption that Colombia is a better team than Japan (which is the case in terms of both Fifa ranking and world cup experience), you would expect Belgium and England would like to play Japan in the next round. Not only this, but <strong>coming second of the group will mean avoiding Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay, Portugal, and/or France in the next rounds up to the final</strong>. In the other side of the qualifications, the only big teams are Spain and Croatia. As such, there is <strong>a huge incentive for Belgium and England to come second of the group</strong>. </p>

<p>Now, the only certain way for a team to come second is <strong>to lose the match</strong> (they are tied in everything else, and qualifying position might depend on a Fair Play ranking, which changes during their match anyway). </p>

<p>This scenario is quite strange. It is not that both directly benefit (and thus put effort) in a draw, but quite the opposite: they benefit from a defeat! Thus, you could imagine both putting no effort, or playing only with substitutes, or even, if they remain in a tie, to score an own-goal in the last minute of extra-time! I would imagine that all this is perfectly legal, but is it? Can a team be investigated for this behaviour? Presumably, football rules are tailored to foster competitive behaviour, i.e. to foster a win. Perhaps there are rules against evident own-goals to induce defeat?</p>

<p>The problem with this arrangement, as mentioned in the question, is that England and Belgium can be unsportsmanlike in order to receive a more favorable opponent in the next round.</p>

<p>I know that the teams involved in unsportsmanlike behavior can be investigated and punished, but still, why FIFA not just decided to start all four matches simultaneously? This would reduce the possibility of deliberate losing.</p>

<p>Another alternative solution is that FIFA can consider to let all the qualifying teams to draw the lots again after all group matches complete, so that no one can ""choose the opponent"", why this is not done?</p>

"In which match did Djokovic successfully challenge a call but give away the point?","<p>In which match did the following happen? (I can't for the life of me find it.)</p>

<p>Djokovic hit a backhand hard crosscourt from inside the service box, approximately on the left tramline. Nadal was right on the baseline, guessed correctly which way Djokovic was going and hit a trademark Rafa forehand down the line for a winner (Djokovic was nowhere near, since he was in the left service box, but the forehand went deep down the opposite tramline).</p>

<p>However, the ball was called out on Rafa's baseline. Djokovic challenged, only for it to be shown to be in; Rafa was suitably annoyed, given that he'd hit a clear winner. The call didn't really affect Nadal either, since Nadal basically half-volleyed it. Djokovic, very sportingly, gifts the point to Nadal, saying that indeed Nadal hit the ball for a winner.</p>

<p>This is the most pointless challenge I've ever seen: challenge; be right; give away point. (Maybe Djokovic instinctively challenged? then realised Nadal had won the point anyway.)</p>

"Why data-driven approach to soccer is slow to catch on?","<p>A lot of Baseball teams are using data-driven approach and computer modelling to help them better succeed in games. The most famous example being Billy Beane of Oakland Athletics (2001-2003), popularized by the film <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moneyball</a>. </p>

<p>My question is why soccer or football is very slow to warm up to this approach?  In an interview Billy Beane <a href=""https://www.fourfourtwo.com/my/features/fourfourtwo-billy-beane-can-moneyball-analytics-approach-work-football"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">said that</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s a very dynamic sport. Baseball is very stop-start and it lends
  itself to measurement, but on the flip side there are a lot more
  events going on during a football match than there are in a baseball
  game - and anybody who is well versed in modelling, whether from a
  computer science background or a mathematics background, will tell you
  the more data you have, the better you are able to put the models
  together.</p>
  
  <p>“So it may be different and there’s certainly a correlation of an
  interaction between players that may not exist in baseball – but there
  are a lot of events, and the more events you have the better you
  should be at predicting things.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've no idea what these words mean. On one moment he said that football has a lot more events, and on the other moment he said that the more data the better for data driven approach. So I guess more events should lead to more data which means that football should be amenable to data-driven approach, right?</p>

<p>In addition to whatever he was saying, is there any other reasons why football is slower to warm up to data-driven approach?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> the question <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/q/2487/4799"">How are football players are objectively rated</a> is related, but not necessarily a duplicate as suggested. Reason being, data-driven approach is not necessarily limited to sports where individual players can be objectively rated. In fact football is a collective sport where individual talents are less important than team dynamics. I can easily imagine that we find other team-related metrics, as opposed to individual metrics, that are more amenable to data-driven analysis. </p>

<p>So no, it's not a duplicate at all. </p>

"When can you lift your pivot foot and go for a shot?","<p>I was called for a travel in just a pick up game a couple months ago. I was also reading on Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_(basketball)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">information about the travel rule</a> about the situation and it seems that there are conflicting rules.</p>

<p>There are 3 scenarios I need to consider. </p>

<h3>Scenario 1:</h3>

<p>Staggered landing, with a pivot foot, after receiving the ball for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Can you lift your pivot foot (using your other foot to jump off obviously) to try to shoot the basketball OR pass the ball? I'm aware that you cannot lift your pivot foot before ""releasing the ball to start a dribble"". </p>

<p>I know that if you have gathered the ball into a staggered landing, AFTER dribbling, you can go for a shot/pass while lifting your pivot foot and your non pivot foot still on the ground. But the difference here is that you have not dribbled at all after first receiving the ball.  </p>

<h3>Scenario 2:</h3>

<p>""True Jump Stop"" where you have <strong>received</strong> the ball on 1 foot, then jumped and landed on 2 feet. In this case </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>I know that you cannot lift either foot, before ""releasing the ball to start the dribble"". <strong>HOWEVER</strong> If you were to go for a shot, I'm pretty sure you could jump off both feet in this case, and go for a jump shot. BUT are you able to lift just 1 foot, before the other, the other then goes into the air then go for a shot, OR lift just 1 foot while the other is still on the ground then go for a shot? </p>

<h3>Scenario 3:</h3>

<p>""True Jump Stop"" where you have already dribbled, you gather the ball on 1 foot, then jump and land on both feet simultaneously. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Similar to the question in scenario 2. Are you able go for a shot by lifting 1 foot off the ground followed by the other? Or go for a shot by lifting 1 foot, and keep the other foot ON the ground?</p>

<hr>

<p>The confusion all arises after I read this quote on Wikipedia for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_(basketball)#FIBA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FIBA traveling rules</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there is no paragraph 4.a of Section 72. Therefore, it is a violation if the player, after coming to a stop and establishing the pivot foot, lifts it before the other foot without a dribble.</p>

"What are the advantages/disadvantages of the triangle formation?","<p>Based on limited research that I've done recently, it seems that the triangle formation is an attacking formation used primarily by midfielders to advance the ball by forming a rotating triangle pattern on the field and exploiting the many passing lanes that it can create in the defense. Is this understanding correct?</p>

<p>What kinds of things are important when trying to execute the triangle? (good passing, good dribbling, fast, disciplined, etc...)</p>

<p>What formations or techniques do coaches and players use to stop teams that rely heavily on the triangle?</p>

"How is the slashing rule enforced in hockey?","<p>From the <a href=""http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26353"" rel=""nofollow"">NHL rulebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>61.1 Slashing</strong> - Slashing is the act of a player swinging his stick at an opponent, whether contact is made or not. Non-aggressive stick
  contact to the pant or front of the shin pads, should not be penalized
  as slashing. Any forceful or powerful chop with the stick on an
  opponent’s body, the opponent’s stick, or on or near the opponent’s
  hands that, in the judgment of the Referee, is not an attempt to play
  the puck, shall be penalized as slashing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my interpretations of the rule above, slashing seems somewhat subjective - it depends on whether the referee feels that a player was attempting to play the puck. </p>

<p>Assuming that a player is playing the puck, will hockey referees ignore any contact to an opponent, even if the chop is aggressive or forceful? How much does the rule's intent to reduce injury risk affect these types of calls?</p>

<p>The MLB <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp"">rule reference</a> (8.06):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8.06</strong> A professional league shall adopt the following rule pertaining to the visit of the manager or coach to the pitcher: </p>
  
  <p>(a) This rule
  limits the number of trips a manager or coach may make to any one
  pitcher in any one inning; </p>
  
  <p>(b) A second trip to the same pitcher in
  the same inning will cause this pitcher's automatic removal; </p>
  
  <p>(c) The

  while the same batter is at bat, but </p>
  
  <p>(d) if a pinch-hitter is

"Forefoot landing at certain pace","<p>I have run several with traditional heel landings.

"Which Marathons to run?","<p>For many years, one of my major ""running"" dreams have been to run the <a href=""http://www.nycmarathon.org/"">New York Marathon</a> - the bridges, the people and the grand background.

<p>The question is then, which Marathons I should aim at if not New York? What are the great Marathons out there that one must do if possible?  Like the almost impossible ones such as <a href=""http://www.saharamarathon.co.uk/"">Marathon des Sables</a> or the <a href=""http://www.icemarathon.com/"">Antarctic Ice Marathon</a>?

"What is a gentle reminder to a squash opponent to stop an ongoing evaluation?","<p>Although the question applies to many sports, I'm seeking an answer in the particular context of the <strong>rules</strong> and <strong>culture</strong> of <strong>squash</strong>. Is the answer formally specified in the competition rules of squash? Is the (worldwide) culture established firmly enough for the question to have a universal answer? In case it matters, I'm talking here about international, not US, squash.</p>

<p>I occasionally play against a opponent who likes to comment. This happens in many variations, but the main one is that if I make a difficult shot, they'll comment ""nice shot"", perhaps after they themselves have missed the return.</p>

<p>If this pat-on-the-back is made two or three times in a game, and after particularly strong play, I find that it's a nice compliment. But if the comments are made incessantly, for just about every rather-ordinary successful shot, the comments rattle me. I'm not sure if other players are capable of putting up with an ongoing evaluation. I'm not sure if a player ought to be able to handle some evaluation without being rattled. This is, after all, not chess. In chess, at least when I played semi-seriously a long time ago, a player would automatically lose a formal game if they spoke and told their opponents ""nice move"". It's understood that this will destroy the focus of one's opponent.</p>

<p>In squash I can never tell whether the comments are (intentionally or unintentionally) malicious. But I do know that they affect the ongoing game.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a formal rule in squash that prevents an opponent from making a comment at all, at least until the game is over.</li>

"Why do pitchers walk other pitchers (in the National League) with some frequency?","<p>In asking this question, I am not referring to exceptional cases like Yovani Gallardo, Madison Bumgarner, or Jake Arrieta, who hit about as well as position players. But I am referring to ""most"" pitchers, whose batting averages are in the .100s, about half as high as average position players. </p>

<p>I read somewhere that there is a theoretical batting average below which it was right to <em>always</em> throw strikes because the chances of getting the person out was so high that it was worthwhile not to give him a chance to walk, and as a practical matter, there was a somewhat higher threshold below which it made sense to throw mostly strikes, thereby giving the batter a minimal chance to walk.</p>

<p>My best recollection is that the rule is that one should ""never"" walk a batter (incurring a sure loss) whose average was below .075 even if he all home runs, and that it made sense to never walk a batter with an average as high as .225 if he never made extra base hits.</p>

<p>Don't most National League pitchers fall beneath these thresholds as batters? (Or if I have stated them wrongly, the ""corrected"" ones?) So why do pitchers often throw enough balls to walk them, when they could get them out by throwing mostly strikes?</p>

"Did an athlete lap the rest of the runners after an illness that left him in bed for a long time before the competition?","<p>I recall reading some time ago a rather inspiring and interesting story about the importance of rest while training for a sport.</p>

Back in those days, stated the text I read, runners would train hard without interleaving some resting days. Apparently, the benefits of rest were undiscovered, so they assumed that the more your trained, the better the results would be.</p>

<p>However, that specific athlete had some serious health problem about a month before the race, leading him to remain at bed for a couple of weeks. Obviously, he could not train in all this period and he was very concerned about losing all his fitness for the race.</p>

<p>Despite this fear, the athlete decided to go and run the race, and then it became obvious that his fitness wasn't worse but way better: not even did he win the race, but he even lapped the rest of the runners (that is, they were more than 400 m after him).</p>

<p>I remember reading this some years ago in a book, but cannot recall more than the details I already mentioned. Some may be even wrong (maybe it was not in the 50s and maybe it was another championship). Since I somehow assumed he as Finnish, I did some research on some long-distance runners like Paavo Nurmi, but nothing arose from that.</p>

"Batting average greater than on-base percentage","<p>While watching a New York Mets game early this season, before one plate appearance the broadcast graphics displayed that catcher John Buck had a batting average (AVG) of .400 and an on-base percentage (OBP) of .396. Several games later I saw a similar phenomenon for Buck, whose OBP was again several points lower than his AVG. (In other words, the stats presented were very likely to be actual and not an on-screen typo.)</p>

<p>How is this possible? By my understanding, the two are calculated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>AVG = (hits) / (at-bats)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>OBP = (times reaching first base) / (plate appearances)
</code></pre>

"In football, what happens when a team commits an offence for which play need not be stopped, and then scores a goal immediately after?","<p>In the <a href=""http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/661/133139_290518_LotG_18_19_EN_DoublePage_150dpi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laws of the Game</a>, there is a small—yet non empty—set of offences for which the referee must not immediately blow his whistle as he usually does for 'normal' fouls, but must instead allow play to continue, and caution the guilty player when the ball is next out of play.</p>

<p>Examples of such offences include swicthing places with the goalkeeper without informing the referee beforehand (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-players-2018/chapters/offences-and-sanctions-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 3.5</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s permission, the referee (...) <strong><em>cautions both players when the ball is next out of play</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or making unauthorized marks on the field of play (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-field-of-play-2018/chapters/field-markings-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 1.2</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A player who makes unauthorised marks on the field of play must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour. If the referee notices this being done during the match, <strong><em>the player is cautioned when the ball next goes out of play.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are infringements that do not naturally carry a restart with them (e.g. indirect free kick, direct free kick, dropped ball, etc.), since the Laws explicitly forbid the match officials from interrupting the game to deal with them, and only instruct the referee to issue the appropriate disciplinary sanction afterwards.</p>

<p>This said, let's move onto Law 10 (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/determining-the-outcome-of-a-match-2018/chapters/goal-scored-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 10.1</a>). Here we can read that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, <strong><em>provided that no offence has been committed by the team scoring the goal</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, it's obvious that this paragraph is only referring to those offences that are committed between the restart of play that is chronologically the closest to when the goal is scored and the goal itself, otherwise a team who commits a foul in the first minute of play would be forbidden from scoring a valid goal for the whole duration of the match.</p>

<p>So, to make an example, if a substitute enters the field of play just seconds before his team scores a goal, said goal must be disallowed, and play restarts with a direct free kick from the position of the extra person (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-players-2018/chapters/goal-scored-with-an-extra-person-on-the-field-of-play-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 3.9</a>) because this is the kind of penalty that is carried by the offence of entering the pitch without the referee's permission (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-players-2018/chapters/extra-persons-on-the-field-of-play-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 3.7</a>).</p>

<p>But what about the offences I mentioned at the beginning of my question? There's not a specific restart of play attached to them. So, what do you do if a player makes unauthorized marks on the field of play just before his team scores a goal? What if a defender changes places with the goalkeeker without telling the referee, and then the new goalkeeper handles the ball within his penalty area, and throws it with the hands in such a powerful way that it directly enters the opponents' goal? It's obvious that such goals cannot be allowed, but how should play restart?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should the match be resumed with an indirect free kick, on the basis that play was interrupted to show a card to a player who was guilty of an offence that is not mentioned in Law 12 (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/fouls-and-misconduct-2018/chapters/indirect-free-kick-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 12.2</a>)? Though the game was technically <strong>NOT</strong> stopped to caution the player—it was stopped because the ball entered one of the goals; the Laws forbid the referee from stopping play solely to deal with these offences, after all. And anyway, where should this free kick be taken? From inside the goal area?</li>
<li>Should play restart with a goal kick/corner kick, on the basis that the ball crossed the goal line, but a goal was not scored (<a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-goal-kick-2018/chapters/the-goal-kick-introduction-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 16 Introduction</a>, <a href=""http://theifab.com/laws/the-corner-kick-2018/chapters/the-corner-kick-introduction-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law 17 Introduction</a>)? If so, when is it a goal kick and when is it a corner kick? Should it depend on which player touched the ball last before it entered the goal, as is the case for 'normal' situations involving goal kicks/corner kicks?</li>

"Why is a penalty not given if a goal comes right after the foul?","<p>In the game between Spain and Russia, in the World Cup 2018, one Russian defender (Ignashevich) tackled a Spanish player (Ramos) inside the Russian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">penalty area</a> (video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmg5rXVzjDo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_vhi7_Wik"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). This was technically a foul, and thus a penalty for Spain. However, right after the tackle, the ball hit Ignashevich and entered the Russian goal. Thus, it was an own goal. </p>

<p>Now, in terms of timing, the foul happened before the goal. Thus, why is a penalty not given? Why give the goal to Spain, instead of giving them the <em>chance</em> to score, but without 100% probability of doing so? Surely, if the time difference between the foul and the own-goal had been longer, the referee would have given the penalty. But if so, isn't this just an arbitrary application of the rules?</p>

<p><em>Update (based on comment asking for more info)</em>:</p>

<p>Why would the foul be given before the goal awarded? Because technically, the foul happened first. You can think of the strict rule being something like ""IF foul, THEN penalty"", whereas in practice it seems more like ""IF foul AND goal AND goal-foul > epsilon, then penalty"". Thus, only if the time difference is long enough would the penalty be given. But if epsilon is small enough (so the goal happens just after the foul), then the goal is given. This seems to me arbitrary. Sure, there are technical limitations involved in the referee (e.g. when epsilon is too small, the referee has little capacity to react in time). But the current approach seems to be based on assumptions by players that, if a goal happens after a penalty foul, it will be awarded. Maybe the VAR can precisely help to reduce the arbitrariness of rules like this.</p>

"Why do footballers (and coaches) cover their mouth when speaking to each other?","<p>You can see this for instance when players discuss a free kick, or talk to the referee, or when talking to a colleague on the pitch. I understand the fear of being spied on by someone and communicating information to the opponent. But really? Has this ever been a thing? I mean, no one can pass such quickly passed information to anyone. For example, when two players discuss a free-kick, no one will be able to inform the goalkeeper of anything. </p>

<p>And also, can untrained people really read the lips of other players so easily, especially if it is in another language? Players might suspect a translator off the pitch, perhaps looking with binoculars, could help with the translation, but again, this information, if ever accurate, could be very slow to transmit, and hence become useless.</p>

<p>So, the real question is, why bother? Has such information ever been used against a team? This trend in covering the mouth became widespread, in my experience, around 5 years ago. Thus, for example, in most World Cups ever played, this was not a thing. Why the sudden concern? Does FIFA have anything to say about this?</p>

"Why do many tennis players crouch-then-uncrouch before receiving a serve?","<p>I’ve been watching quite a lot of tennis this year, and I’ve been noticing a tendency among many professional tennis players—particularly noticeable in women players, for some reason—to crouch down fairly low when waiting for their opponent to serve, and then straighten halfway back up just before the opponent actually serves.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ftptennis.net/ftp-tennis-college/ftp-tennis-college-courses/technical-tennis/the-forehand/section-03-the-ready-position/section-04-the-ready-position-common-mistakes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This FTP Tennis page</a> describes crouching down too low as a common ready-position mistake, borne out of people observing this precise crouch, but missing the player straightening back up.</p>

<p>For reference, here are two pictures of Novak Ðoković in the two positions in question, taken from the same page:</p>

<p>Crouching:<br>

<p>Straightening:<br>

<p>Given that the player usually ends up in a ready position which is almost identical to the position they were in before they crouched down, I can’t help but wonder why they do the initial low crouch at all.</p>

<p>Why not just go directly into the final ready position? Wouldn’t that be easier?</p>

"Hasn't Kasper Schmeichel broke the rules when saving Modrić's penalty during the World Cup 2018, Round of 16 match between Croatia and Denmark?","<p><a href=""http://www.theifab.com/laws/the-penalty-kick-2018/chapters/penalty-kick-procedure-2018"" rel=""noreferrer"">Law 14 - The Penalty Kick - 1.

"Under what circumstances the half race passing time in a marathon qualifies for a half marathon competition?","<p>Few months ago, a track and field runner <a href=""https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/spain/carles-castillejo-195623"" rel=""noreferrer"">Carles Castillejo</a> was involved in something quite interesting: he wanted to qualify to the <a href=""https://www.iaafvalencia2018.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">IAAF World Half Marathon Championship 2018</a> in Valencia, Spain, to be held in March 24.</p>

<p>He tried to get the minim time in Barcelona on February 11 but he failed due to a flu: <a href=""https://edreamsmitjabarcelona.com/resultados/2018/"" rel=""noreferrer"">he ran in 1h 04:57</a>, while he needed 1h 04:30.</p>

<p>Since he felt he was capable to get the time, he managed to do so in a particular way: he ran the marathon of Seville on February 25, only that running the first half marathon in a fast pace, which would count as official time. As indicated in <a href=""https://www.maratonradio.com/podcast-running-tour-20180216-carles-castillejo-a-por-todas-en-el-zurich-maraton-sevilla"" rel=""noreferrer"">Carles Castillejo, a por todas en el Zurich Maratón Sevilla</a> <sub>Spanish, translation mine</sub>:</p>

  <p>He will be the pacemaker up to the km 15 of the race. Then, he will try to make the half marathon in 1h 04 to get the classification [to the World Half Marathon Championship]. <strong>To make a valid time he must finish the race</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As explained by the <a href=""https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/boulaid-tuwei-win-seville-marathon-2018"" rel=""noreferrer"">IAAF on Seville's marathon report</a>, this is what happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The men’s race opened at a frantic pace as the two kilometre point was reached in 5:55, ten seconds ahead of schedule. Once the organisers managed to slow the pacesetters, it was the first pacer, Spain’s Carlos Castillejo, who led the main group through 10 kilometres in 29:58. All the main favourites were tucked in behind him except for Spain’s Jesús España who opted to travel in a second group, well behind.</p>
  
  <p>Castillejo, 39, led the lead group through the halfway point in 1:03:30</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, he just managed to arrive to the end with <a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/1425198070"" rel=""noreferrer"">an approximate time of 2h 23</a>, which just did not matter.</p>

<p>So my question is: under which circumstances is this possible? What if the marathon was just going down for 21 km and then going back up?</p>

<p>Foot note: he finally could not run with his national team, due to some law interpretation problems. However, he ran the mass race just behind the professional one and managed to overtake most of the runners, as described by the IAAF in <a href=""https://www.iaaf.org/news/feature/carles-castillejo-world-half-marathon-champio"" rel=""noreferrer"">Castillejo comes out from the crowd</a>.</p>

"Why do umpires indicate whether a caught fly ball is fair or foul?","<p>If a batter pops up or flies out down a base line, and the fielder catching the ball is within a couple feet of the foul line, the umpire will always signal the out, and then ""fair"" or ""foul"" depending on where the ball is caught.</p>

If the left-fielder catches the ball in fair territory it's scored (""7"" or ""F7""); in foul territory (""7F"" or ""F7F"").

"Ineligible Man Down field on a Punt (NCAA v NFL)","<p>In college football, specifically the NCAA there are many punters that use a ""Rugby Style"" kick to punt the ball.

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Isn't this a penalty?  Only eligible receivers are allowed more than 5 yards down the field according to the rule in the NFL.  Is this not a rule in the NCAA?</strong></p>

<p>I know you cannot be a lineman and be down the field on a pass play, as in the NFL and NCAA it is a penalty.</p>

<p>I know that if the punter uses a Rugby Style punt, then the roughing the punter rules do not apply because he is not protected by the normal roughing the punter/kicker rules.  Maybe this applies to the ineligible man down field penalty too, but I cannot find anything on it.</p>

and the book ''Inverting the Pyramid'' Chapter 19.</p>

<p>They both talk about the 2005 FIFA amendment to the ofsside rule contributing to stretching the game.</p>

<p>Specifically they imply the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>The amendment means the offside player must touch the ball of block a defender for the referee to call the offside foul.</li>
<li>This discourages the team from playing high offside line and ""stretches the playing area from 35-40m to 55-60m""(from the book) and avoids ""goal hanging"" ""without the side-effect of legitimising the offside trap""(from the link)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't get that second bullet. Yes the foul is not called until the attacker goes and touched the ball, but how is that going to stop the defenders from applying the offside trap? A team would still play a high defensive line and make sure the target of the long pass is offside. All that changes now is that a foul is not called, but the attacker is still out of the play because he was offside. So why would any team be discouraged from using the offside trap?</p>

"How tightly should new snowboard boots fit?","<p>I recently bought my first pair of snowboard boots. They are Ride Riot snowboard boots, and I am not sure if I should take them back or not. I should probably mention that I have not yet worn them on the hill (once I do, I won't be able to return them). </p>

<p>They fit quite snugly. My toes are just millimeters from the end if I am sitting down or in my snowboard stance, but if I stand normally or walk around, my big toes hit the ends. </p>

<p>An immediate problem is that these boots are a men's size 13, and since these are larger sizes, it's highly unlikely that I'll find a size 13.5, so I'll probably have to jump up to a size 14. I wear a size 13 shoe, but I think I must work them in a little because according to the measurement I got at the store, my left foot is actually a size 13.5 (my right is a size 13). </p>

<p>So I guess what I want to know is, is it better to stick with these slightly small boots, or jump up to a size 14? For those more experienced in buying snowboard boots, do you find they get slightly larger after being worn on the hill a few times?</p>

"Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning?","<p>Say, teamA score is 368 (369 to win), and teamB is batting at 368 (or 366). One run (or 3 runs) will make them win. The batsman hits the ball for a six, so score is 374 (or 372) which is more than the required 369. Even then the runs are counted for the team and for the batsman.</p>

<p>Now, on the last ball, suppose the batsman did not hit a six, but ran for a single : teamB will win. Can the batsmen continue to run until the ball is dead ?</p>

<p>Why will they want this ?<br>
(A) If batsman is at 98 and wants to reach a century.<br>
(B) If batsman has a career total of 9998 and wants to reach 1000 runs.<br>
(C) If the batsman has a very high record strike rate, and wants to remain at that record strike rate.<br>
(D) In the championship, this is the last quarterfinal, &amp; even winning will put teamB equal to teamC, and the better runrate at the end of the quarterfinals will enable them to move to the semifinals.<br>
(E) Many similar situations can happen.</p>

<p>So coming back to the question : <strong>Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning ?</strong></p>

<p>In most of the matches I have seen, after winning, the batsmen do not even look where the ball is and start celebrating the win. If the rules did not allow them to run more, then fine. <strong>If the rules did allow it, then has there been any game where they did run more ?</strong></p>

The goalkeeper was able to run out to prevent the shot as they would in a one-on-one in normal play.

"Why were the Football Euro championships such small tournaments decades ago?","<p>I have looked a bit into the past of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Football European Championships</a> and I noticed that decades ago, they were really, really minuscule tournaments, if you take a look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_1972"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Euro"" 1972 in Belgium</a> for example, were only 4 teams were participating. Of course they were more teams in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_1972_qualifying"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its qualifying phase</a> but back then it seemed that the qualified teams go straight into a semi finale, whereas in Euro Championships in the more recent past, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2004"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like the one of 2004</a>, had also a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2004_qualifying"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">qualifying phase</a> but still a group phase and quarter-finals afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Why were the Euro championships so short back then in contrast to today? Was it just simply because there were less countries prior to the downfall of the USSR and Yugoslavia or were there political reasons for that, e.g. that the FIFA did not want to give another international football tournament other than the World Cup such a prominent role (hence a similar policy like the FIFA still has nowadays for Olympic Football)?</p>

  <p>A player has to win six games, and at least two more than the foe, to claim a tennis match. Players switch sides after every odd game, as in the first, third and fifth games, and so on. Players also switch sides at the end of a set if they're playing an odd number of games.</p>

<p>But what if a player wins 6-1 or 6-3? You win the set, then change sides. Now, you play a new set, do you change again at 1-0 (therefore after having played just one game), or wait until the 1-1 or 2-0, therefore now changing after an even number of games in the second set?</p>

"What prevents a player/team from agreeing to a long-term contract after the franchise tag deadline?","<p>This afternoon is the NFL franchise tag deadline. I keep hearing radio hosts talking about it as the deadline to sign a long-term deal. However, I was under the impression that once this deadline passes, the tagged player is under contract for one year, and that any player under contract with a team could agree to and sign a new contract or a contract extension with that same team at any time, 365 days a year.</p>

<p>So what rule prevents a tagged player from taking the one-year franchise tag tender and continuing to negotiate with their team after today for a better deal before the season starts, even if it is merely a contract extension? And when can they agree to a long-term contract: after the season, free agency next year, or some other time? Or am I being misled here, either by the terminology I'm hearing on the radio or by my own assumptions? </p>

"Is ""What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch"" appropriate sporting behavior?","<p>(I asked this question on IPS.SE however I have altered the question to get a different insight from more sport minded people)</p>

<p>Recently, a new friend of mine started up a 5-a-side soccer session in which a group of his friends (that I had never met) would meet up and play a game for an hour twice a week. He invited me to come along as they were short one evening about a month ago and it has been a brilliant, enjoyable few weeks playing with them. (I am the youngest player at 21, and ages range up to 40 years old)</p>

<p>When he asked me to play initially, I mentioned to him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take playing soccer very seriously and change into a different person playing, nothing I say while playing should be taken to heart and if you're okay with that I'd love to play</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I am generally easy-going although stubborn in day-to-day life, when playing football I have an innate need to win. Because of this, when playing on with or against someone that doesn't seem to be interested I will vocally (and probably borderline aggressively) tell them to come on and put some effort in while playing.</p>

<p>Generally this is taken quite well as just me being passionate while playing, however when a new person (approx. 34/35) joined the last session and I shouted to put some effort in he seemed to be quite stunned and taken aback that I had confronted him on it.</p>

<p>After each session we usually have a few drinks and chat about games etc that are on and I have made some great friends because of this, but this new guy flat out refused to speak to me after the game because he didn't want to be friends with a younger person who thinks he can boss people older than him around.</p>

<p>I tried to explain that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had no intention of bossing him around and I'm sorry he thought that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but he did not listen and has ignored me since.</p>

<p>I am not worried about making up with this person as I only see him for an hour or two at soccer a week.</p>

<p>The general consensus of the group is for a serious game but with lighthearted fun in between. Is there a way of changing a person's understanding of what I say in an interpersonal way? The rest of the group understood what I was going to be like before I played as my friend told them what I said. Is the best way to just outright say it to a new member or is there an easier/more conventional way?</p>

<p>My question is: is it okay to be overly passionate/borderline aggressive when on the pitch playing a team sport without it carrying over to off the pitch interactions?</p>

off, regardless as to which player may have last contacted the puck, 
the face-off shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be

<p>Seems fairly straightforward, but I have a question about interpretation. Does this simply mean cases where the puck is pulled out of play by one of the two centers participating in the faceoff, and the puck goes out of play without touching or deflecting off a winger or defenseman, or can the language be interpreted to include situations where the puck is drawn back by either of the centers and it immediately glances off another player on either team as a direct result of the won faceoff being drawn to them?</p>

<p>In other words, does ""directly"" refer to timing and include immediate subsequent deflections as a result of a faceoff, or does it only refer to the centers taking the draw and either of them propelling the puck out of play (non-deflected) off the faceoff? The added part about delay of game seems to support the non-deflected case. Is that Right?</p>

<p>My question is why did the pitcher throw to first instead of third? Throwing to third would have been a force out (if I'm wrong about this, then of course that answers it). Furthermore, the pitcher was right next to third base when he fielded the ball, so it seems like the safer throw. Finally, getting the out at third would have prevented at least one of the runs scoring on the next at-bat. It seems like a better play all around. But the commentators never even mentioned this possibility, and in general I almost never see force outs at third. Can someone explain to me why this is?</p>

<ol>
<li>higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question;</li>
</ol>

<p>The two matches between Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Southampton resulted in a 0-0 and 1-1, so in this case they each scored 2 points (because of the two draws).</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question;</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal difference among Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Southampton is in both matches zero.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question;</li>
</ol>

<p>In these two matches, Hapoel Be'er Sheva has scored 1 goal and Southampton also has scored 1 goal.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question;</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, Hapoel Be'er Sheva has scored 1 goal and Southampton also has scored 1 goal.</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>if, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 12 apply;</li>
<li>superior goal difference in all group matches;</li>
</ol>

<p>The superior goal difference of Southampton is +2 and that from Hapoel Be'er Sheva is 0. </p>

"Why doesn't baseball severely punish pitchers who seemingly hit batters intentionally?","<p>Time and time again, pitchers <em>intentionally</em> hit batters who show them up (or for whatever reason), yet they (the pitchers) hardly ever get seriously penalized. Further, when they are penalized, it's usually only a 4-6 game suspension (of a 100+ game season). So my question is, given how <em>incredibly</em> dangerous a pitcher's fastball is, why doesn't MLB punish pitchers harder for hitting the batter?</p>

<p>I'm aware that there are <em>""unwritten rules of the game""</em>, but honestly I think that's just an incredibly terrible excuse for bad behavior. The batter is completely defenseless, and the argument can even be made that the batter can't even properly do his job as an offensive player, due to the psychological effect of thinking that he's gonna get dinged. Parallels can be drawn between this and the NBA's rule of ""allowing shooters to come down in their space"". In the NBA, you can no longer contest a shot and move into the shooter's space, because doing this prevents them from coming down safely, and also prevents them from developing a psychological block (thinking that they're going to come down on someone's foot and twist their ankle when they go up to shoot). This leads to better shooting, better offense, and more entertainment for fans.</p>

<p>Though we can't always determine a pitcher's intention, shouldn't a reasonably hard suspension be enough to deter throwing at batters no matter what? If a pitcher knows he's gonna get a hefty suspension regardless of his intent, I feel like he'd be much more careful in his pitch placement.</p>

<p>I personally just feel like it would just be better for the game of baseball to leave out the intentional hitting of batters. So why hasn't baseball worked to change this yet? Does MLB feel like this isn't an issue? Is it just too deeply rooted in the culture for this ever to change?</p>

"Is the sweeper role obsolete with modern formations?","<p>There has been mention of a role in defense of football called ""Sweeper"". <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%28association_football%29#Sweeper_.28Libero.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> gives the following explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sweeper or libero (Italian: free) is a more versatile type of Centre back that, as the name suggests, ""sweeps up"" the ball if the opponent manages to breach the defensive line. Their position is rather more fluid than other defenders who mark their designated opponents. The sweeper's ability to read the game is even more vital than for a Centre-back. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenaccio"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>catenaccio</strong></a> system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, notably employed a defensive libero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question relates to the diagram of field positions shown below. If the sweeper is played, there will be 5 in defense. But from reading the wiki page, it seems that the sweeper's role is to read the game so that he wins the ball by tackling the opposition attackers, and also to make the forward run to start the counter attack.</p>

<p><strong>In that case isn't the role of the <em>sweeper</em> same as the defensive midfielder (DM) now, except that DM will be in front of the defenders?</strong> </p>

<p>Can we say now since the sweeper's responsibility is shared now by both the defensive midfielders and the Centre backs, the sweeper's position has become obsolete?</p>

Then, in the second half, the team that did not start with the ball in the first half gets the first possession (or TeamA-TeamB-TeamB-TeamA format for a 4 quarter game).</p>

<p>For the purpose of this question let's assume a 2 half game, because it is overall simpler, but I figure the rule associated with this situation would be similar for a 4 quarter game.</p>

<p>What happens the player at the tip-off from one team (say Team A) hits the ball out of bounds off the tip, without it touching any other player? Does possession go to Team B? Additionally, if possession does go to Team B, does Team B additionally start with ball possession in the second half (as if Team A had won the tip-off normally and subsequently turned it over on the first possession)?</p>

"What type of individual player incentives are allowed in the NFL?","<p>Recently, <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7638603/new-orleans-saints-defense-had-bounty-program-nfl-says"">ESPN (and others) reported</a> that the New Orleans Saints had instituted a ""bounty"" program. This program awarded players for inflicting game-ending injuries against the opposing teams and awarded different amounts of money depending on the type of injury. These types of individual player incentives are obviously deemed illegal by the NFL.</p>

<p>However, there have incentives written into player contracts regularly regarding total number of team wins, playoff wins, interception totals, sack totals, total number of yards rushing/passing or touchdown totals. As recently as March of 2012, San Francisco 49ers Linebacker Ahmad Brooks <a href=""http://wap.nfl.com/blogs/2012/03/01/brooks-sixyear-deal-with-49ers-heavy-with-incentives/"">signed a contract extension</a> that included incentives for wins and sacks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brooks has a base salary of $4.3 million in 2013 which is guaranteed for injury at the time he signed the deal. That becomes guaranteed for skill and cap if he’s on the roster April 1 of that year. However, the guaranteed portion can be reduced up to $2.5 million that year if he does not achieve certain sack totals.</p>
  
  <p>In 2014, Brooks has a base of $5.15 million, with $4.95 million becoming guaranteed for injury and skill if he is on the roster on April 1. However, that guaranteed total and base salary can be reduce by up to $2.5 million based on his 2013 sack production.</p>
  
  <p>Brooks can void all de-escalators in the contract if the 49ers win 12 games, he has 93.2 percent playing time that season and San Francisco plays in the conference championship game, or if he has two prior seasons of 12 sacks or more.</p>

"What are the main advantages of sit-on-top kayaks? What makes them so popular?","<p>I own a 5.18m Sea-Kayak. Obviously a sit-in type with a watertight spray skirt. It has two hatches which also close to not let water in, even if forcibly submerged.</p>

<p>On my trips to other countries (recently Lithuania, USA, Canada, Croatia) I am always offered sit-on-top kayaks. Sit-in type of kayaks are sometimes available but not always. Less so in purely recreational setups, such as calm, but touristy lakes. Rental shops advertise them as:</p>

<ul>
<li>being more fun</li>
<li>have holes to let the water out</li>
<li>are more stable</li>
<li>are faster</li>
</ul>

<p>As I see it, in fact they</p>

<ul>
<li>have holes which let water in from below (not suitable for cold weather/water)</li>
<li>are very sensitive to wind (hard on beginners, and for extended duration)</li>
<li>have very little ability to hold direction
(and are again thus more difficult to handle for beginners)</li>
<li>do not have storage capacity for tours</li>
</ul>

<p>So by my observation they are not good for beginners (hard to steer, wind sensitive), they are not good for experienced people (no hatches for storage, too slow, exposed to all elements). </p>

<p>Accordingly they would be especially bad for rental shops because those more often than not target beginners.</p>

"Does a fast paced NFL offense tire out the defense more than the offense?","<p>NFL broadcasts of Philadelphia Eagles games are full of shots of the opposing team's defense struggling to catch its breath. The announcers often discuss how Chip Kelly's fluid, no-huddle offense wears out the other team's defense due to its pace--even though the Eagle's time of possession tends to be lower than that of offenses of otherwise similar quality.</p>

<p>I don't understand why a no-huddle offense would wear out the defense more than the offense. If the defense can't make substitutions, then neither can the offense (right?). Announcers will sometimes mention the Eagle's training and conditioning,  but I assume that all NFL teams have rigorous training and conditioning.</p>

"How much faster/more useful is swimming under water?","<p>Underwater dolphin kicks are often considered ""the fastest way of swimming"".</p>

<p>Dave Berkoff introduced underwater swimming and won Olympic golds in 1988. Rules were changed and now only allow for 15 m underwater after start/turns.</p>

<p>Michael Phelps is considered a master of underwater swimming and his gold on 200 m freestyle in Beijing was, according to many, secured by his underwater kicks after the last turn.</p>

<p>It may appear like a simple relation. - Swim under water and gain time. But some facts make the relation complicated, I believe.</p>

<p>Many were impressed by Ryan Lochte swimming 50 m under water on 20.8 s at a clinic. It is fantastic but probably not very much faster than Lochte can do in regular freestyle. Swimming without breathing will also accumulate lactic acid.</p>

<p>Many say Michael Phelps achieved a considerable distance advantage by underwater work in one turn only (as described above). To get this advantage, the speed must be considerably higher  than Lochte had, recording 20.8/50 m.</p>

<p>And all swimmers do not make full use of the allowed 15 m swim under water. (Some say Phelps' large and supple feet make him more suited for underwater swim.)</p>

<p>So to me there are simple questions about this matter that have not been answered. Questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much faster is underwater swimming after a start/turn?</li>
<li>Why don't all swimmers make use of the maximally allowed 15 m under
water?</li>
<li>How useful is underwater swimming for competitive swimmers?</li>

"Quick free kick prevented by opponent","<p>I was recently playing football in a recreational league, when a teammate was fouled. The referee awarded us a direct free kick, and seeing that the opponents were choosing to argue with the referee instead of defending, I took the opportunity to take the free kick quickly.</p>

<p>I placed the ball in the correct position, and as I went to take it, an opponent moved and stood directly in front of the ball, making no effort to get back. I kicked the ball anyway, hoping it would go through his legs. Instead, the ball became caught between us and since it was in play, I began kicking at it trying to get it out.</p>

<p>The referee began yelling, asking me what I was doing, and then told me to wait for the whistle. At this point, all of their defenders were allowed to get back into position, marking all of our attackers and forming a wall in front of the ball. The referee then told me he didn't have to allow a retake, but he was ""doing me a favour"".</p>

<p>Was this handled correctly by the referee? As a supplementary question, if the referee is refusing to enforce the required distance correctly, what strategies can I use to avoid opponents preventing me from taking a quick free kick?</p>

I ask if it is smooth or is it like a <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/q/1584/1952"">surface of a golf ball</a>.</p>

<p>Water skis are supposed to run on water with very little friction. Is a smooth underside of the skis better than a surface with tiny dents or perhaps with low waves or what? It must have been studied which kind of surface glides with least friction on/in water. What kind of surface has the least friction?</p>

"NBA / MLB ball boy interference","<p>In the NBA, when the ball is in one end of the court, a ball boy usually squeegees the other end. In some cases the ball boy is caught off guard by a steal or an unexpected play and in some cases almost gets in the way of players. Although I have never seen it happen (I'm sure it has), what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player?</p>

<p>In the MLB, this same principle happens as well. When a player goes to the side of the field to try to catch a pop fly, sometimes they run into the ball boy. In the MLB, what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player?</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture below, this ball boy is interfering with play B.J. Upton.</p>

"When should the playing 11 be decided in a cricket match?","<p>I often see a thing in the cricket match broadcast, that the captains are on the pitch with a match official(commentator) and the toss would be done.

"Should you or shouldn't you wear two pair of socks?","<p><em>I skate in hockey skates, but for recreational purposes.</em></p>

<p>I am wondering if one should really wear two pair of socks? When I was buying skates, they guys in the shop adviced me to wear them, but now when I am suffering ugly lace bites I doubt the logic behind it:</p>

<ul>
<li>the skate feel is more puffy, because of all cushioning from all sides</li>
<li>the foot is placed higher</li>
<li>I cannot insert anything extra in front, because there is already very little room inside skate</li>
</ul>

<p>So maybe it is all wrong, and I should go with single pair of socks, get maximum fit from the skates, and forget about wearing anything extra because of the folk-tradition?</p>

<p>I am not looking for <strong>opinions</strong>, I am looking for hard <strong>reasons</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I also wonder to which extent it is common that same person represents a country at both world championships and universiade.</p>

<p>I have tried to Google for <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=universiade+olympic+medal+site%3awikipedia.org"">universiade olympic medal site:wikipedia.org</a> to see whether I find some people who won medals at both Universiade and Olympic games.

<p>My guess is that this is less common in the most popular (and best paid) sports such as football, ice-hockey, basketball. (I suppose that not many players would risk injury at a less prestigious event. I am also not sure about the collision of the dates with other competitions; professional teams probably would not be willing to let an important team member to leave their professional team for Universiade.) However, I do not have any data to support this guess.</p>

"Powder Problems Snowboarding","<p>This is a big issue that I am having when I am doing snowboarding runs on powder. Usually, when there is fresh powder from overnight or accumulation during the day, I tend to ""trip over"" and lose my balance over accumulated powder debris. What type of skills/drills can I do to make sure that this does not happen ? </p>

<p>I am able to do powder turns just fine in green level but when at times, It is really easy for me to pick up speed and lose control where I just trip over. When it gets to blue and black runs, I tend to really have this issue of tripping over since the snow is much deeper. While at really steep runs, I tend to do a turn (say toe turn) and while switching to my heel turn, I tend to traverse horizontally with my board and fall on my butt. Could someone provide some advice on how I can get better ?</p>

<p>I also tried to lean back but didnt exactly shift the bindings to the back (but could this really make that large of a difference) ? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
