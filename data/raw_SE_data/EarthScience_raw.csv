"Is there a special name for along-course elevation profiles of rivers, and where you can you find them?","<p>Was discussing the terrain and rivers of Europe today with my father and it became apparent that a graph of the elevation versus course of a river would offer interesting insight, including a quick summary into the elevation of various cities of interest along the course, and some loose feel for the possible speed of the river in various spots.</p>

<p>Are these along-course cross-sections made enough that there's a name for them?</p>

"Sulfate reduction","<p>I read a document in which the authors stated ""Sulfate and sulfide ( bisulfide and dihydrogen sulfide) both exist within a system just in varying proportions, and aqueous speciation is dependent on Eh/pH. If one side of the equation changes, the other will transform to balance it out"".</p>

<p>The system they are referring to is an engineered wetland, with low amounts of labile carbon but was amended with gypsum and therefore has high sulfate concentrations.</p>

<p>The authors have stated that in deeper zones of the wetland (5-10m), where it is fully saturated, and where oxygen penetration is minimal, aqueous bisulfide would be the main form of sulfur that exists. However, they have provided no evidence, and the carbon that exists in that zone is highly recalcitrant (meaning it is not readily degradable by sulfate reducing bacteria). So how can they say that the main form of sulfur is sulfide in this zone if the sulfate reduction process is not occurring, or very limited, due to low amounts of labile carbon? Even if it is not reacting with metals to form precipitates. </p>

<p>Isn't it common for sulfate to be main form of S even in anaerobic zones? The sulfate reduction process sure is usually carbon limited in high sulfate systems (e.g. marine sediments and even salt lakes). As far as I know, the Eh/pH tell you about the stability of the species, but it does not ""magically"" transform the sulfate to sulfide.</p>

"Relationship between pressure, temperature and density in meterology","<p>I have been learning meteorology a bit on my own, and one thing that never gets answered clearly is the relationship of pressure, temperature, and density.</p>

<p>When I looked it up, the density of air at various temperatures varies quite a bit - if I recall, from something like 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.  </p>

<p>My confusion comes from trying to understand weather formation.  A typical text says that, for instance, heating of the earth leads to thermals that rise due to their higher temperature <em>and lower density</em>, leading altitude increasing and to temperature dropping at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, then the moist adiabatic lapse rate, etc.  But it is always done using ""parcel"" arguments.</p>

<p>From basic thermodynamics, heating could lead to a combination of temperature increase, pressure increase, and physical expansion (if there is no fixed container).  </p>

<p>Specifically, the ideal gas law gives:</p>

<p>$$PV=nRT $$
or
$$P=\frac{n}{V}T$$ (ignoring the constant of R)
or
$$P=\rho T$$where $\rho$ equals density.</p>

<p>Am I wrong to assume that the simplifying assumption is that, to a first order approximation, the density can't really change much about an area since a parcel of air could expand, but the whole atmosphere locally can't (since the 'parcels' all abut)?  In other words, ground heating causes temperature to rise, and thus presumably pressure, but to a negligible degree decreases density?  </p>

<p>This would seem to imply higher pressure from heating actually leads to a net kinematic effect of driving the column of air upwards (as molecular pressure against the ground increases), where it can expand against lower pressure air above due to the fact pressure falls quickly with altitude - but there really isn't expansion or a decrease in density near the surface itself.</p>

<p>The typical ""parcel lifted by a helicopter"" argument fails to explain how it really all holds together and actually happens, since there is no 'container' for the gas in reality.</p>

<p>Another way to see this is in this example.  Suppose I have a hot tub in Antarctica in winter (I have one in Idaho in winter which is close enough).  The ambient temperature may be -30C or about 240K, and when I open the cover there is water at about 30C or 300K.  I can see thermals climb; the air, perhaps, is heated to 270K (being generous).  But the new air that gets sucked in and heated over the surface to 270K and then rises would immediately seem to be at higher pressure than ambient air since $$P=\rho T$$ I could even believe the kinematically more energetic air could cause an expanding 'plume' radially a bit as it rises, since the higher P and T slightly pushes out on less energetic ambient air.  But that just means $\Delta P$ is slighlty reduced to take into account the expanded volume of the plume; $\rho$ has dropped slightly, but nowhere near how fast it will drop if it gains altitude and has truly lower pressure about it.</p>

<p>In reality, it seems:</p>

<ol>
<li>locally the (synoptic) pressure is close to fixed - and varies only a few percent globally at sea level;</li>
<li>the gradient of pressure change is in the $z$ direction;</li>
<li>local heating increases T and thus P, except to the degree that increased P allows it to form an expanding plume (which is a few percent, so second order);</li>
<li>Really, the more energetic (kinetic) molecules have no where to go but up, what is really causing any updraft.  </li>
</ol>

"What are typical ranges of rainfall drop sizes, speeds, and areal or volume densities?","<p>I'd like to look into the possibility of using a Raspberry Pi and the PiCam module to detect rain, and to try to make some measurements of droplet size and rate. This could be done using an LED flash or a (modified/pulsed) laser pointer equipped with a fan-out element, synchronizing the flash/pulse with the Pi camera's electronic shutter for a ""freeze frame"" effect, followed by some Python image analysis (e.g. <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL/1.1.6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>PIL</code></a>).</p>

<p>This is for fun, and not meant to be a quantitative rain gauge necessarily.</p>

<p>In order to better estimate the challenge, I'd like to get some feel for the distribution of sizes, speeds, and either areal rates (drops per sec per square meter) or number densities (drops per cubic meter).

"Why isn't the date of final stratospheric warming and polar vortex breakup regared as the official end of winter?","<p>Let me try to clarify what I'm really asking: </p>

<p>Imagine that, for whatever reason, the meteorologists and Earth scientists decide to revisit the definitions of the seasons---to define them from scratch based on the current best science (kind of like what the astronomers were forced to do as far as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet"" rel=""nofollow"">the definition of a planet</a>). Based on our current best science, would it make sense to identify the winter/spring boundary as the date of final stratospheric warming? Or are there other considerations that are arguably more important---that arguably make more scientific sense as winter/spring demarcators?</p>

<p>My question is not about the history of the concept of the seasons, or about linguistics. I of course realize that the concept of final warming has been discovered only relatively recently, while the concept of the seasons has been around for millennia. I'm asking about <strong>scientific definitions</strong> here, which can and do change as science advances (e.g. Pluto used to be classified as a planet, and now it's not). </p>

<p>(Not that it matters for my question, but: if the science started saying that this is the new definition, the media would start reporting it, and eventually even the public at large would become aware of it. Speaking of which---and yes, sorry, this is off topic---but does anyone have any guesses as to why <em>don't</em> the major media outlets report on the date of the polar vortex breakup, regardless of the definition of the seasons? After all, the public is now quite aware of the polar vortex, given it has been blamed for so many cold spells recently.)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia article 'Sudden stratospheric warming',</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The radiative cycle in the stratosphere means that during winter the
  mean flow is westerly and during summer it is easterly (westward). A
  final warming occurs on this transition, so that the polar vortex
  winds change direction for the warming, however do not change back
  until the following winter. This is because the stratosphere has
  entered the summer easterly phase. It is final because another warming
  cannot occur over the summer, so it is the final warming of the
  current winter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, a <a href=""http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/warming_NH.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA-affiliated source</a> says that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final warming is the last stratospheric warming of the season.
  After this warming, the stratosphere never recovers to its previous
  state and the vortex breaks up and dissipates. The final warming often
  occurs in March or April. Sometimes the stratosphere never recovers
  from what would otherwise be a mid-winter major warming in January or
  February, and that warming becomes the final warming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand it, once the polar vortex breaks up, one cannot have sudden large temperature dips (like we are having in the northeastern part of the US <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/polar-vortex-is-visiting-nyc-this-weekend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this weekend of April 2-3, 2016</a>). Thus it would seem that the date of final warming is a good candidate for the official date of the end of ""meteorological winter"".</p>

<p>However, NOAA defines seasons according to calendar months (see <a href=""http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/meteorological-versus-astronomical-summer%E2%80%94what%E2%80%99s-difference"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). Meanwhile, the Swedes define the start of spring as ""when the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius on seven consecutive days"" (see <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/20090313/18200"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).</p>

<p>So: purely on the basis of current best science, would it make sense to define the end of winter as the date of the final warming? </p>

<p>Yes, one could not know that it happened until some time after it happened, but my understanding is that this lag is on the order of days, not weeks.</p>

<p>Yes, such a definition would have the consequence that some years, meteorological winter would end in January. But, so what? Some winters do seem to end in January... while the present one lasts into April.</p>

<p>Yes, one cannot define the demarcation between the spring and summer or summer and fall using the polar vortex as a reference. But, so what? There is no reason why each demarcation couldn't be a separate story. Even the fall/winter boundary need not necessarily be defined as the date of the formation of the polar vortex.</p>

<p>(And while we're at it--and I know this is off topic, but still---why don't the media report the date of the breakup of the polar vortex? It seems it would be of interest to people, given the notoriety the concept has received especially the last couple of winters... In fact, is the date reported anywhere?)</p>

Or, similarly, can, in the context of natural variability only, the climate suddenly switch to a very different state?</p>

<p>Most of the methods have been in continuous use since their inception, except one: kites were used, but later disbanded.</p>

<p>Why is this so?  <a href=""http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/kites_and_meterology.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This Monash university article from 1999</a> makes the point that they are superseded by radiosondes and aircraft.  However, atmospheric measurements on aircraft are very expensive and mainly used for research as opposed to operational weather forecasting; and, unlike weather kites, they do not (normally) fly in the boundary layer¹.  Radiosondes are only launched once or twice per 24 hours per location.  Passive (operational) space-borne measurements have a lower vertical resolution, in particular near the boundary layer.  I imagine that kites should provide a low-cost, high-resolution (both temporally and vertically) profile of the boundary layer.  Why is it they are not really used operationally anymore?</p>

"How have levels of outgoing longwave and incoming shortwave radiation changed over the last 20-30 years?","<p>So as we know, climate change is associated with increased radiation flux into the Earth. In other words, the sum of (incoming shortwave radiation) - (outgoing longwave radiation) [which I will call net flux] is greater than 0.</p>

<p>I'm just curious though - how have all of these fluxes changed over the last 20 years? Has net flux been constantly positive over the last 20-30 years? Is it changed by El Niño? Have we seen any changes in the flux associated with the recent ""slowdown"" in global warming?</p>

"How do I explain why the Tibetan plateau is colder than lowlands at similar latitudes?","<p>A common layman explanation for <em>why does it get colder to higher elevations</em> (considering only the troposphere here) qualitatively boils down to <em>The Sun heats the Earth's surface and the Earth's surface heats the atmosphere</em>.  I remember that, every time I heard or read this explanation as a child, I thought: then why is the Tibetan plateau still colder than lowlands at the same latitude?  After all, the solar energy reaching the surface in Tibet is no less.  Clearly there is more to it.</p>

"How will cloud feedback effects on the climate change as the result of global warming?","<p>So global warming will increase the tropospheric temperatures, which, in turn, would make the clouds higher than they otherwise would be.</p>

"How will climate change affect the entropy budget of the atmosphere?","<p>The entropy per unit mass of moist air can be defined as</p>

So I'm curious how the approach of other disciplines to stratigraphy differs from the archaeological. I'm especially interrested in geology - because it is the main and original discipline for stratigraphy, and because the geological time is very different from the archaeological time.</p>

"Sink holes in drainage area","<p>I live in Florida (<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/01/us/florida-sinkhole/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aka the land of sink holes</a>).  Due to the flat nature of my area, it is common place for housing developments (and any developments really) to dig large drainage areas to give water a place to go other than the newly constructed buildings.  In the case of my neighborhood that means that a large depression was dug to drain water from the land where all the surrounding houses were built.  The drainage area is roughly square, probably 50 meters by 50 meters in size, and about 4-5 feet deep (I'm pretty sure this is a common practice, even in less-flat areas).  In our case houses are built surrounding it in a big ""block"", and my house backs up to it.</p>

<p>It's covered in grass and well maintained, so I take my kids back there to run around semi-regularly.  We bought our house about 6 months ago, and about 3 months ago a large sink hole opened up in this drainage area.  Large in this case means that it is probably 2 meters deep at the deepest point and has an overall diameter of about 5 meters.  It's on the other side of the drainage area so it isn't right next to my house, but it's certainly not far.  We also recently found a second (and much smaller) hole - approximately 20 centimeters in diameter and 20 centimeters deep.  This small one is much closer to my back yard.</p>

<p>Of course I'm definitely interested in this sink hole as it pertains to my house (aka does this imply that this area may be prone to sink holes), but I'm also curious about these things generally.  To keep it to a simple question, I'm wondering if this is a sink hole that opened up like all other sink holes in Florida - aka a collapsed underground hole/cave that just <em>happened</em> to miss all the surrounding houses?  Or is it possible that this is a local affect, aka something about these drainage areas can lead to sink hole formation, implying no immediate concern to the surrounding houses?  I realize this is probably not an answerable question for my specific sink hole, but I thought people here might have some insight into whether or not drainage areas might cause their own sink holes.</p>

<p>In case it isn't clear, this drainage area has no drain point itself.  During heavy rain, water flows into the drainage area and then slowly evaporates or percolates into the ground.  In case it matters, when it does rain, water typically collects on the opposite side of the drainage area than the side which contains the sink hole. I.e. the sinkhole is on the ""high"" side of the drainage area (although the elevation difference probably isn't more than a dozen centimeters).</p>

"Measuring Transect Length on Sea Floor","<p>I was wondering if anybody had any insight or thoughts on a technological bottleneck we are facing in data collection. </p>

<p>Basically, we have vessels (single operator) dig the substrate for collection purposes in water depths generally shallower then 35' (maximum of 35' but average about 15') via bullrake (large clam rake with a telescopic handle). The digger stands aboard a vessel with the rake and is drifting along by current/wind, thus completing a ""transect"" after a period of time based on how quickly the vessel is drifting. Transects typically range from 5-50m in length. Currently we are measuring the length of the transect (which is define as the point at which the rake first begins digging along the bottom until the point digging ceases on the bottom) via GPS fixes at the start and end of each transect.</p>

<p>At it's best, this induces inherent inaccuracy in transect length relying on GPS (although GPS accuracy is at least recorded at each fix). I was wondering if anybody here could think of a solution to record transect length more reliably or a workaround to equate transect length more accurately? Is there a piece of equipment which could be affixed to the rake to measure its distance traveled?</p>

<p>Proper solutions must be able to be operated by a single person while aboard a vessel and be straightforward and quick enough to rival (preferably beat out right) the time it takes to allow for a proper GPS fix and manual recording of coordinates. </p>

"Weather conditions to create significant glacier growth","<p>I am fascinated at the rapid growth of Glacier Bay Glacier from 1600 to 1750, along with its rapid retreat from 1750 to 1900.

How much colder was the average local temperature to create no retreat during the summer peak heat during the growth period.</p>

How different and noticeably different would the climate have felt by citizen of near by Juneau if living during the rapid growth period of 1650. Was it harsh winter conditions almost year round, or ? How much did the average day time high change from what it is today. Can an <em>average</em> year round change in temperature of .5C or 2.5 or 4.5 degrees cause this huge change in glacier behaviour.

Those conditions would imply that the last Ice Age will happen 1-4 billion years from now. A better estimate would be awesome.

"Why does Earth have abundant oxygen in the atmosphere?","<p>Because of photosynthesis, obviously.  But then it's not actually that obvious after all, because photosynthesis is mostly balanced by respiration. </p>

<p>We can summarise the processes of photosynthesis and respiration like this:
$$\begin{align}
\ce{CO2 + H2O + h\nu} &amp; \rightarrow \ce{O2 + CH2O(biomass)} \\
\ce{O2 + CH2O(biomass)} &amp; \rightarrow \ce{CO2 + H2O}
\end{align}
$$
If these two reactions were always balanced then the concentration of $\ce{O2}$ would never have changed. If I understand correctly, there are abiotic processes that deplete $\ce{O2}$ to form iron oxides, and so in order for there to be persistent $\ce{O2}$ in the Earth's atmosphere, the biosphere as a whole must continually produce an excess of it. In order for this to happen, there must be some processes that consume biomass at a non-neglible rate without removing a corresponding amount of $\ce{O2}$ from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>My question is, what are the processes primarily responsible for this? Is it just due to the burial of unoxidised organic matter (to form coal, oil, etc.), or is there more to it than that?</p>

<p>If they are different processes, I'm interested both in what caused the excess of oxygen during the ""great oxidation"" event, and what maintains the excess of oxygen on the modern Earth.</p>

"Is a controlled fractional crystallization process feasible on the Moon?","<p>I am looking for a way to separate metal oxides on the Moon. Please bear with me - it's for an ultra-hard science fiction project. Processes typical on Earth are not effective there. Heat is cheap on the Moon, there is strong constant sun that is easily concentrated. Heat also dissipates slowly thanks to the vacuum, and reflective insulation can be used to slow heat loss much more. </p>

<p>So, I wondered if a form of controlled fractional crystallization could be used to get pure olivine from a molten melt of rock, and then the olivine could be split into forsterite and fayalite the same way. The forsterite might make decent clear glass, or if not, the fayalite can be processed with hydrogen to get iron, water, and silica, and the silica can be used to make glass. It might be necessary to apply centrifugal force to get the crystals to separate in the Moon's low gravity. If the technique works, it would seem the same process could be used to isolate other metal oxides through other paths.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and carbon atoms are present on the level of around 100 ppm. Am I correct in thinking that mineral separation would occur this way and could be controlled to get good purity? I know there are engineering issues, but in terms of the geochemistry, is it correct that crystallization and settling would occur in this way?</p>

"Did climate cool down when underground hydrocarbons stocks formed?","<p>As far as I understand, the dominant theory of modern climate change says that recent warming is mainly caused by the massive burning of hydrocarbons that used to be stored in solid form mostly underground as petroleum, coal, etc.</p>

<p>I am envisioning a large container with many cubic metres of gas, probably thermally isolated longitudinally and with a radiative IR input at one end (<em>A</em>) plus measuring apparatus at the other end (<em>B</em>) and some distributed thermistors throughout. We know the thermal input at <em>A</em>, measure the thermal output at the <em>B</em> and measure the trapped thermal energy via the thermistors. </p>

<p>I would like to get a result with something like +/- 1% accuracy. Would this be possible? Assume I have a budget of at least $10,000,000.</p>

"Is the ocean guaranteed to warm in a warming climate, regardless of whether it absorbs LW radiation?","<p>More specifically, I've seen some discussion of this article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/09/why-greenhouse-gases-heat-the-ocean/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/09/why-greenhouse-gases-heat-the-ocean/</a></p>

<p>which claims that the observed ocean warming is explained by the ocean skin absorbing long-wavelength radiation. What I am asking is: is this mechanism necessary for ocean warming to occur? My naive understanding was that our increasing the magnitude of the greenhouse effect meant that there was less radiation escapting to space, and therefore the average temperature of the entire ocean+earth+atmosphere system will increase until it reaches a new equilibrium, where outgoing radiation again equals incoming. Is this correct? And if it is, does it not imply that the ocean must also get warmer, simply because it is a thermally coupled part of the entire warming system? I had someone tell me that the a warming atmosphere could not warm the ocean beyond an infinitesimal amount, because the atmosphere has a much lower heat capacity. But it seems to me that the constraint on the final equibilibrium temperature means that all components must warm, no matter how inefficient the means of energy transfer between them - as long as there is some means for energy transfer, increasing the overall temperature must increase each of the components. Am I right, or have I misunderstood?</p>

"How large can local surface CO2 concentration vary due to natural processes?","<p>I'd like to have a rough idea of how large local surface CO2 concentration vary due to natural processes.</p>

<p><strong>For example, a purely hypothetical experiment:</strong></p>

<p>If I set up some CO2 monitors in a wide variety of locations around the globe (e.g. mid-ocean, jungle, desert, plains, tundra, mountaintop, beach...), say at 2 meters off the ground, and took some measures to avoid close proximity to substantial anthropogenic CO2 sources (industrial, transportation, population, farms) and fires or episodic geological sources (e.g. <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/10145/#comment19754_10145"">volcanos or magma pockets under lakes</a> per @jamesqf), roughly speaking what might the variation look like? </p>

<p>A starting guess might be that they'd all be nearly featureless, around 400ppm, with only say +/- 10 or 20 ppm daily and yearly oscillations. Of course there is a whole lot of important science within those variations, but for the purposes of this question, I'd call those variations small.</p>

<p>Would my detector in a forest or jungle see higher peaks, or deeper troughs than one in a desert, or mid-ocean? What might the biggest excursions be? Might it ever reach down to 300 or up to 500 ppm <em>due to natural processes</em>?</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that while I tried to so some searches, it is very popular to show data from urban and suburban locations, where peaks of 500 or 600 ppm or even higher are seen that are attributed to wind direction and concentrated man-made sources, and that variation is not what I'm after. Here is just one example (<a href=""https://weather.usu.edu/htm/file39359/24-hour-co2-concentration"" rel=""noreferrer"">48 hours</a> and <a href=""http://weather.usu.edu/htm/co2-concentration"" rel=""noreferrer"">yearly</a>) but there are many much larger studies published with sensors in urban areas.</p>

"ppmV versus μmol/mol for atmospheric CO2 - how to convert?","<p>For a uniform mixture of ideal gases, I think that the concentration of a gas reported in parts per million by volume (ppmV) and micro-moles per mole (μmol/mol) would be the same.</p>

<p>When I see atmospheric CO2 discussed, I have seen both units used, depending on the source. See for example, the comments under <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/10152/6031"">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Since multi-atomic gases like N2, O2, H2O and CO2 are not ideal gases (even monatomic gases are not absolutely ideal) I would guess that for realistic atmospheric samples at different altitudes and times, the CO2 concentrations expressed in ppmV and μmol/mol would not be numerically identical. Further, due to the variations in concentrations of the other constituents they wouldn't even be strictly proportional.</p>

<p>Is there a handy, approximate conversion constant, or function, that is more accurate than unity? Is there a  nearly-exact one?</p>

"Which physical parameters can we actually measure to confirm the existence of the Greenhouse Effect (GHE)?","<p>The theory of a GHE in a planetary atmosphere is rather well known. Many claim it is no longer a theory but actually proven as a fact.</p>

<p>However I have been reading a lot of things Richard Feynman said about science and have decided to apply some of them to the GHE. I am going to start from an assumption this is something new I have just come across and after listening to the explanations ask: ""How do we know it is like that, what can we measure or test to confirm it?""</p>

<p>Now Richard Feynman had a very useful piece of lab equipment which he used quite a lot. I've got one of them too, albeit a version with a lower spec and with a rusty outer casing that shows its age. However I have tested it recently and it is up to spec and passes its boot up self-test. You might have a higher spec one.</p>

<p>So please apply your brain to this:</p>

<p><strong>Planetary Atmosphere Thought Experiment.</strong></p>

<p>You have 2 identical planets, same mass, same rotational speed, same orbit around a sun. They have gaseous atmospheres of identical heat capacity and of the same height. The orbits are perfectly circular and regular. The planets have reached a thermal equilibrium. The ONLY difference between the 2 planets is that one has greenhouse gases in its atmosphere and the other does not.</p>

<p>What differences would the GHE make to the conditions on the 2 planets?</p>

<p>Well fairly obviously if there is a GHE on one its surface temperature will be higher. We will call the planet with the GHE planet G, and the one without planet N.</p>

<p>G will have a higher surface temperature. Now suppose we are looking from outside, from space, at G and N. Will they look different to any measuring apparatus? We know the solar input to each is the same (orbits are the same) so, as we know G and N are in thermal equilibrium it MUST be the case that quantity of radiation leaving the planets is the same. So if we measure it like we do for any celestial body we will measure the same ""effective temperature"" looking at G and N.</p>

<p>G and N will have the same effective temperature. The surface of planet G will be hotter than N. The height of the atmospheres is the same so the temperature gradient in the atmosphere will be higher on G. Its lapse rate is higher. For any given height in the atmosphere the temperature of the atmosphere on G is higher at that height, than the temperature on N.</p>

<p>So G has a higher surface temperature and the temperature of its atmosphere is higher. Yet, as both planets are radiating into space at the same rate their measured effective temperatures are identical.</p>

<p>This then leads to my main question;
What physical parameter can we measure if given ONE planet, without any knowledge of what the conditions are on the other, in order to determine whether we have been given planet G or N?</p>

<p>EDIT 22/4/17.
I am adding this edit as the answers attempted so far have all really been an explanation of the details of how the GHE works on Earth and the specifics of CO2. I would like the question properly addressed as it is in connection with the thought experiment proposed. The answer I am looking for will likely be given in general terms, applicable to the GHE from any greenhouse gas or a combination of 2 or more and also be one generally applicable to any planet you might find anywhere. Multiple parameters may be measured. You do have access to the planet's surface or any chosen point in the atmosphere. To clarify the gaseous atmospher may be any combination of gases or a single gas, the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere is the same on each planet, the height of the atmospheres is defined as the height of the troposphere so the tropospheres are the same height. Layers of atmosphere above the troposphere can vary between the 2 planets as I believe there is no claim or evidence that the presence or absence of a greenhouse gas in these upper layers is significant (if you have knowledge otherwise please state it).</p>

<p>EDIT 26/4/17 . This edit follows the question being put ""on hold"" as being too broad. The actual question posed is quite specific and narrow and is also  brief and to the point. It is the ""What physical parameter(s) can we measure ?"" type of question. That is not broad at all, it is specific and it follows the format of what Richard Feynman suggests.
The answer is expected to be in the form of ""We would measure X"" or ""We would measure X and Y"" or ""We would measure X, Y and Z"". Obviously the answer could be expanded via something like ""We would measure X and if it is below n then that shows..."".
So based on a simple and specific questions, and the expected simple answers, the claim of those who put this on hold for being too broad looks erroneous and I suggest they revise their view as it does not accord with a logical examination of the situation as I have explained.   </p>

"Experimental testing to falsify the theory of the greenhouse gas effect","<p>Irrespective of how accepted any scientific theory happens to be it is often worth thinking about a possible experiment to test said theory and perhaps falsify it. If we wanted to do this for the theory of the greenhouse gas effect what areas are worth considering when designing such an experiment? Would we limit ourselves to just the radiative heat response of CO2 or are their wider issues we need to incorporate into the experiment?</p>

<p>This question is NOT a duplicate as it relates to the generality of greenhouse gases and specifically asks IF we should limit ourselves to the radiative response of CO2. Therefore one possible avenue of answering could be to consider the wider issues of water vapour and methane and such an answer would be clearly outside the scope of the CO2 specific question which has been postulated as the duplicate. </p>

"Why is March colder than September in Northern Hemisphere?","<p>Forgive my ignorance of the subject but I was always wondered about the exact reason of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Vernal equinox happens around March 20, whereas autumnal equinox happens around September 22, so wherever you are in Northern Hemisphere, the length of the day, and consequently the amount of solar energy that reaches the place should be almost the same. </p>

<p>However the average temperatures differ widely, for example Toronto has average temperatures of 2°C to 6°C on March 20th, and 14°C to 19°C on September 22nd. So around 12°C difference <a href=""https://weatherspark.com/averages/28179/3/20/Toronto-Ontario-Canada"">[link]</a>.</p>

<p>So obviously there is some sort of temperature inertia, as temperatures seem to experience a delay in responding to changes in day length.</p>

<p>What is the main reason for it? Is it effect of sea ice or snow-covered land albedo? Energy stored in oceans? Energy absorbed by melting snow and ice?</p>

"How to interpret hourly precipitation forecast?","<p>How should I interpret the hourly precipitation forecasts? </p>

<p>Most of the time, when there is rain in the forecast, the maximum Probability of Precipitation (PoP) in the hourly forecast is about the same as the daily PoP. </p>

  <p>Ingersoll mentioned the final Grand Finale observation he was looking forward to most at the very end of our conversation, which could solve an ongoing mystery of the planet’s formation. Saturn’s magnetic field has a very unusual property in that it’s “axisymmetric”—it has no tilt. That’s weird, because the math behind planetary magnetic fields requires a bit of tilt.</p>

"Why doesn't the 71% water of the earth dry or evaporate?","<p>Perhaps a simple question, we know 71% of the earth's surface contains water as oceans. If Earth's age is 4.543 billion years, then I guess it should be decreased with drying or should have been dried so far. Why doesn't it dry or decrease?</p>

<p>If we put some water in sunlight, it evaporates. The oceans are the chief source of rain, but lakes and rivers also contribute to it. The sun's heat evaporates the water.</p>

"Why is the part of the earth tilted towards the sun warmer? Which factors matter more?","<p>The part of the earth tilted towards the sun is warmer. For example, in the Northern hemisphere, the earth is tilted towards the sun in the months around June and tilted away from it in the months around December. </p>

<ul>
<li>This has the effect of increasing the exposure of the earth to the sun for the latitudes tilted towards the sun. </li>
<li>Also, the more tropical the latitude, the more energy is received per unit area.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two ideas are illustrated by the figure below:</p>

<p>There are other effects, too...</p>

<ul>
<li>If the sun's energy must pass through more atmosphere, there is greater opportunity for it to scatter into space before reaching the earth</li>
<li>When the sun strikes the earth, if it strikes it obliquely there is greater chance for the light to be reflected rather than absorbed.</li>
<li>Finally, whether the sun strikes water or land or ice has an effect, because each has a different degree of absorption and reflectivity. </li>
</ul>

<p>In total there seem to be 5 different major factors in how much energy is absorbed by the earth from the sun.</p>

<p>My question is what is the relative importance of each of these factors? Is there a set of equations or measurements that describe the total energy received by the sun in terms of these 5 different factors?</p>

"Modified blackbody model of earth. What is wrong with it?","<p>I have made a modified blackbody model that predict earth temperature distribution with high accuracy. It doesn´t include mass or gases. It is based on the initial thought that all energy above surface is solar heat, and heat transfer must apply to the system. Just some simple modification to the perfect blackbody surprisingly enough gave very accurate results. </p>

<p>I answered a question with these equations, but a moderator deleted it for unknown reasons. It is only numbers, and no speculation, so I really can´t understand why. </p>

<p>The greenhouse effect uses The Stefan-Boltzmann equation to add fluxes, stacking them, and that is not allowed in thermal physics. It is a balance equation and should only be used for ""net"" transfer. </p>

<p>I show why it is wrong to use an average value of solar irradiation over the whole surface area, it is because intensity is instantaneous. You cannot use average, because that means that the sun would only be ~5C. Or -18C depending on what solar average you use. Solar heat is about 105Celsius at TOA, that makes a big difference. I show how surface temperature and atmosphere temperature distribution is connected to the solar constant all the way. </p>

<p>It is not shown here, but the model also show direct and total irradiation at zenith, with accuracy. Anyway, since it was deleted without explanation, I get the feeling of censorship, since it falsifies the greenhouse effect. Now I ask you. What is wrong with it?: </p>

<p>I use Stefan-Boltzmann equation and temperature. Solar heat is absorbed according to the geometric difference between the blackbody and earth, two volumes with shells.</p>

<p>$TSI/(4/3^2)$.</p>

<p>And since only half the surface area is irradiated, </p>

<p>$(1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)=383W/m^2$</p>

<p>or 286.7 Kelvin. The effective temperature is found by heat transfer to the surface and inverse square law,</p>

<p>$1/4∗(TSI−((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)))=244W/m^2$, or 256 Kelvin.</p>

<p>Tropopause temperature:</p>

<p>$((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2))−(1/4∗(TSI−((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)))=138W/m^2$ </p>

<p>or 222 Kelvin. As you can see, heat dominates everything, and just modifying the blackbody to observed differences, absorption in depth of a volume + irradiation of only half the surface, gives a accurate distribution of temperature.</p>

<p>The numbers are, from my POV, unquestionable. Such a good fit falsifies the greenhouse immediately, especially since no experiments show the effect where cold gas can increase the intensity of the heat source heating it, which the theory claims. So, what are your opinions?</p>

"When GCMs are calibrated do they use 'corrected rainfall' input?","<p>Part of calibrating Global Climatic Models involves 'hindcasts' or 'history matching' against historic climate records, including rainfall. Such rainfall records are all in error because almost all raingauges incur at least a 7% aerodynamic under-catch. Conventionally this is not 'corrected' but for model calibration they should be corrected. So are GCM using corrected or uncorrected rainfall inputs? If yes, how are the rainfall records corrected - just multiplying by 1.07, or some other way? If no, why not? This is important because, worldwide, the GCM outputs are being used for forward projections of water resources (even though that is not what GCMs are designed to support).   </p>

<p>My question is: given an old (compared to the half-life of $\ce{^{14}C}$, more than 100 million years old let's say), sample of coal with for example 2% nitrogen and 80% carbon, how much carbon-14 would be present due to the neutron flux underground?</p>

<p>Obviously this is going to be at least 1000 times less than in modern plant materials. But what order of magnitude would be expected?</p>

<p>In case it helps, I'll add these references:</p>

"Can human activity affect volcanoes?","<p>As part of a course on Natural Disasters, I have a group presentation in which we focus on a specific natural disaster. One of the questions we have to address is how human activity may have affected the geographic area and/or the disaster. The topic for our group is volcanoes, with a specific focus on the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. So my question is — is this possible?</p>

<p>The closest I can think of is human-induced seismic activity, due to fracking or wastewater injection, for example. However, I do not know if this could conceivably also affect in any way nearby volcanism. I also don't think there are or have been any oil-related activities around Mount St. Helens, but I really don't know for sure. So, is this possible?</p>

"Is it possible that a reduction in vegetation is a cause of global warming?","<p>A lot of people seem to believe that the entire cause of global warming is that humans are emitting lots of carbon dioxide. However, according to a source I found online (I accept it may not be entirely trustworthy) roughly 46% of trees on the planet have been destroyed since the dawn of the human race, we cut down 15 billion trees every year! Another source I found says that 16 trees absorb the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> the average active person emits every day (an active person emits roughly 1kg of CO<sub>2</sub> every day). This means we have destroyed enough trees that we no longer can support 937.5 million people! It also means that those trees are no longer taking in 937.5 million kg of CO<sub>2</sub> . Here's a line chart showing deforestation from 1800 to 2010. The deforestation rate has gone up.</p>

"Why doesn't the earth become superheated?","<p>One day I was sitting in an Atlanta traffic jam wondering about all the engine exhaust heat warming the localised environment. Later that night, things will have cooled down. Where did the heat go?  On a global scale, I understand our sun heats the earth via radiation, not conduction as  the intervening vacuum of space cannot transfer heat. So if the sun has been beaming gazillions of watts of energy into the earth over the last few billion years, and energy is conserved and the earth does not radiate out daily a material proportion of the radiation it has absorbed, where has all that energy gone?</p>

"What are the major contributors to the amount of infra-red emitted by the earth?","<p>From the answers from an earlier question, I learned that most of the solar radiation gained by the earth system (atmosphere, surface, and inner mass) is re-radiated back into space in the form of infra-red. This balance of incoming solar radiation and outgoing infra-red radiation depends on the earth system's infra-red radiation 'equation' - that is, how it takes 'in' the various forms of solar radiation and converts them into infra-red. At least, that's the best I can make out of this article <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page4.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earth's Energy Budget</a> and this accompanying chart.</p>

<p>My question is what are the principal components of this 'equation'? I imagine the percentage of water in the atmosphere and on the surface of the earth, the mean absorptive ability of the non-water surfaces of the earth, and, what is most mysterious to me, what is the 'factor' of infra-red production by different surface materials. I imagine this is all highly technical and finely detailed in large elaborate models, but are there 'big levers' that represent most of the infra-red radiative effect? Where I am 'headed with' this, of course, is if there is a practical way to increase this radiation back to space that can make a positive difference on global warming (ie net positive radiation into space after accounting for increased greenhouse gases back radiation)? And I imagine there is not, given we are not trying that.</p>

"Do Tectonic Plates Merge?","<p>I had a question concerning the nature of continental plates.</p>

<p>When looking at the Eurasian Plate today, for the most part, there is one solid fragment of the Earth's crust. However, having had a look at maps detailing prehistoric Earth, this isn't always the case. Throughout the entire Phanerozoic Eon, Eurasia has been a collection of different landmasses gradually merging together. Baltica, Kazakhstania, all the various regions of East and South-East Asia. Yet, today, only India and Arabia are still situated upon separate plates. All others no longer possess any divisions between them.</p>

<p>Why is this the case? I was under the assumption that it was only oceanic plates that submerge into the mantle due their density. I though that when continental plates collide, neither continent submerges, forming mountains. Shouldn't there still be distinct tectonic plates?</p>

<li><p>And others argue it is <strong>Sairecabur volcano</strong> in Chile/Bolivia, because it is the highest point at the latitude which is closest to the Sun on January 5th, when the perihelion happens (i.e. the point in Earth's orbit that is closest to the sun) (<a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-place-on-Earth-closest-to-the-Sun"" rel=""noreferrer"">example</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>A fifth answer, with the same logic as the previous, is <strong>Licancabur volcano</strong> in Chile/Bolivia, which quite as close to the latitude of the perihelion but is significantly higher than Sairecabur.</p></li>

"Is the effect of Earths position relative to sun large or small compared to CO2 level in climate change?","<p>A recent answer by Camilo Rada for <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/16000/what-place-on-earth-is-closest-to-the-sun"">""<em>What place on Earth is closest to the Sun?</em>""</a> inspires this question. He makes clear that significant changes in the wander of the earth through its orbit results in striking effects on how close the closest distance is between these two bodies.  In the same thread others point out the height of solar flares relative the the baseline surface of the boiling hydrogen ball are likely even larger effects.  It is intuitive to me that the distance to the main producer of heat on the Earth SHOULD be a much larger effect than concentration of a gas in our atmosphere.  Is this a reasonable intuition?</p>

<p>So my questions has four parts:</p>

<p>1) Generally, do the big dog scientists modeling for climate change in the next 100 years take these apparently very large effects into account in their models and how big of an effect is this compared to CO2 ppm levels?  It would be nice to have an answer in some sort of statistical level of confidence.</p>

<p>2) Another way to consider this is how big of an effect is this variable compared to the expected CAUSES of CO2 ppm levels: combustion on earth of various kinds, respiration and farting of living species, chemical processes, etc</p>

<p>3) Can the sun's energy level, solar flare activity be modeled and used to predict, in the absence of CO2 ppm level changes, the temperature on earth in the future 5 years.?</p>

<p>4) As Mr. Rada points out in the referenced thread is this distance changed on such a limited <em>timeline</em> as to make it NOT as relevant or a lot smaller effect than it first seems?</p>

"Why do loose, soft soils amplify earthquake vibrations rather than dampening them?","<p>Areas where the buildings are built on top of a deep layer of loose sediments are widely recognised as being more prone to earthquake damage (all else being equal) than areas where the bedrock is shallow and building foundations can easily be dug down to it, because the loose sediment cover amplifies the vibrations from earthquakes, increasing the amount of damage they cause.  Why is this?  Intuitively, one would expect that, since the vibrations from an earthquake originate in the bedrock or deeper, buildings bolted directly to bedrock would be the worst-affected, and having a thick sediment layer would dampen the vibrations considerably.</p>

<p>So why do soft sediments amplify earthquake vibrations, when one would expect the opposite effect?</p>

"Nonlinear Stokes equations for glacier modeling","<p>What is the difference between </p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$\operatorname{div}(-\mu(u)(\nabla u\color{red}{+(\nabla u)^\mathsf{T}})+pI)=f\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>from the physical point of view, in the glacier modeling context?</p>

<p><strong>Does it make sense to model a glacier with the first one?</strong></p>

<p>To explain the notation, $u$ and $p$ denote the velocity and pressure fields, respectively; $\mu(u)$ denotes a velocity-dependent viscosity coefficient (for example, Glen's power flow law). The gradient of $u$ is</p>

<p>$$\nabla u=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\dfrac{\partial u_1}{\partial x}&amp;\dfrac{\partial u_1}{\partial y}\\ \dfrac{\partial u_2}{\partial x}&amp;\dfrac{\partial u_2}{\partial y}\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>and $(\nabla u)^\mathsf{T}$ denotes the transpose matrix of $\nabla u$. (If $u$ has 3 variables its gradient is analogous to the 2-variable case). Frequently, $f$ is $f=(0,0,-\rho g)$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration constant and $\rho$ the ice density. $I$ denotes the identity matrix and $div$ the divergence of a matrix is the divergence by rows, for example,</p>

<p>$$\operatorname{div}\left(\begin{array}{cc}w_1&amp;w_2\\ s_1&amp; s_2\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\dfrac{\partial w_1}{\partial x}+\dfrac{\partial w_2}{\partial y}\\ \dfrac{\partial s_1}{\partial x}+\dfrac{\partial s_2}{\partial y}\end{array}\right).$$</p>

<p>This way, we may rewrote (1) and (2), respectively, as follows:</p>

<p>$$-\operatorname{div}(\mu(u)\nabla u)+\nabla p=f$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$-\operatorname{div}(\mu(u)(\nabla u\color{red}{+(\nabla u)^\mathsf{T}})+\nabla p=f$$</p>

"Can I use diamonds as fossil fuel?","<p>Aside from cultural implications (correct me if I'm wrong but artificial diamonds are not so hard to obtain, right?) diamonds are pure carbon and are more unstable than graphite. So, why not use diamonds as fuel?</p>

<p>My approach: steel melts at 1500°C at least (and there are better steel that melt at higher temperatures). It is pretty high compared with diamond combustion temperature that is just 800°C and once you get to that point combustion will generate enough energy to burn diamond itself. So you can burn it in a steel piston.</p>

<p>Ok, I admit 800°C is pretty high compared with paper and wood (233–400°C) but it is a clean combustion (you obtain only CO<sub>2</sub>, assuming a constant oxygen input). From this point of view hydrogen is the only competitor but it rise to 500°C, that is not little.</p>

"How to tell if fog is made out of water droplets or ice crystals?","<p>I understand that clouds can be made out of water droplets and/or ice crystals. And that fog is nothing else than low-lying clouds.</p>

<p>However, I've experienced fog in a wide ranges of temperatures. I like mountaineering and you often get fog high in the mountains. I've been lucky enough to visit the high mountains of Antarctica and I've also experienced fog there at very low temperatures.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/5383/11908"">answer</a> (in the comments) and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog"" rel=""noreferrer"">fog wikipedia article</a> mention that ice fog happens only at extremely low temperatures (-35 or -40 C). But I think I've experienced fog at those temperatures too. Some times, with the right light I've seen the air filled with tiny crystals, but I wouldn't call that fog, because it is very thin.</p>

<p>Then, as far as I can tell, all thick fogs feel and look the same. No matter if they are made out of ice crystals or water droplets. <strong>Is that right?</strong> <strong>Or is there a way to differentiate between ice/water fogs?</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe contrary to what I think, I've never experienced frozen fog.<br />
But: would I notice the difference if I were to ever experience it? How would they feel/look different?</p>

(I should really be grateful they got images at all, as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXn5LTKWn9Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this low image quality video</a> provides some idea of the difficulty of reaching the location, which requires crawling through at least eight feet of one-foot-high passage and lots of three-foot-high passage, and the ceiling directly above it is about two feet high, so I can't complain about the quality!)</p>

<p>I saw it with my own eyes. Cleopatra's grave is an oblong feature on the floor of Catacombs Cave (lava tube) about three feet long and two feet wide and rimmed by apparently normal cave floor that raises up about an inch or so above the surrounding floor. Cleopatra's grave is composed of rock of a light grey color as opposed to the dark grey and slightly brown-tinged floor around it. It looks very smooth (I didn't touch it because of its historic paint) and it exhibits circular fractures running two complete rings around its outer edge. It is trivially identified by the rather recent red paint serving to mark the locations of the historic yellow paint applied by J.D. Howard himself calling it by name.</p>

<p>The surface has no visible crystals, and if I didn't know it was natural I'd have thought on seeing it that somebody had mixed up some really fine grout (think cement) and poured it. Furthermore, the surface exhibits no specular reflection and almost perfectly uniform matte reflection.</p>

<p>But what is it? Some kind of lava upwelling? A rafted block of unusual shape? Something else?</p>

<p>This is a locally-well-known feature that I'm hoping somebody here actually knows the answer to. But there is simply not another way of getting at it -- there's no way I'm going to test its hardness or otherwise risk damage to so much as the paint on it.</p>

"Crystallography: The shape of axial divergent profiles","<p>I don't know if crystallography related topics go into this stack exchange, so sorry if that's wrong here.</p>

<p>My question concerns the characteristic shape of axial divergent powder patterns. According to Dinnerbier and Billinge, <em>Powder Diffraction Theory and Practice</em>, RSC Publishing, <strong>2008</strong> can an axially divergent reflection be decomposed into various positions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tuQQd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tuQQd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here <em>φ1</em> marks the most divergent part of the incoming X-rays. What I can't find however is how this shape is related to the divergence itself. So why does it look like this 'fin' with a strong fronting-effect once the beam diverges? My idea would be the following. As the diffraction on the sample creates a scattering-cone where the circular base holds the information on the intensity we will only see some part of it, a conic section where the cone itersects with the detector slit. So the overall and still arbitrary intensity (y-axis, not area under the curve) should be the arc segment the slit actually detects. But if I move the detector slit (that is orthogonal to the cone's direction) parallel to this direction, so I intersect at a point closer or further away from the scattered sample I should expect the overall intensity in this arc segment to be smaller once it is further away as the same intensity should be spread over a larger circular path and therefore a segment has comparably lower intensity the further it is away from the source. That is at least how I would imagine it to happen.
So if some parts of the incoming beam scatter further away from the scattering center, so axial divergence happens the cone should travel a longer distance compared to the central part of the incoming X-rays (focus point). So if it intersects with the detector the main non-divergent part of the beam will have a smaller cone and higher intensity density than the divergent one. If both have a rather similar conic intersection (leaving curvature for a second) it should have a relatively lower intensity for the more divergent part of the beam.</p>

<p>Is that reasoning somewhat logical or am I completely wrong here?</p>

"Would oceans regenerate if removed?","<p>On Earth, there is enough Hydrogen and Oxygen to make 13,88 million km<span class=""math-container"">$^3$</span> of water (calculation below). However, oceans contain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth"" rel=""noreferrer"">only a tenth of that</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, most of the hydrogen must be stored in other chemical compounds different to water. Or, as water deep within Earth's interior: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/13/earth-may-have-underground-ocean-three-times-that-on-surface"" rel=""noreferrer"">some studies suggest the water on Earth's interior could contain three times as much as the water near the surface</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are many chemical reactions, like the well known <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"" rel=""noreferrer"">photosynthesis</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"" rel=""noreferrer"">respiration</a>, that can transform water into other compounds and vice versa.</p>

<p>We often think that there is a fixed amount of liquid water on Earth (plus or minus what is being recycled in the atmosphere). But it seems to me that the processes above could change the water amount significantly over geological timescales.</p>

<p>So my question could be stated as follows: <strong>over geological timescales, what determines the amount of liquid water on Earth?</strong></p>

<p>Here are two examples of the processes I'm thinking about:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir transfers</strong>: If water from a well is removed, the ground water reservoir around it will slowly re-fill the well. Would the same happen with Earth's oceans if removed? Would water from the deep Earth's interior partially re-fill the oceans through volcanic eruptions?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chemical balance</strong>: For a chemical reaction that can go both ways, if the reactants and products are in equilibrium and I remove the product compounds, more of them will be generated until a new equilibrium is reached. Would the same happen if I remove the water from Earth's surface? Will Hydrogen and Oxygen from rocks and air combine to partially replenish the oceans?</p></li>

<p>But I am confused by this question, what exactly is its steady state? what exactly is the reservoir size and what it the inflow and outflow?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>EDIT: Problem-solved with the help of Camilo Rada. The way you calculate residence time is by using the formula:</p>

<p>$\text{Residence time} = \frac{\text{Reservoir size}}{\text{in-flow or outflow rate}}$</p>

<p>In the example I looked at the box in the diagram for atmosphere's content of residence, being $3 \times 10^{20}$ units, that will serve as our total reservoir size, then we can either choose the outgoing or incoming flow (as an approximation as the reservoir is not in steady state), I chose the outgoing, so we add them together: $7 \times 10^{12} + 7 \times 10^{12} = 14 \times 10^{12}$ units per year. Now plug that into the formula:</p>

<p>$RT_{ATMO} = \frac{3 \times 10^{20}}{14 \times 10^{12}} = 21,428,571 \, \text{years} = \, \backsim 21 \, \text{million years}$</p>

<p>It would be the same process for each box.</p>

"How vertically deep do lava conduits go?","<p>I'll preface this with the truth and hope it doesn't disqualify the question but rather give context: after reading Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne, I am amazed at the prospect of venturing into volcanic conduits to explore the interior of the Earth. <strong>How deep do lava conduits go, why don't they go deeper, and what kinds of formations or environments exist at their terminus?</strong></p>

<p>I am not new to Earth science but am pretty new to in-depth geology (pun intended) and volcanology. From what I can tell, the type of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_cave"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lava cave</a> which goes the deepest is referred to as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lava tube</a>. Apparently these tubes can be fairly long (e.g. a tube from Mauna Loa goes 50km before terminating[?] at the ocean!) but not very deep (Wikipedia on lava tubes lists a mere 15m!) Why do these tubes not go far deeper?</p>

<p>The deepest conduit from surface to inner Earth is apparently the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kola Superdeep Borehole</a> which terminates at ~12km deep upon reaching higher-than-expected temperatures. I think of magma - liquefied hot rock erupting out of volcanoes - as coming from even deeper than that depth. Therefore, why doesn't lava tubes or other volcanic conduit continue to such deep depths? Do they, but it is too difficult to explore? Do they during eruptions, but soon after cool and fill with solidified rock or eventually collapse and thereby fill with rock?</p>

<p>As noted I'm new but interested to the subject, so any info to help me understand the processes and environment involved in this interface between inner Earth and the surface would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, what about the feedback loop between temperature and soil organic matter? As temperature increases so does soil organic matter, as soil organic matter increases so does the release of CO<sub>2</sub> thus causing more warming. A positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>An earlier question <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/q/12075/6031"">What is likely to have happened with these newly discovered antarctic volcanos below the ice?</a> shows sub-surface radar measurements of antarctic ice, in this case to a depth of 1.5 kilometers, and therefore with a total path length of 3 kilometers in ice.</p>

<p>The water molecule is strongly polar and interacts with microwave radiation by absorbing and thermalizing it. This effect is obvious in microwave ovens. Microwave ovens can be used to ""defrost"" frozen food even a few centimeters thick, using reduced power and longer time. This is necessary because frozen water molecules have a lower absorption than those in unfrozen areas, but they are still quite absorbing.</p>

<p>Radar measurements travel through kilometers in ice round trip, substantially larger than the thickness of a slab of frozen peas.</p>

<p>How is ice-penetrating radar able to work through such long path lengths of ice? Is there a special frequency thats used, or other tricks allowing for extremely weak reflections after bulk attenuation to be detected and measured?</p>

I understand the basic hierarchy of it (HUC4, 6, 8, 12) and watersheds/drainage areas. Here's what I want to clarify:</p>

<p>A group of HUC8s can be within a single HUC6, because each HUC8 ultimately drains to the pour point of their parent HUC6. <strong>What separates one HUC8 from another HUC8 downstream of it, both within the same parent Hydrologic Unit?</strong> I suspect the answer isn't the natural drainage area, because <em>the downstream HUC8 would contain the upstream HUC8 in its natural drainage area</em> - that's based on me thinking that as you shift the discharge point you're examining further downstream, the drainage area you're examining increases.</p>

<p>The most concise, relevant explanation I've come across is from <a href=""https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/Supplemental/Watershed.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">the USEPA's EnviroAtlas Data Fact Sheet on the subject</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A
  watershed  is 
  defined  as  the
  geographic  a
  rea  within  the 
  boundary
  of   a   drainage   divide.   Watershed   boundaries 
  follow  the  highest  ridgeline  around  the  stream 
  drainage 
  area; 
  the  bottom 
  of  the  watershed  or  the  pour  point  is  the
  lowest point of the land 
  area 
  where water flows out of the 
  watershed.
  Hydrologic   unit   boundaries   do   not   always 
  surround    a    complete    watershed    but    may    delineate 
  truncated portions of a larger watershed
  —
  for example, the 
  mid-stem   of   a   larger
  stream   or   river   along   with   the 
  tributaries
  in  that  area. 
  Hydrologic  units  are 
  generally 
  synonymous   with   watersheds   when   their   boundaries 
  include  all  the  source  area  contributing  surface  water  to
  a 
  single   defined   outlet   point.   This   distinction   between 
  watersheds and HUCs is important in the context of water 
  resources   data   analysis   and   water   quality   monitoring, 
  because  the  area  contributing  to  the  downstream  outlet 
  point in a single HUC may extend beyond its boundaries in 
  an  upstream  direction  to  include  a  number  of  other  sub-basin HUCs.</p>

That brings me back to my question in bold above - any guidance or clarification on finding paired USGS stream gauges and HUC's <em>that are drainage areas</em> (since not all hydrologic units represent actual watersheds that can be gauged)?</p>

"How does the interaction between Subtropical Westerly Jet Stream and Himalayas causes subsidence of air?","<p>While reading the topic ""Monsoon"" in Aguado's Understanding Weather and Climate, I read this line </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During winters... Air flows down the southern slope of the Himalayan
  Mountains due to more rapid cooling over land than over
  the Indian Ocean. This flow is enhanced by a portion of the
  jet stream flowing along the southern flank of the mountain
  range. Interactions between the jet stream and mountains
  cause convergence in the upper troposphere, which leads to
  sinking air that gets forced southward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is talking about the Subtropical Westerly Jet Stream's southern branch flowing along the southern Himalayas, but how does it cause convergence in upper troposphere? And how the convergence in upper troposphere leads to sinking of air?</p>

<p>In the same topic, after few lines, while explaining the situation in summer season it is mentioned that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The situation changes abruptly during late spring or early
  summer....Aloft is
  an easterly jet stream, with often divergent motion promoting
  uplift.</p>

<p>Why this Easterly jet stream has divergent motion, how it differs from the SubTropical Westerly Jet Stream in this characteristic? And again the same question, how does divergent motion in upper troposphere cause uplift? </p>

<p>Since I couldn't find anything useful related to Jet Streams and convergence/divergence it would be helpful if someone could provide exact mechanism. </p>

<p>The above link describes the coefficients used to define the ECMWF model levels in pressure in order to compute geopotential height. Is there a similar data for NCEP reanalysis model or is the data already on pressure levels in which case the above step is not required ? To be precise I am looking for the identical data for the T62 NCEP reanalysis data(2.5 x 2.5).
The NCEP reanalysis model uses the sigma vertical coordinate. The same question can be rephrased in the following manner</p>

<p>1) What are the values of the sigma levels and where can they be downloaded?
For e.g. if the sigma level is 0.995 and the surface pressure is 1000 hPa then the pressure at the sigma level 0.995 is 995 hPa.</p>

<p>2) Are the sigma levels of the NCEP reanalysis model comparable to the a and b coefficients of the ECMWF model ?</p>

<p>The hybrid vertical coordinate of UCAR <a href=""http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/usersguide/node25.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Community Atmosphere Model(CAM 3.0)</a> describes a similar equation to that of ECMWF and has explicit coefficients A and B as shown below</p>

<p>$p(\eta,p_s) = A(\eta)p_0 + B(\eta)p_s$</p>

<p>where p is pressure, $p_s$ is surface pressure, $p_0$ is a specified constant reference pressure and A and B are coefficients that specify the coordinate being used and are defined only at the discrete model levels. </p>

"Waves on sandy beach separating differently-sized rocks?","<p>I recently went to a beach, and I noticed that the sand seemed to have a few distinct regions.  I'm wondering what would cause this, and how it works.</p>

<p>One region is the part of the beach which is kept wet by the waves, but is far enough away that most waves don't seem to reach all the way to the end of it.  This part consisted of small-grained, ""soft"" sand.</p>

<p>This region is followed by a region with a lot of small rocks (mostly the size of, say, someone's smallest toe).  This region was located a bit past (i.e.: further into the water) the lowest point the water tended to reach.  This size of the grains of sand of this region blends smoothly into the previous region, so they get progressively larger as you walk further out to the water.</p>

<p>The last region is another one of fine-grain sand, and it also had ripples in it (I'm assuming that this is just because of the waves, because I noticed that the waves picked up sand from the peaks of the ripples and pulled it back out to sea).</p>

<p>The first two distinct regions seem to be the result of some type of sorting mechanism induced by the wave.  If so, how does this work?</p>

<p>And why was there a second region of fine-grain sand <em>after</em> the coarse-grain region?</p>

"Timeline of Himalayas/Tibetan plateau formation","<p>Note: edited based on helpful comments.</p>

<p>In <em>Walking with Cavemen</em>, Robert Winston claims an African rainforest existed 8 mya, but by 4 mya it was gone. He attributes this to newly Himalayas-triggered Indian monsoons, which prevented rainfall from reaching Africa. However, it's my understanding that India collided with the rest of Asia circa 50 mya. So why did the monsoons take so long?</p>

<p>Multiple comments have noted that Winston should have credited the monsoons to the Tibetan plateau. Either way my assumption is that, until the mountains had been pushed up far enough, they didn't threaten the forest's rain supply. On a linear approximation, by 8 mya the Himalayas' mean height would be approximately 85% of its present value, which bounds the ""critical value"" of the altitude as a percentage of its current one. A similar calculation applies for the Tibetan case.</p>

<p>I won't reproduce the full question here. I'm asking about the discussion in the following paper about flat ice plates of order 100 microns in size at about 5,000 to 8,000 meters in altitude in thin clouds over land. Specifically the idea that areas that are tens of kilometers wide could contain plates that are all coplanar - parallel to the local Earth's surface and more importantly to each other, to within about 0.1 degrees.</p>

<p>While here is part of the discussion section of the paper, further explanation of the geometry of the satellite and Sun are in the <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/q/21587/12102"">linked question</a>.</p>

<p>The discussion section of the very recent, on-line-available <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073248/epdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point</a> Alexander Marshak, Tamás Várnai and Alexander Kostinski, doi: 10.1002/2017GL073248 contains the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on in-situ measurements of cirrus clouds, [Korolev et al., 2000; McFarquhar et al., 2002], tiny hexagonal platelets of ice, floating in air in nearly perfect horizontal alignment, are likely responsible for the glints observed by EPIC over land.  Because the EPIC instrument has a field of view of 0.62 degrees (see, <a href=""https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic</a>) and a 2048x2048 pixels CCD, the specular signal within an angle of only $~3x10^{-4}$ degree (Fig. 2) must either contain smooth large oriented ice plates or smaller oriented platelets sending back diffracted light. Size distribution of such crystals depends greatly on cloud temperature and humidity but the range is from tens of microns to mm. Taking the wavelength of 0.5 micron and ice platelet size of 50 microns, yields the ratio or angular half-width of the diffraction lobe around the specular direction $10^{-2}$ or on the order of a degree [Crawford, 1968, p.486].  This is broader than the angular width of a pixel but narrower than change in the zenith direction over the area covered by a pixel (0.1°).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is this collective horizontal alignment a known effect at even 1 degree, much less 0.1 degrees? Has this ever been measured to be true over such large areas, or even calculated? </p>

<p>Although the result is preliminary and the discussion short, the authors suggest that this uniform horizontal alignment would not be an unusual occurrence at all. For example, later in the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of total 4106 images collected, 336 contain land-glint for the blue channel, which was chosen because it has the highest spatial resolution (to reduce the amount of data transmitted from DSCOVR, for all other channels four pixels are averaged onboard the spacecraft). Can one interpret this ratio 336/4106 = 8.2%? To exclude images with ocean at the location of possible glint, we divide the 8.2% by the land fraction in EPIC tropical band (1/4), yielding 32.8%. Hence, roughly one in three images with land in the center contains a glint from an ice cloud. This matches the fraction of Earth covered by ice clouds in tropics which is also about a third [King et al., 2013]. This agreement suggests that terrestrial glints seen from deep space supply efficient means of detecting cloud ice, reflecting at least a factor of 5-6 stronger that surrounding pixels and may substantially increase cloud albedo [Takano and Liou, 1989], relative to diffuse reflectance from randomly oriented ice particles. This is significant as cirrus clouds, composed mostly of aspherical particles, cover over 30% of the Earth surface and play a major role in the radiation budget [Stephens et al., 1990]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm interested if there are there any explanations for <em>why</em> this might happen. I know there is a phenomenon called a ""<a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sun_pillars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun pillar</a>"" that involves reflection off of such ice plates in the atmosphere, and I don't quite understand how the pillar is tall vertically but not wide laterally, but that is perhaps a different question.

"A faster way to measure the rock magnetic S-ratio?","<p>The <em>S</em>-ratio is commonly used in rock magnetic and enviromagnetic studies to quantify the relative abundances of minerals with high and low remanent coercivities. As most frequently defined (e.g. by Evans and Heller, 2003), it is calculated as −IRM<sub>−300mT</sub> / SIRM, where SIRM is the saturation remanence magnetization, and IRM<sub>−300mT</sub> is the remaining magnetization after applying a 300mT reverse field to a saturated sample. In my experience, the usual procedure for determining the <em>S</em>-ratio on a discrete sample is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apply a saturating field with a pulse magnetizer (or, at least, apply the strongest field possible with the equipment).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the saturation magnetization in a magnetometer.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the 300mT reverse field with the pulse magnetizer.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the new magnetization in the magnetometer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On a large set of samples, things can be made quicker by working in batches and using an automated sample handling system, but it's still necessary to make two trips to the pulse magnetizer and two trips to the magnetometer. It struck me recently that, with a cryomagnetometer capable of measuring all three axes of magnetization simultaneously, a faster and more convenient procedure should be possible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apply the saturating field along (say) the x axis of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the 300mT field along an orthogonal axis -- the y axis, say.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the total magnetization vector in a 3-axis magnetometer.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the SIRM as the sum of the magnetizations along the x and y axes, and IRM<sub>−300mT</sub> as the magnetization along the y axis.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, a similar (but far more involved) technique is already commonly applied: the triaxial IRM and thermal demagnetization protocol of Lowrie (1990), which involves applying decreasing IRMs along three orthogonal axes. In Lowrie's technique, however, there is no mention of calculating the SIRM as the sum of the orthogonal components.</p>

<p>Is anyone already using this technique? Are there any obvious pitfalls I've missed? I am tempted to try it the next time I need to determine an <em>S</em>-ratio, after a pilot study to confirm that the SIRMs are additive in the way I assume.</p>

"Using sodium chloride load as a point source pollutant variable in SWAT model?","<p>I'm currently working with the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). My task is to model the loading of sodium chloride into streams.   </p>

<p>One approach I would like to take is to use the point source rechour.dat file command. The file can contain several variables regarding pollutant load.<br>
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ORGPHR</code> is the organic P loading kg/hr,</li>
<li><code>NO3HR</code> is NO<sub>3</sub> loading kg/hr,</li>
<li><code>DISOXHR</code> is O<sub>2</sub> loading kg/hr,</li>
<li>etc...   </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But interestingly enough there is no NaCl loading variable!</strong> </p>

<p>Am I able to customize a new variable explicitly NaCl, or will I have to use <code>CMTl1HR</code> which is a heavy metal loading kg/hr?</p>

<p>I was also thinking I could customize a soil type with high salinity. </p>

"Can the process of subduction flatten the shape of a subducting plate relative to the plate it's going under?","<p>There's something I’m still not quite getting about why island arcs are arcs. In the examples I’ve seen, the subducting plate is compared to a knife slicing across the surface of an orange - but it makes sense for the slice of the orange to be an arc, because the knife is a flat plane while the orange is a sphere.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3X3bHXEXfU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3X3bHXEXfU</a></p>

<p>Subducting plates, on the other hand, are parts of a spheroid ""slicing into"" another part of the same spheroid. I’m assuming that because subducting plates are part of the Earth’s crust, they must also be curved, unlike the knife. </p>

<p>So it seems that if the knife is creating an arc <em>because</em> it's flat relative to the shape of the orange, something must flatten the subducting plate so that it's flatter relative to the plate it subducts under. <strong>Does the <em>compressing force</em> of the upper plate on the subducting plate flatten it relative to the shape of the upper plate?</strong></p>

"How sustainable is timber housing?","<p>Recently I watch a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqGH1_tAjlU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> on which they made a pretty impressively large building complex for housing out of timber. And they were saying that timber is sustainable compared to concrete and such.  From the outset this seems pretty straight forward, trees grow back so long you don't do anything terrible to the ground the grow on (like salt it or build a shopping mall), and concretes components (ie. the stones and calcium oxide. the water does evaporate) does not. However thinking a little harder I know that plants need phosphorous to grow, and currently there is a <a href=""http://theconversation.com/how-the-great-phosphorus-shortage-could-leave-us-all-hungry-54432"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shortage of of phosphorous</a>. <strong>If we are using tress to build our skyscrapers, wouldn't they be locking away our supply of phosphorous for our food and the world's ecosystem?

"Godfrey's island rule (stream function in multiply connected domains)","<p>In <a href=""https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-15-0046.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> paper, the authors detail the methods to calculate the stream function $\psi$ from velocity data in the case of the global ocean (i.e., multiply connected domains).</p>

<p>The general idea is to use velocity to calculate the vorticity $\zeta$ and, with that, calculate the stream function by solving the Poisson equation:
$$\nabla^2\psi=\zeta$$
The difficulty of the problem is to specify the boundary conditions. As we do not want a flow across the boundary, we require $\psi=\mu_k$ on all the coastlines, with the value of $\mu_k$ being a constant to be determined for each different coastline (i.e., each island/continent).</p>

<p>To do this one can use the so-called Godfrey's islands rule that follows from requiring that the circulation around each island should be constant.
At the end of the day, one should solve a system of equations that relate the $\mu_k$ and the derivatives of $\psi$ normal to the coastlines (eq. 19 in the paper):</p>

<p>$$\sum_k\mu_k\int_{\partial I_k}\partial_n\psi_j~ds+\int_{\partial I_k}\partial_n\psi_0~ds=\int_{\partial I_k}\mathbf{m}\cdot ds$$</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>Shouldn't the normal derivative be zero in order to have no-flow?</p>

<p>If yes, probably not, but if yes, this would imply that all the $\mu_k$ would be zero and one could avoid to solve the system altogether...</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<hr>

<p>Side questions:</p>

<p>1- How can one calculate the normal derivative with numerical data when the coastline is ""segmented"" and the normal vector not well defined? For example in this case:</p>

<pre><code>   ____
__|xxxx|___
xxxxxxxxxxx

<p>2- Does anyone know of a freely-available code for solving this problem? I am currently struggling with the normal derivatives...</p>

"Winter in the Northern Hemisphere in July? Can anyone explain it?","<p>The July 2007 issue of the National Geographic Magazine dedicates several pages to <strong>""Climate Change""</strong> and <strong>""Global Warming""</strong>.

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>""Earth slowly wobbles like a top as it spins on its axis, which shifts back and forth about every 20,000 years. The result: <strong>About 11,000 years from now, winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere will be in July.</strong></li>

<p>Although I know exactly what a top is, and how it spins, I find it hard to understand how wobbling is expected to bring about that forecast.</p>

<ol>
<li>Can anyone explain more didatically how such a shift is expected to happen? How the wobble movement is doing it?</li>
<li>Is such an astronomic phenomenon accepted by scientists unquestionably?</li>
<li>If winter is expected to be in July 11,000 years from now and such a shift is under way right now, does it mean that winter in the NH is slowly moving towards July and that, perhaps, 5,000 years from now winter solstice will be in March? </li>

"Help identify glowing stone with scarab carving","<p>I found almost no information from searching Google, Someone mentioned it might be Fluorite. I simply don't know where else to look for an answer and so I am asking you.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my parents traveled with me to Egypt and there, they bought me a little scarab beetle carved of some stone, about 5 cm long, 2 cm width and height. The stone is whitish and translucent and glows green in the dark (for some time). I only remember that it might (just a speculation) have been in Luxor in an Alabaster workshop. But, according to online sources, Alabaster is not supposed to glow in dark, so what is it then? Can you please tell me?</p>

<p>The phosphorescence [nb, earlier version said 'fluorescent'] is really weak and doesn't last longer than 5-10 min so I am sorry for a bad photo, just couldn't make it better.</p>

"Haean, South Korea: is it of volcanic or meteor impact origin?","<p>This is a layman's question.

"Before the Great Oxygenation Event, where was the oxygen?","<p>Today, the oxygen in the atmosphere is about 10<sup>18</sup> kg.
The estimated carbon biomass of the earth is about 4×10<sup>15</sup>. Less than 0.5%.</p>

<p>Estimated fossil fuels are around 5 times as much as existing carbon biomass. If these estimates are appropriate, then probably before the oxygen was released it was not locked up in carbon compounds.</p>

<p>Oxygen could have been extracted from inorganic stuff and cycled through the biomass. </p>

<p>Which reduced minerals were left behind? Not silicates and carbonates. Little magnetite crystals? </p>

<p>Maybe there was more SiO<sub>4</sub> before (things like olivine), and living things tended to produce silicates with less oxygen (things like kaolin)? There isn't a whole lot of silica dissolved in seawater at any one time, but there's a whole lot of silica available and it could add up eventually. Silicates with more oxygen weathered away, and silicates with less oxygen were deposited?</p>

<p>Maybe there's so much free oxygen <em>today</em> because some H<sub>2</sub> got produced, and it rose right out of the atmosphere and got swept away. So there's less water and more oxygen than there used to be.</p>

<p>Maybe the biomass estimates, and the fossil fuel estimates, don't actually tell us about the carbon, and there is lots of reduced carbon elsewhere.</p>

<p>I'm speculating, does anybody have good answers?</p>

"Is there an approximate rate for water temperature by depth that could be modeled simply?","<p>I know that there are a couple of questions covering latitude and longitude for water temperature, but overall I'm more interested in the rate of temperature change by depth.</p>

<p>Thought Process: Baseline geothermal gradient is defined as the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the Earth's interior, and approximated at about 25–30 °C/km (72-87 °F/mi) of depth near the surface in most of the world. That's maybe, what, approx. 1°F/75 ft, barring circumstance and variables unknown.</p>

"Which percentage of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions are human made emissions?","<p>I was watching a science/myth Youtube channel (science mixed with a lot of speculative/fantasy content) with 2M+ followers and the Youtuber said volcano made emissions were higher than human made emissions. Now, I thought this was wrong and apparently some figures I saw in articles showed this was wrong, but then, I found this article</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.skepticalscience.com/human-co2-smaller-than-natural-emissions.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Skeptical - Human CO<sub>2</sub> smaller than natural emissions</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> is tiny compared to the 750
  gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because
  the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this article seems to be stating than in general natural emissions (not only volcano emissions) are indeed higher than human made emissions but human made emission are really bad anyway because they can't be absorbed and break the natural balance. </p>

<p>So now I really don't know if they are higher or lower. Then my question is , which percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are human made emissions? and how volcano only natural emissions compare with human made emissions?</p>

"How to determine (lost) surface (km²) of a country when both population and population density have changed?","<p>I am not sure if the question suits in this stack board, but I give it a try.</p>

The population sunk to <strong>100 million people</strong> and <strong>10 inhabitants per km²</strong> (still assuming that surface was given to victors, thus the country now has a smaller surface!!).

"What would be a reasonable set of thresholds for flood severity classes?","<p>When working with extreme hydro-meteorological events, flood in particular, it is common procedure to classify each event by its return <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_period"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">period/recurrence interval</a>. This probabilistic measure has the quality to provide a standard and homogeneous measure of the different events that eventually happened in diverse geographical areas, given their relative frequency.

"Why are pyroclastic flows ground-bound?","<p>This bugged me for a while:</p>

<p>Pyroclastic flows are fast (up to 700 km/h (430 mph) according to Wikipedia) and typically roll down the slopes of a volcano. E.g. here <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvjwt9nnwXY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvjwt9nnwXY</a>.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder, <strong>why do those hot gasses not ascend up into the atmosphere?</strong> This is what hot air does, so there must be something very special about theses gasses.</p>

"Signatures of acid rain at KT boundary","<p>I read in Walter Alvarez' book T. Rex and the Crater of Doom
that the Earth's collision with the large meteor leading to the K-T extinction catalyzed the reaction of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen molecules to form nitric oxide, which in turn formed highly corrosive nitric acid when combined with water. In addition the impact is thought to have volatilized huge amounts of sulfur contained in anhydrite, which in turn formed sulfuric acid.</p>

<p><a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/2760/are-there-any-metal-anomalies-other-than-iridium-in-the-k-pg-boundary?rq=1"">This</a> question refers to a thickness of  <span class=""math-container"">$\pu{1.8m}$</span> for the section where iridium could be detected in the K-T boundary, suggesting that the resolution may be too low to note the effects of acid rain following the collision. </p>

"Why does a subduction zone produce a serpentinization diapir rather than volcanism?","<p>The classic Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus has been uplifted by a 'serpentinization event'. Upper mantle (peridotite) has been serpentinized creating a buoyant diapir. This has uplifted the ocean crust sufficiently for it to be thrust over continental crust (underlying continental crust has been inferred from gravitational surveys).</p>

<p>The last sentence of the abstract of <a href=""http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/88/12/1763"">""Tertiary uplift history of the Troodos massif, Cyprus"", AHF Robertson</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dominant driving force may have involved the liberation of water
  from a subduction zone dipping northward beneath Cyprus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes sense - serpentinization is the alteration process of olivine -> serpentine in the presence of water. And, as we know, subduction slabs release fluids (primarily water) into the overlying mantle wedge.</p>

<p>These fluids usually promote partial melting leading to andesite arc volcanism. However, Cyprus has this big serpentinite diapir instead of volcanism. Why?</p>

<p>What causes the fluids from the subducting slab to occasionally result in serpentinization of the mantle wedge instead of partial melting?</p>

"Why does phosphate rock contain uranium?","<p>I have been doing some research on the issue of phosphogypsum pollution.

"Climate on an Earth without an Axial Tilt","<p><strong>The Premise</strong></p>

<p>The Earth rotates on its own axis, which is tilted by about 23 degrees. I am imagining a situation where such an axial tilt does not exist. </p>

<p>From general reading, it appears the largest impact of removing an axial tilt would be on seasonal change, in the sense that there wouldn't be any changes whatsoever. Every latitudinal belt would have its own set season all year round, with some minimal changes depending on the earth's distance from the sun in its usual orbit (ranging basically from 91.4 million miles in January compared to 91.5 million miles in July - which is less than 1%).</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>What would be the implication on rain cycles if the Earth had no Axial Tilt? It appears to me that rain carrying clouds move to the dictates of wind blowing to an area with a different air pressure. If our planet had no axial tilt, the Equator would get extremely hot all year round, causing water to evaporate and move north or south towards cooler areas - at least that's my understanding. </p>

<p>2- MSLP over mountains seems to be a strong function of temperature (since it varies a lot over night and morning)</p>

<p>1) Are these two previous statement correct?</p>

<p>2) Can I normalize MSLP in terms of elevation?</p>

<p>To get more insight at what I am trying to figure out: I am trying to interpolate observational MSLP data; however, since MSLP is very high on mountains I am getting wrong results around those points. In other words my algorithm would assume that a large area around the station that is on top of a mountain has an MSLP of 1020 while in fact, just as you move away few kilometers MSLP changes very quickly to 1010 because of the elevation drop, so how can I fix that?</p>

<p>The BBC news article <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39728714"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rare 'sprites' photographed beside Southern Lights</a> shows photographs by the Australian photographer David Finlay. They are remarkably clear and distinct, and set against a clear night sky filled with stars. (The two fuzzy blue blobs are the large and small <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds"" rel=""noreferrer"">Magellanic Clouds</a> - dwarf galaxies in the local group.)</p>

<p>I had thought that sprites were challenging to photograph not only because they are dim and rare requiring a special low-light cooled-CCD camera and luck, but that one had to be almost directly above a thunderstorm. This is a view of an almost completely clear sky, from the ground with a normal camera.</p>

<p>Are the clouds and light in the distance at the bottom of the first image the source of these sprites? There is really that much difference in altitude between the sprite and the associated thunderstorm?</p>

"Can ice caps reform if they disappear?","<p>Excuse my ignorance. I'm under the impression that there are various types of ice at the poles, but I don't know the difference or the significance of each type, so, in terms of whatever is actually melting in these areas as a result of climate change, is it possible that it could come back if greenhouse gas emissions were eliminated or something like that? Basically, I'm assuming that the ice caps are necessary in order to maintain the habitability of the planet for humans, so is there some sort of threshold of melting that would essentially count as a point of no return or is there always the possibility of seeing the ice caps return to safe levels?</p>

"How are scatterometer observations standardised before being fed into reanalysis models?","<p>This very basic question occurred to me during a talk on reanalysis data sets. Often we know the observations produced by a particular instrument, say rain radar, are biased from one year to the next because of changes in how the instrument has been calibrated, or because methodologies for processing the raw data it produces have changed. </p>

<p>How is this dealt with in long reanalysis data sets like ERA-Interim? Are the observational data sets made as consistent as possible before being fed into the reanalyses model, or are biases somehow smoothed out through complex data-assimilation methods or something along those lines?    </p>

<p>EDIT: To provide a specific example, how are scatterometer data sets incorporated into ERA-Interim when we know there are biases between them (for example <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4160-4"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wu and Chen (2015)</a>)?  </p>

"Are there datasets like the global land-ocean temperature index for land surface temperature only?","<p>I have no background in climate science, but I've become interested in explanations of the so-called ""global warming hiatus"" from 1998-2013. One explanation that people seem to think is convincing comes from <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Karl et al</a> who, if I understand correctly, say that the apparent hiatus could actually be an artifact of changes the way we calculate sea-surface temperature -- specifically that during that period we moved from primarily boat-based temperature measurements to primarily buoy and Argo float measurements. Since boat measurements are systematically a bit warmer than buoy measurements, the gradual switchover looks like a slight cooling trend when in fact it's just a difference in measurement technique.</p>

<p>I wanted to assess this argument for myself as well as I could, so I thought, if Karl et al are correct, then we shouldn't see evidence of hiatus in land-based datasets then, right? So I went in search of a dataset like <a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA's global land-ocean temperature index</a> but constrained to land only. I have found some very granular LST datasets (like <a href=""https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD_LSTN_CLIM_M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>), but I don't think I've got the expertise I'd need to turn them into a yearly global timeseries (e.g. should I just take a straight mean of all the datapoints? Should I be weighing by landmass or seasonality, etc?).</p>

<p>So my question is, does a high-level aggregated yearly mean LST dataset exist? If not, why not? And at a higher level, does my approach to investigating the Karl et al work make sense, and if so has someone who knows what they're doing already done it?</p>

"What is the ""global mean surface temperature change estimate"" an estimate of?","<p>NASA publishes what it calls an ""estimate"" of the Earth's global mean surface temperature. Digging through papers I've been able to find some documentation of how these numbers are computed, but I have had a frustratingly hard time answering what seems to me a much more basic question: what is this ""estimate"" an estimate <em>of</em>? That is, what is the abstract conceptual quantity that we'd really like to know, if we could? Without that, I don't understand how we can evaluate how well, for instance, the methods they use to blend together data sources of different resolutions and reliabilities, since the definition wouldn't have any stronger ""correctness"" criterion than just ""this is how we put these numbers together"".</p>

<p>It seems to me that the conceptual quantity they're trying to measure is, for a given year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imagine gridding up the earth into equal-area grids and putting a thermometer in each one.</li>
<li>For each thermometer, imagine taking the limit of the average reading as number of readings increases for a one-year timespan from midnight on Jan 1 to just before midnight on Dec 31 of the given year</li>
<li>Now take the limit of the average of all those single-thermometer limits for every thermometer in your grid, as the size of the grid squares decreases.</li>
</ul>

<p>But this is really just a guess as to what they're after -- I have skimmed over several papers on this subject and I haven't been able to find any discussion of this at all. Is this just something basic that climate researchers know that I'm missing?</p>

"Rayleigh waves generation","<p>Good day,</p>

<p>I do not fully understand the physical mechanism of formation of Rayleigh waves at the free surface. While their derivation is quite clear and obey free-boundary conditions, it is not clear their physical mechanism.</p>

<p>Could you please correct me in my discussion. Incident P-wave can transform to reflected P and SV waves. When the angle of incidence of P wave reaches 2nd critical angle, both outgoing P and SV waves propagate along the surface forming Rayleigh wave. So, P-wave by itself can form Rayleigh wave. At the same time, incident SV wave can transform to reflected P and SV waves. When the angle of incidence of SV wave (again) reaches second critical angle - both outgoing P and SV waves propagate along the surface forming Rayleigh wave.</p>

<p>Can then Rayleigh wave be formed by interference of both incident P and SV waves on the free surface or Rayleigh waves are formed only separately by incident P or SV waves? Does it mean that right under the epicenter Rayleigh waves cannot form but at some distance from it in order to reach second critical angles?</p>

<p>I have some understanding of plate tectonics but I struggle with understanding how the plate boundaries have changed in terms of their actual spatial positions over long periods of time.  For example, what would the 'jigsaw pattern' of plates at the time of Pangea have looked like?  At plate margins, does the pressure of compression or expansion actually change the spatial position of the margin?  <a href=""http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/DLAHowManyPlates.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anderson</a> comments...
""The definition of a plate and a plate boundary is subjective. Things are constantly changing. It is improbable that there is a steady state or equilibrium configuration of plates because both ridges and trenches migrate and only a few of the 16 kinds of triple junctions are stable.""</p>

<p>This serves to confuse me further unfortunately.  I have no issues understanding how continents move around, it is the potential change to the size, shape, orientation and position of plates that baffles me!</p>

<p>This probably relates to the potential for new plate boundaries to be formed...and existing ones to close up.  Is this possible?  Sorry if this is an overly simple question.  If this is possible it could explain a lot.  A geologist friend told me that the East African Rift Valley is an example of a weakness in the crust that could turn into a plate margin.  If that's true that could explain a lot.  If new plates can form and existing ones disappear this would go a long way to solving my dilemma.</p>

<p>Any views would be much appreciated and I can then give my 12 year old pupil a decent answer!
Many thanks all.</p>

<p>PS. Just about every geography text book out there suggests plate tectonics is a result of convection currents in the mantle.  Many teachers teach this because that's what they've been taught.  I appreciate the science has moved on and now involved slab-pull and several other potential forces!  Without making it too complex, what should we be teaching 12+ year olds?</p>

"Barite and Acantharians","<p>Acantharians are planktonic protists (abundant in today oceans), sister-group to polycystine Radiolarians, that have the particularity of biomineralizing complex skeletons in strontium sulfate SrSO<sub>4</sub> (i. e. celestine). 
Those protists have no (as far as I know) fossil record for the good reason that celestine is soluble in seawater once the organism decayed. 
However it has been speculated (e. g. <strong>Bernstein et al. 1992</strong>) that acantharian-derived celestine could be at the origin of the formation of Sr-rich barite.  </p>

<p>What is the status of this hypothesis? If this is still considered true, is there a way to differentiate unambiguously acantharian-derived barite from other kind of barite?</p>

"How did tectonic plates originally come to form?","<p>Plate tectonics is a theory which describes Earth's lithosphere as being composed of distinct plates which are able to move atop of the underlying asthenosphere.  At plate boundaries, this movement can give rise to convergent boundaries where subduction may occur, divergent boundaries, where molten lava rises to fill the gaps between diverging plates, or sliding plates at transform boundaries.</p>

<p>While I understand why we have come to adopt this theory, what I am less clear about is why  Earth's lithosphere is composed of such distinct plates in the first place, and is it possible for existing plates to split into two distinct plates?  Is there a theory on how the Earth's plates were initially formed?</p>

"Alternatives to Plant Functional Types as parametrisations in land surface models?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_functional_type"">Plant Functional Types (PFTs)</a> are a discretisation of global vegetation types. They are used in land surface models to parametrise many values, including albedo, various photosynthesis parameters, and water use. These affect the resultant estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange of carbon (NEE), and heat and radiation budgets, and what happens to soil moisture. However, Alton (2011) has showed that for some of these parametrised variables, there is no significant difference between many commonly used PFTs. This means that PFTs may, in some cases, be a less than optimal method of deciding how each land surface model grid cell should operate.</p>

<p>Are there any alternative parametrisations of the global land surface that could provide more, or better information to land surface models? Perhaps based on soil types, or even statistical parametrisations (like something PCA based)? If so, are any in use in any current land surface models?</p>

"How much heat is transported from the interior to the surface in the form of hydration enthalpy?","<p>Heat is transferred from the interior to the surface through several methods. One is simply the conduction of sensible heat through the crust - I would guess this accounts for most of it. But some is also transferred through another route: when crust is subducted, it becomes dehydrated, which absorbs heat. Elsewhere, new crust is created and becomes hydrated, which releases heat. The net effect is the transfer of heat from the interior to the surface, but it is transferred in the form of hydration enthalpy rather than sensible heat. A similar process is serpentinisation, which transfers energy in the form of chemical bonds.</p>

<p>I'm looking for data about the total (net) amount of energy that is transferred from the interior to the surface in the form of hydration enthalpy and heat of serpentinisation, as opposed to sensible heat? Is it a substantial fraction of the total ~45TW figure?</p>

"Traits of invaded ecosystems? Are my compost worms a threat to New York?","<p>I was shocked to learn that there were few native worms in the glaciated portion of North America. I use worms indoors to compost paper and kitchen scraps. I don't think there is much chance of transfer as my garden is on the roof of an apartment. I was still surprised that my worms are essentially invaders in some parts of this country.</p>

<p>Thinking about all of this lead me to look up the damage done by non-native worms in North America. They have an impact on plants that once relied on the matted leaves on the forest floor. So, they can lead to more barren undergrowth. The native worms are not good at competing for some reason.</p>

  edge.” For Hamilton, this effect was “beyond science fiction,” he

The most obvious one would be dissolved gases. <a href=""http://www.egs.ab.ca/resources/Documents/Hamilton_Talk_4-Forest_rings.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">And this paper</a> does provide information to this direction. But with closer study, <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/21/1/005/meta"" rel=""noreferrer"">the influence of the gases can be only 0.16 ppm.</a> This means that the density change must come from water temperature.

"Could a large burst of super-heated or super-cooled air cause tornadoes to fall apart?","<p>We know how tornadoes form: when areas of hot air and cold air mingle, causing rotation. We can even see them form on the radar. </p>

<p>Yet, for all of our technology, we can't stop such events from happening - even though we <strong>can</strong> cause it to rain by seeding clouds. </p>

<p>But if someone were at the area that a tornado was about to form and was able to introduce an area of super-heated or super-cooled air into the potential tornado, would it destabilize the formation of the destructive whirlwind? Or would doing such a thing cause more of them to form or for them to form more quickly and/ or be more damaging?  </p>

<p>I think that in faults in general the fault plane is inclined to the horizontal, and the hanging wall is the mass of rocks above the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is larger, and the foot wall is the mass of rocks below the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is smaller. 
In the second figure, we have a hanging wall on the left side and we have a foot wall on the right side, and it seems that the hanging wall is moving down relative to the foot wall, and that's what happens in normal faults not reverse ones, right? So why we consider the thrust fault in figure one as a reverse fault?</p>

<p>b. With that what area of reforestation/afforestation would need to be offset by 10% by the same emissions?</p>

<p>How I solved (not sure if correct):</p>

<p>Since 45,000 is in acres I converted to square meters:</p>

<p>45,000Acres = 182,108,539.008 M^2</p>

<p>Then I could say for every 0.25 there would be one M^2 from the above number. Therefore I multiplied.</p>

<p>0.25*182,108,539.008 = 45527134.752 kgC</p>

<p>So now I need to convert kg to ton:</p>

<p>45527134.752 kg = 50185.08 tons</p>

<p>So now I just need to divide into 140,000.000 to find how much it knocks off of the total carbon emitted:</p>

<p>140,000.000 / 50185.08 = 2.8%</p>

I'd imagine for 10% I'd just have to adjust the arcrage to get it just right. With land area being 25,414,258,332.672 m^2</p>

<p>My community has single-bin recycling. Most consumer-level metal, plastic, and paper can go in there to be sorted at a recycling center. They don't take plastic grocery bags, cellophane, paper towels, and pizza boxes. Most of these I can recycle at a more specialized location if I'm feeling like a good citizen.</p>

<p>So most of garbage is food, paper towels, and cellophane.</p>

<p>I'm researching composting, and it seems like the only ""organic"" things I can't compost are cooked meat and dairy products. A site I'm reading mentions ""some paper"". Maybe that means paper towels.</p>

<p>But what I'm wondering is, what would be left after disposing of everything I can using the above methods? I get that this is a question with technically an unbounded answer. The sites I've read so far say something like ""everything else!"" I get that. But what do most people regularly consume and dispose of that wouldn't go in the ""trash"" bin if they had bins for trash, recycling, compost?</p>

<p>The first thing that jumps to mind is batteries, but those shouldn't be thrown in the trash if we followed their instructions. Big items like old computers or broken chairs (or whatever) don't normally go in the bin, and generally have better options for getting rid of them (donations, etc.).</p>

<p>So if I'm doing the <em>mostly</em> bare minimum but still following the basic rules on all of the above, what would be left? Dirty diapers and greasy pizza boxes and blocks of cheese that went bad?</p>

<p>I feel like I must be forgetting something obvious.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"How is surface pressure generally measured, and at what actual height?","<p>In various atmospheric equations, surface pressure is one of the variables used. For example, in calculating the density of air or pressure-corrected relative optical air mass. How is surface pressure measured? </p>

<p>I imagine it's the pressure at the height of a sensor on a weather station. Is that considered effectively pressure at Earth's surface / a good-enough approximation, or do scientists generally adjust measurements from weather stations to be corrected for the height difference between the sensor and Earth's surface? Or is surface pressure measured by a sensor actually at Earth's surface?</p>

(2014)</a>'s Nature article, which essentially states that groundwater depletion and subsequent crustal unloading causes a decrease in the stress normal to the San Andreas fault, thus bringing the fault ""closer to failure"" (to quote from the abstract).</p>

<p>Does that mean, as Eric Holthaus, the author of the Slate post suggests, Amos and his co-authors believe that due to the drought, the next ""major"" earthquake may not be quite as significant in magnitude? (The idea being that an increase in small-magnitude slip events over several years will help ease the intensity of short-period rupture propagation during a larger event?) Or, does it mean that the released stress is just being redistributed to locked sections of the fault system, which I assume experience decreased Mohr–Coulomb forces due to the region wide groundwater draw down? Elsewhere in the Slate article, for example, Holthaus notes that the <a href=""http://space.io9.com/geology-of-the-napa-valley-earthquake-1626288018?invitelink"">August 2014 Napa Earthquake</a> actually <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26106-californian-earthquake-piles-stress-on-dangerous-fault.html#.VUwM_GTBzGf"">redistributed some of its released stress</a> onto the Hayward Fault, which doesn't quite seem to support the ""easing"" hypothesis.</p>

<p>Am I wrong in thinking that the two ideas referenced (easing vs. redistribution) might be mutually exclusive? I sort of wish Holthaus had delved a little deeper in his analysis, since it seems that the clarity of the Slate article takes a fair hit from this inconsistency.</p>

"Flexure of a viscous lithosphere - derivation","<p>I have been trying to figure out solution for the fourth order differential equation of flexure for a viscous plate. </p>

<p>The fourth order differential equation for a viscous plate is given as</p>

<p>$$Dv*\dfrac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4}\bigg(\dfrac{\partial w}{\partial t}\bigg) + kw = 0,$$</p>

<p>here, $Dv$ is a function of viscosity and elastic thickness, and $k$ is the specific weight. 
My solution so far is 
$$w = w_0*\exp(t/b)*\exp(-x/\alpha)*\cos(x/\alpha),$$ 
where, $w_0$ is the maximum deflection, $b$ is function of $Dv$, $k$ and $\alpha$; and $\alpha$ is function of $Dv$ and $k$.</p>

<p>The problem with my derivation is I am not sure if it correct and I do not have a way to check it. Moreover, the $b$ term is an issue as it resolves to constant integer, which is not physically likely.

When it makes contact with the atmosphere, it becomes a ""meteor"".  When it hits the surface, it becomes a ""meteorite"".  But changing one's name based on a change in location is, at best, superficial and has no relation to chemistry and composition.</p>

<li>Outer Core, molten iron</li>

"How much and what kind of radiation passes through a cloud?","<p>I've read that 80% of sunlight is passing through clouds. Now there a small clouds and big clouds so it should be some average. Is this true or is the amount of sunlight passing throug a cloud really much more depending on the size of clouds. Is it for instance on a totally cloudy day that only 30% is passing and on a nice summerday when a cloud comes by it is 90%. Probably it depend on how high in length the clouds are.</p>

<p>But perhaps even a more interesting question is, are all wavelengths passing though on the same level? So is uv-light passing even easy as infrared light? In my experience though when walking in the sun it feels that much more than 20% of those warm IR-rays are being blocked by clouds (even if they are very tiny). So is it possible that even 70% of the IR rays are blocked or perhaps relatively moren than visible light or UV-light?</p>

"Desalination and Weather Impact?","<p>I have a question I've always been curious about regarding the topic.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the desalination process is that they take the salt water, create usable water from it and then salt sludge is pumped back out into the ocean.  When I've read about it an issue from this seems to be that the waste is bad to the ecosystem they pump it back into plus that extra salt can't be that good for the ocean as a whole and its inhabitants.  I understand that one plant might not be that much of an impact on the ocean as a whole but if it became more standard and over 50yrs+, especially with the changing climate and droughts maybe it would and there are greater ecological issues.</p>

<p>My question is:
Why can't they just pump the salt water into a designated area in the desert?  </p>

<p>I live in California and we have plenty of desert and every time I head out toward Las Vegas or travel up north I think about this.  </p>

<p>Why couldn't some chunk of land be allocated where raw salt water can be pumped into and then let it evaporate?  Wouldn't that just generate more rain which, at least in the winter, create more snow pack in the mountains and help create drinking water more naturally?  The salt and stuff left behind could just stay there and become a salt flat.  At a minimum couldn't they process the water and then pump the sludge into the desert (the remaining water would still evaporate) and it seems to me that would be a better solution than putting it back into the ocean for it to have more salt.</p>

<p>If it could be done on a reasonable scale, maybe some land that was once unusable could be terraformed to forest which would help with the climate, pull carbon out of the air, and on a 5 or 10 year cycle the trees can be cut down made into mulch and then new ones planted...  Not the salt water or land where the salt is left but additional land allocation for this (we do have a LOT of desert) and I know sand would need to be cultivated but we also have a lot of cows and organic material we can use to help convert the sand into more usable soil.</p>

<p>Running some pipes from a coast inland while posing some logistical challenge doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  Better than oil pipelines...</p>

Obviously the intrusion must have occurred later than the deposits of layers B, C and D, but how can I tell if the intrusion occurred before or after the deposit of layer A?  In my opinon, both of these scenarios are possible.  The intrusion does not appear to cross through A, so I suppose it is possible that A was deposited after the intrusion.  But isn't it also possible that A was deposited before the intrusion, and the intrusion simply did not make it past layer B?</p>

Perhaps a bit naive, since the sensors may not be accurate enough for scientific studies, and if it's a consumer product they would likely have a dense install base in metropolitan areas and less in the countryside/oceans.</p>

"Good practices and pitfalls when fitting models $y = f(weather)$ and predicting $\hat{y} = \hat{f}(GCM)$","<p>I've got a phenomenon of interest, $y$.  It is determined in large part by the weather.  Naturally, one becomes interested in what climate change may do to $y$, so one fits a model of the form $y = f(\mathbf{X}) + \epsilon$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a potentially high-dimensional representation of historical weather.</p>

<p>To get a sense of impacts into the future, one uses the fitted model $\hat{f}$ applied to (downscaled) GCM projections of weather.  Given uncertainty in which model provides the most faithful representation of the distribution of weather given CO2, one should compute a distribution of $\hat{y}$ as </p>

<ul>
<li>$\hat{f}(GCM_1)$</li>
<li>$\hat{f}(GCM_2)$</li>
<li>$\hat{f}(GCM_3)$</li>
<li>$\vdots$</li>
<li>$\hat{f}(GCM_k)$</li>
</ul>

<p>A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>GCMs get some things badly wrong, like convective precipitation.  Is it good practice to make sure that your model $f$ and your training data $\mathbf{X}$ represent things like convective precip at an appropriate level of coarseness, such that the GCM can be roughly ""correct""?  For example, should I only use monthly summaries of precip from a GCM, even if the GCM's raw output gives it to me sub-daily?  What are some other examples of things that GCMs don't do well, that one might consider coarsening?</li>
<li>One shouldn't average GCM output across multiple models, obviously.  But it makes more sense to average $\hat{y}_{GCM_1}, \hat{y}_{GCM_3}, \hat{y}_{GCM_3}, \dots, \hat{y}_{GCM_k}$.  But should this be a simple average, or should the average be weighted somehow to account for the fact that some models are more similar to one another than other models?  And how would this be practically done, given that the GCM's are so high-dimensional that it becomes impossible to calculate distance metrics?</li>
<li>Given that historical simulations exist, one can compute a ""backcast"" projection $\tilde{y} = \hat{f}(GCM_k^{historical})$, and then compute a ``bias'' term $B = E[\tilde{y}] - E[y]$.  (Naturally one would use a difference in means, rather than a pointwise difference, because GCMs attempt to model the distribution of the weather, rather than realized weather.)  If the estimated bias $B$ is nontrivial, should I add it to my projections, forming $\hat{y}_{BC} = \hat{y} - B$?  Or is there a better way to achieve the same end?</li>

"Is there a maximum size for a single snowflake?","<p>Just based on my previous experiences a wetter snow, in general, has larger flakes.  Some online sources say that raindrops do have a maximum size before they start to break apart when surface tension can no longer withstand air resistance, however the maximum size of a snowflake is less defined (1&amp;2).  One source also states that light winds and a wetter snow is more conducive to larger flakes because the light wind helps keep them from breaking into pieces, and the additional moisture creates a film which helps the flakes stick together (2).</p>

<p>I understand that it may be difficult to measure a snowflake before it melts and that may be why the only non-confirmed size that I have found is from the 2014 Guinness Book of World Records of an eye witness account in 1887 of a snowflake 15"" wide by 18"" deep (3).   </p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a theoretical limit to how large a single snowflake can be?</li>
<li>If there is a reliable way to measure snowflakes, what is the largest
snowflake ever measured?</li>
</ul>

"Are there areas of desert sands which experience blizzards?","<p>Building off of another question I recently asked (<a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/14214/is-there-sand-in-antarctica"">Is there sand in Antarctica?</a>) I want to ask a broader question coming from the same motive described there.</p>

"Does nitrate take a particular long time to percolate from surface into groundwater?","<p>In a recent discussion with a farmer, the (at least in northwestern Germany) ""popular"" topic of nitrate infiltration into groundwater came up. The general view is that lots of fields receive more nitrate fertilizer than the plants can use, this then percolates through the ground and eventually shows up in the groundwater that is also used as drinking water. So far so plausible. Raised nitrate content in groundwater is indeed often observed. </p>

<p>One should probably add that in this area, a lot of agriculture is raising of hogs and cattle, consequently much of the fertilizer is manure that has a (compared to commercial fertilizer) low NPK content and is thus not worth to transport over far distances. So there's an incentive to dispose on ones own fields, nearby.</p>

<p>Now, this farmer claimed that the nitrate content we see now is decades old, that the bylaws and controls as well as agricultural practices in place now work. Is this true? Does nitrate penetrate ground so slowly? The only mechanism here I could think of that nitrate is adsorbed and desorbed on minerals in the ground, sort of like in chromotography column.</p>

<p>If neccessary, I can provide more figures for nitrate content of specific wells, groundwater table etc - but I don't think it's neccessary since I want a qualitative answer wether or not such a slow infiltration is plausible at all.</p>

"What's the difference between these most basic, first-order models for estimating runoff?","<p>There are a lot of variations of basic, first-order hydrology models to estimate runoff from rainfall with a few other parameters. From what I can tell, most very basic rainfall-runoff models use one of the following methods at their core: the
<a href=""https://engineering.purdue.edu/mapserve/LTHIA7/documentation/scs.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">SCS Curve Number method</a>, the <a href=""https://www.lmnoeng.com/Hydrology/rational.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rational method</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.hydrocad.net/pdf/NY-Simple-Method.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Simple method</a>. I'm trying to understand: <strong>how do these methods differ, and are there other methods used at the core of basic, first-order hydrology models?</strong> </p>

<p>From what I can tell, the SCS Curve Number method is only slightly different from the Rational method in that it uses a Curve Number (based on land use and soils) rather than a Runoff Coefficient (based on soil and basin slope). The two are both event-based models, at least in their initial design.</p>

<p>The Simple method appears to be a lot like the Rational method but the former is for estimating pollutant loading (using pollutant coefficients and runoff) while the latter is for estimating runoff (using runoff coefficients and rainfall). I could see the two being coupled, but they don't appear to have any redundancy in their use.</p>

<p>Considering the summary of my findings, <strong>can these methods be described together as ""empirical models""</strong> given that they are all based on empirically derived coefficients (either Curve Number values, runoff coefficients, or pollutant coefficients)?</p>

"Did the Geothermal Power Plant contribute to Pahoa's Lava Fissures?","<p>There was lava in the area near the wells that the Puna Geothermal Venture facility created.</p>

<p>8,000 feet is really quite deep. While I understand that those are not the deepest wells created for geothermal energy, in Hawaii that seems deep enough to get to where lava would also be pooling. </p>

<p>For example, it would be deep enough to hit the pool at one of the main volcanoes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rocks that are moving upward in the mantle beneath Hawai`i begin to melt about 40 to 60 miles (60 to 100 km) depth. The molten rock, called magma , rises because of its relatively low density.

"By how much did the Earth's diameter decrease due to cooling, if at all, since it was formed?","<p>The answer to <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/2523/how-long-until-earths-core-solidifies/"">How long until Earth's core solidifies?</a> question cites an estimation that the Earth (as a planet, not the surface of it) has cooled down by about 250K since it was formed.</p>

<p>The question is, just by how much the Earth's effective/average diameter has decreased because of this cooling? </p>

<p>Also, considering that the Earth's crust has appeared ""almost immediately"" -- about a hundred million years -- after the Earth's formation, what has happened to it because if this cooling?</p>

<p>There is also the effect of the Earth's mass increase due to its gravitation pulling cosmic dust as well as cosmic bodies falling onto it, which surpass the loss of mass through the atmosphere, thus slightly increasing the weight of crust and its pressure against the mantle.</p>

<p>Obviously, the crust is too (relatively) thin and weak to allow emptinesses/cavities/hollows appearing under itself because of the shrinkage of the inner matter, so it was breaking in places thus forming continents that float over the mantle and ""falling"" downwards a bit instead, right?</p>

<p>Or the additional volume because of the cooling did not really change the Earth's effective/average diameter at all since the mantle (and deeper layers) was pushing against the crust with high pressure in the first place so the decrease of volume of the Earth's innards did not happen and it all only ended up decreasing the pressure against the crust, thus decreasing volcanic activity instead of changing the effective/average diameter of the planet?</p>

"Temperature Advection using finite differences with gridded data","<p>Advection of a scalar quantity, such as temperature (<em>T</em>), by the horizontal wind, is defined as follows:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$-\textbf{U}\cdot\nabla T$</span></p>

<p>where <span class=""math-container"">$\textbf{U}$</span> is the horizontal wind vector, <span class=""math-container"">$\textbf{U}=(u,v)$</span>, being <span class=""math-container"">$u$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$v$</span> its zonal and meridional components, respectively (<a href=""http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Advection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>).</p>

<p>To compute it with gridded data, it is convenient to use finite differences (or similar numerical approaches), as pointed <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/9634/how-to-compute-du-dx-and-dv-dy-in-moisture-flux-convergence/10667#10667"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Using this method, the following lines written in Python calculate the advection of temperature (TAdv):</p>



<pre><code>dy=111000 # [m]
lonres=lon[1]-lon[0] # constant
tadv=np.zeros(np.shape(T)); tadv.fill(np.nan)
for t in range(np.shape(T)[0]):
    for x in np.arange(1,len(lon)-1):
        for y in np.arange(1,len(lat)-1):
            dx = abs(111000*np.cos(lat[y]*(2*np.pi/360))*lonres)
            tadv[t,y,x] = -(u[t,y,x]*(T[t,y,x+1]-T[t,y,x-1])/(2*dx) +\
                              v[t,y,x]*(T[t,y+1,x]-T[t,y-1,x])/(2*dy))
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect a similar result from scaling the wind components by the temperature, at each grid cell, which is done as follows:</p>



<pre><code>ut  = np.zeros(np.shape(T))
vt  = np.zeros(np.shape(T))
UT  = np.zeros(np.shape(T))
for t in range(np.shape(T)[0]):
    for x in range(len(lon)):
        for y in range(len(lat)):
            ut[t,y,x] = u[t,y,x]*abs(T[t,y,x])
            vt[t,y,x] = v[t,y,x]*abs(T[t,y,x])
            UT[t,y,x] = ((ut[t,y,x]**2 + vt[t,y,x]**2)**0.5)*np.sign(T[t,y,x])
</code></pre>

<p>The magnitude of the scaled wind vectors (UT) would be then similar to this ""amount of transport of T"". It is multiplied by the sign of T (-1 or 1), because T are anomalies (there is T&lt;0), in order to keep its the sign.</p>

<p>However, the results are totally different. What I am missing here? Is it a mistake in this assumption (that both results should look fairly similar)? Or is it a coding problem?</p>

<p>In the figure below, I show the original T, u and v fields (left), and the results of the two above calculations: Tadv with u and v (middle), and the magnitude of the scaled vectors, UT, with the scaled vectors themselves uT and vT (right). TAdv is multiplied by 24*3600, so that the units are K/day. </p>

"Bifurcation Scenarios in the Atmosphere","<p>I read that the mathematical definition of bifurcation is that, at a critical value of a parameter that governs the dynamical system, the system changes to a topologically different system than the previous.</p>

<p>Why is this phenomenon relevant in atmospheric sciences?</p>

<p>One can say that since the topology of the systems orbit changed, so different, previously unaccounted for, phenomena will show up - but that is obvious. </p>

<p>Why, if at all, should a climatologist trying to predict a long term time series keep bifurcation in mind, given they can also compute the results numerically within the limits of precision, without explicitly worrying about bifurcation?</p>

Almost all the glaciers, on Rienatčohkka, Storsteinsfjellet, Ristačohkka, and others, are on the east side of the mountains, while the west side is mostly bare.  If the precipitation is orographic, shouldn't it fall on the west side?  Then why is the east side more glaciated?  Is this a typical effect, or is there a strange situation locally?</p>

<li>There won't be any flood, because the volume of polar ice is small compared to the whole world.</li>

"Measurement of groundwater levels","<p>There are numerous measurement systems available for measuring groundwater levels (head / stage). What period of time should measurements be collected in order to draw solid conclusions about the average groundwater level, min/ max, trends, etc?</p>

<p>Long measurement periods (several years) are often unwanted, due to the need for fast results. So the optimum between research duration and solid conclusions lies somewhere in between I presume. </p>

<p>EDIT:
There is a factory which is investigating the possible use of groundwater for their industrial process. Enviromental law dictates that the effects of the substraction on the long term groundwaterlevels have to be investigated. 
The first question then becomes: what is the current long term variability in groundwaterlevel? Only then we can continue with answering what the effects of the substraction will be.</p>

"is the low-compressibility of seawater responsible for its bouyancy?","<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around water's density, low-compressibillity and bouyancy. Are all these 3 things related, if so, how? </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested if water's low compresibillity of responsible for the physiological appearance of marine organisims.</p>

<p>For example, small marine organisms are held by the density of water and as a result have amorphous spherical bodies suspended in a relatively viscous material.

Consequently, you can deduce an organism's body size simply by looking at their body shape. </p>

<p>Or a briefer example, marine mammals' body weight are supported against gravity by the buoyancy of water, hence why oxygen-breathing marine mammals die when stranded as a result of crushing their organs through body weight.</p>

"Can the atmosphere affect the composition of igneous rocks?","<p>Recently I was reading <a href=""http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9691.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'How to build a habitable planet'</a> by Langmuir and Broecker and in chapter 15 they speak about how Life has led to a difference in oxidation potential in the atmosphere, essentially leading to the earth becoming a fuel cell. They also spoke about how this led to certain ions being oxidized - ie uraninite to uranyl oxide, iron to hematite.</p>

<p>I was wondering if this could mean that as atmospheric composition would affect the sea floor, when this subducted it would affect the melt of the mantle - as far as I'm aware, it is the dehydration of the subducting slab which allows for the hydration, and therefore melt, of the mantle in regions such as Japan. If the subducting slab's composition is affected by the atmosphere, could this have any effect on the composition of the igneous rocks formed? Would this be detectable?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Quoting from the study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data
  sets are not a valid representation of reality,” the authors wrote.
  “In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that
  removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent
  with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it
  is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that
  recent years have been the warmest ever — despite current claims of
  record setting warming.""</p>

Further googling only turned up more references in political-influence sources like TheBlaze.com.</p>

<p>The one place that may be presenting as something that they published is the Heartland Institute (<a href=""https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/on-the-validity-of-noaa-nasa-and-hadley-cru-global-average-surface-temperature-data--the-validity-of-epas-co2-endangerment-finding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), but I cannot tell if they are legit or not.</p>

<p>There is no publication information in the paper itself, nor any evidence of formal ""peer-review"" other than the list of scientists(?) on page 2 who affirm that they agree with the conclusions (which is not my understanding of what peer-review means nor of how it works).</p>

"Are the oceans rising or the continents going down? How can we know?","<p>The century old sustained rising of oceans, at a rate of 2-4 mm/y, remains a unexplained phenomenon; there is no correlation with temperature variations, so it is not due to the thermal variation of the volume of the oceans or to a decrease of Antarctic ice (which in fact is increasing).</p>

<p>A possibility, given that this raise of the oceans is not absolute but relative to coast, is that it is not the oceans’ absolute level that is raising but the continents that are sinking. A possible cause is global oscillations of the mantle surface level, and tectonic plates move up and down besides drifting.  Another cause is the solidification of the mantle under continental plates due to the decrease of Earth internal temperature. What do you think? Are the oceans rising or the continents going down (in average)? Only satellite measurements can solve the riddle? </p>

I read that the magnitude 7.8 richter scale earhtquake would have caused more damage had it lasted for longer time. In case of Nepal it lasted for nearly 30 seconds.

"Digging depth and heat","<p>I have a question about the underground heat at different distances from the core of the Earth.</p>

<p>Here are the assumptions that I am using:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lower an object is, the cooler the air around it and therefore the cooler the object can become. Cold air tends to sink below heated air. (I'm thinking like a basement is cooler than the top floor during summer without air conditioning).</li>
<li>The deeper you dig towards the centre of the earth, the hotter your surroundings become. (While there may be some initial decrease in temperature, I'm assuming as you dig towards the mantle or core the hotter the ground around you is).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am holding constant the heat from the sun and atmosphere. Is there a defined depth at which the loss of heat (from falling cool air) = gain in heat (from the heat of the earth)? Does the shape of the hole dug affect the depth at which this occurs?</p>

"How can I learn to spot fossils and fossil-bearing rocks on the Jurassic coast?","<p>Due to a pleasant change in my circumstances, I have been to Lyme Regis several times recently, and it seems as though I'm going to be a regular visitor over the next few years.</p>

<p>As a former biologist I found the experience of combing the shore of the famous Jurassic coast for fossils to be delightfully addictive. Having spent about six hours over three days doing so, I've amassed a decent collection of ammonite fragments. Having got the bug for doing this, I'm eager to try and find some more impressive specimens.</p>

<p>Chatting to some of the local palaeontologists on the beach it became apparent that to do so you need to split rocks, and that you need to know which rocks to split.

"How high could snow form on a mountain?","<p>I was reminded recently of a moment in the Eragon books where the main characters see a ""tall"" mountain range, and then after a minute realize that the white sky stretching up above them is just mountains too, covered in snow. Which got me wondering - if there was a mountain that reached to space, obviously there would be some point above which snow would not accumulate. Where would this be?</p>

<p>Thoughts: I know most of the Earth's moisture is in the troposphere, so it seems reasonable to assume it would be confined to that region - but higher clouds like nacreous and noctilucent clouds are made of ice crystals, which could conceivably deposit on a mountain. Or would this be rare enough that it would sublimate faster than it could accumulate?</p>

A perfect geostrophic balance does not have rotation, and I understand that in that case we would have frequency=0. But a little departure from that could give rise to large scale geostrophic gyro (like low pressure systems in the athmosphere). Would not that gyro be associated with a frequency, in the same way the inertial gyro has a frequency?  Why it is common to say the geostrophic flows do not have a frequency? For a geostrophic gyro it still takes a certain time to rotate around a center of rotation.</p>

<p>The article says that the ammonia which escapes the soil and is released into the atmosphere ultimately leads to the production of PM2.5 and is a major source of pollution harmful to people. It links to the new paywalled paper in Nature <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0261-y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air-quality-related health damages of maize</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would be the chemical and/or physical processes by which traces of ammonia in the air would lead to PM2.5 production? </p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study estimates that ""4,300 premature deaths can be attributed to corn production,"" says Hill. ""That's about a quarter of all [air pollution-related] agricultural deaths. That's significant.""</p>
  
  <p>The vast majority, 86 percent, of PM2.5 emissions happen on farms, with the rest occurring elsewhere in the supply chain, according to the study. The main culprit?</p>
  
  <p>Fertilizer application.</p>
  
  <p>""Ammonia from fertilizer application accounted for about 70 percent of attributable deaths,"" says Hill. The nitrogen in fertilizers helps fuel plant growth, but not all of it can be used by the plant. ""Some of that nitrogen washes into waterways, and some of it gets released into the atmosphere as ammonia,"" says Hill.</p>
  
  <p>Once ammonia hits the atmosphere, it reacts with other particles, mostly nitrogen and sulfur oxides, to form PM2.5, according to Hill.</p>

<p>My question is, if you were at around 5800ft in a tropical/subtropical region of India, would the climate then be more like a temperate zone or an alpine climate, but with monsoons?</p>

<p>To put it another way, my question has a general aspect to it too, which is: what happens to a tropical zone as the land increases in elevation? Does it become more ""temperate"" or ""alpine"" for all practical purposes? And what ""tropical"" factors remain in effect (for example, sunlight, I'm guessing)? </p>

<p>Further information: It's in the Nilgiri Hills, Tamil Nadu, in a region called Bengal Mattam. There's a small stream that runs through the farm, right at the border, all along the lowest point of our farm/the hillside. The stream then turns sharply and in one kilometer from that turning point, empties into an irregularly shaped reservoir, which is about 669 meters from one end to other, and about 250 on two other extremes.

"Why is the night very bright in the Himalayas?","<p>Some years ago I had the chance to climb the Himalayas. Not the Everest of course, but the Annapurna Base Camp which is about 4km above sea level.</p>

<p>During the night of the stay I went out to do some stargazing and I found that the night was very bright, so bright that I was able to make out letters on a book. (Of course I didn't read.) I figured that since there was practically no light coming from the ground within several kilometers to illuminate the air, the light from the moon and the stars were comparatively bright (just the opposite of why we can't see stars clearly from a city).</p>

<p>But recently it hit me that, well, night is supposed to be dark. Anyone who lived outside cities will tell me that.  Lack of light source from the ground will make the moon <em>appear</em> brighter because there will be greater contrast but it won't make moonlight reaching the ground any brighter, will it? So this confused me. How was that night in the Himalayas so bright? Is it an expected thing if I'm so high up, or are there some factors that might have made that particular night so bright? Or are nights outside cities normally bright regardless of the altitude (assuming clear sky and near-full moon)?</p>

<p>One thing I suppose could be the reason is that the thinner air due to the altitude meant there was less scattering of the light. I'm not sure if the air was thin enough to make such a difference though.</p>

"What would a replacement for SEGY look like?","<p>I have been having a miserable time this week reading <a href=""http://www.seg.org/documents/10161/77915/seg_y_rev1.pdf"">SEGY</a> files. This is data from the largest seismic acquisition company in the world whose client is the 7th largest oil company in the world. So if anyone could get it right you would think it would be these two. </p>

<p>The SEGY standard for storing seismic data is used throughout the oil industry but is showing it's age quite badly. Problems include:</p>

<ul>
<li>non standard header information</li>
<li>the textual header can be in ASCII or EBCDIC</li>
<li>crazy machinations to save a few bytes</li>
<li>binary data stored in IEEE or IBM floating point</li>
<li>etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the most glaring deficiencies are being patched up with a v2 release in the works. Details are here: <a href=""http://www.seg.org/documents/51956/6062543/SEGY+2.0+draft+February+2014"">http://www.seg.org/documents/51956/6062543/SEGY+2.0+draft+February+2014</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a standard you can implement just by reading the spec and this new version won't help fix that. The continual abuse of the standard means that it takes calendar years to 'debug into existence' a library that can withstand real world data files. This is hugely frustrating for both the software developers and the geoscientists who have to work with it. </p>

<p>There was a discussion on <a href=""http://www.agilegeoscience.com/"">this excellent blog</a> recently where HDF5 was mentioned </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2014/3/27/how-to-load-seg-y-data.html"">http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2014/3/27/how-to-load-seg-y-data.html</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2014/3/26/what-is-seg-y.html"">http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2014/3/26/what-is-seg-y.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would prefer to see a new standard that is less complicated than SEGY and with no dependencies on third party libraries. So while I think technologies like <a href=""http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/"">HDF5</a> (and <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/javaseis/index.php?title=Main_Page"">JavaSeis</a> etc.) may have a role within a company they are not a replacement for SEGY. Even a technology like XML is going to be outlived by the data files we will have to read in the future. So I think the format will need to be extremely simple and conservative. </p>

<p>Some features of a format that could replace SEGY might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>one character encoding (ASCII or UTF-8)</li>
<li>all headers in human readable form – key-value pairs?</li>
<li>mandatory header information, e.g. shotpoints, x/y locations etc. </li>
<li>standard unit definitions, map projections etc. </li>
<li>traces may be binary but only IEEE</li>
<li>data should be in one file (SEGY got this right)</li>
<li>no data compression</li>
</ul>

<p>So now for the question – what do we have to do to move beyond the extremely frustrating SEGY standard? Is there anything out there already we should just start evangelizing? If not, what do you think a replacement format needs to look like? </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I feel much better after this rant and will get back to debugging why byte number 3603 is wrong. </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: After chilling out over the weekend here are some more thoughts. SEGY is complicated for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>inherent complexity</li>
<li>accidental complexity</li>
<li>different expectations for the format from users</li>
</ul>

<p>So SEGY is hard to use because the seismic problem domain is an inherently difficult one to model. We are lucky to have the benefit of the wisdom of those who came up with the format. </p>

<p>Even so, a lot of cruft has accumulated in the format over the years. This creates a non-trivial cognitive burden that I could do without but will realistically just have to deal with. </p>

<p>The last point though is interesting. We already have SEGD for storing the raw field data. This format is a lot more challenging than SEGY but is also a good place to bury a lot of the inherent complexity of real world seismic data. </p>

<p>When people suggest HDF as a replacement I guess that (maybe) they are viewing SEGY as a 'processing' format? </p>

<p>Last week I was thinking of SEGY as a vehicle for sharing final seismic volumes with interpreters. I read at the weekend that 80% of SEGY headers are not populated in real world data. So, this is speculation on my part, but perhaps what we need is</p>

<ul>
<li>SEGD for raw field data</li>
<li>something else for actually processing </li>
<li>and something else again for sharing data between processors and interpreters</li>
</ul>

<p>To accurately, and reproducibly, load seismic data into interpretation systems we don't need much meta-data but it absolutely does need to be present. The hand-off from processors to interpreters via SEGY is where I think we could use a new approach. </p>

"How does the lapse rate in clouds compare with the lapse rate of air?","<p>So moisture decreases the temperature lapse rate (relative to the dry adiabat). My question is this: does a cloud decrease the lapse rate at the same rate as 100% humidity would decrease it? Or would it depend on cloud type (e.g. stratus vs cumulus)?</p>
"
"Are clouds significantly easier to simulate in weather models than climate models?","<p>Cloud forcing is still one of the major uncertainties of radiative forcing in climate modeling because there are so many uncertainties in it (and parametrizations). But also because the timescale of cloud development are much shorter than the timescale that climate models are run at.</p>

<p>So I'm curious: are clouds much easier to simulate in the short timespans of weather models? Or are they still a beast to simulate in them?</p>
"
"Why does the rising of high clouds due to climate change impart positive radiative feedback on radiative forcing?","<p>As seen in the figure below.</p>

<p>The larger the temperature difference between surface and cloud, the more positive the radiative forcing is from the cloud.</p>

<p>So as the cloud moves up, it supposedly should move into a colder altitude. But doesn't climate change also increase the temperatures at any given altitude too? If so, why does the cloud move up into a colder altitude due to climate change? (even after accounting for heating at the given altitude?)</p>

"Recharge a dry aquifer?","<p>Aquifers have a natural recharge rate.  However, some aquifers rely on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_water"">fossil water</a> for their primary (or even sole) water supply.  When water in a well is pulled from these aquifers faster than they can replenish, the level drops and they eventually ""dry up"" (or the water table drops below the bottom of the well, at least).  In the case of aquifers with no recharge, such as fossil water, it seems that the water could literally be used up so that the aquifer becomes completely dry.</p>

<p>For these fossil water aquifers, is there any known technique to recharge them?  Since they're labelled as a non-renewable resource, I presume the answer is ""no"", but I'd like to get a better understanding of this.</p>

<p>For aquifers with a low recharge rate and a severly dropped water table, is there any known way to increase their recharge rate?</p>

<p>since the earth moves toward the East, tides should move to the West, but there is only one, at the Antarctica, which goes in that direction and keeps pace with moon, although it never overtakes it, as it was supposed by the theory.</p>

<p>What people at Astronomy could not explain is why most tides move to the (North-) West, and that means they run faster than the earth's rotation. Can you explain that? Higher water is at a greater radius from the center of the Earth and must slow down because of conservation of AM,  how can they move faster?</p>

"Why is a mild earthquake often mistaken as dizziness or vertigo?","<p>Is it due to the longitudinal nature of the seismic waves?</p>

<p>When a heavy bus or truck goes by at high-speed, the shaking in nearby ground is <strong>not</strong> mistaken as dizziness, rather the feet and body feel a vertical jerk (seemingly a transverse wave vertical to the ground).</p>

<p>But when a natural, mild earthquake takes place, it is not felt as a jerk or switch in a direction at all. Rather we feel it for a while as dizziness. I have experienced this, and heard of many others who have as well.  In-fact <strong>it takes a few seconds to distinguish whether it is dizziness or an earthquake.</strong> </p>

<p>Is it due to the longitudinal waves? Is it because they are horizontal with the ground, matching the direction of dizziness?</p>

"How to derive the (dry) deposition velocity for particles in the atmosphere","<p>In atmospheric dispersion modelling the deposition velocity of particulate matter is often described by:
$$
v_d = \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g}+v_g \hspace{10mm}(1)
$$
where $r_A$ is the aerodynamic resistance (describing turbulent fluxes in the surface layer), $r_B$ is the viscous resistance (molecular diffusion in the quasi-laminar sublayer) and $v_g$ is the terminal fall velocity of the particles. </p>

<p>How is $(1)$ derived?</p>

<p>It is used in numerous models but I haven't found any references explaining how the expression is derived. The closest I've found is in <a href=""https://books.google.se/books?hl=sv&amp;lr=&amp;id=n_RmCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR23&amp;ots=gQM6KLscgL&amp;sig=UAVnf4v1jDmb_9Jd0cooP8BL_lM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">this book by Seinfeld and Pandis</a> (ISBN: 9781118947401), chapter 19.</p>

<p>There, it is explained that $(1)$ is derived from the following system of equations describing the total flux through an assumed constant flux layer:
$$
F
= \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3
= \frac{C_2+C_1}{r_B} + v_g C_2
= \frac{C_3-C_1}{r_t}
\hspace{10mm} (2)
$$
where $C_3$ is the particle concentration at the top of the surface layer, $C_2$ is the concentration between the surface layer and the viscous sublayer and $C_1$ is the concentration of still airborne particles at the surface.</p>

<p>At this stage it is assumed all particles close to the surface will adhere to the surface so that $C_1$ is practically 0. Then $(2)$ can be simplified to:
$$
\frac{C_3}{r_t}
= \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3
= \frac{C_2}{r_B} + v_g C_2
\hspace{10mm} (3)
$$</p>

<p>By elimination of $C_3$ and $C_2$ from $(3)$ one is supposed to end up with $(1)$, since $v_d=r_t^{-1}$. I've tried doing this but end up with this instead:
$$
v_d = \frac{1}{r_t}
= \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g} + \frac{v_g}{r_A(\frac{1}{r_B}+v_g) +1}
$$</p>

<p>So either my algebra is a bit rusty or there are additional assumption involved...</p>

"Is Ozone Layer a Valid Concern","<p>I’ve had a simple puzzlement concerning the ozone layer.  Succinctly, the troposphere is largely and preferably ozone free.  When it thermally rises at the tropics to become the stratosphere molecular oxygen cleaves under actinic radiation to from nascent oxygen that, in turn joins with molecular oxygen to form ozone.  The stratospheric ozone, of course, is vital to protect against harmful radiation.  Then at the polar vortices the flow once again returns to the troposphere.  Ozone is undesirable in the troposphere and is removed at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antarctic icebergs are large blocks of frozen fresh water that melt around the Antarctic continent while moving under the influence of winds, sea ice, and ocean currents. Small icebergs (2.2km) are mainly driven by winds and ocean currents, whereas giant icebergs
  (> 10 km) tend to ‘surf’ the tilted sea surface and are less sensitive to changes in the wind. The relative importance between melting at the iceberg’s base and mass loss at the side walls is also different for small and large icebergs.We present a computer simulation of Antarctic iceberg movement and melting that includes not only small icebergs, but at the same time also larger icebergs with side lengths of 10 km or more. The study highlights the necessity to account for larger icebergs in order to obtain an accurate depiction of the spatial distribution of iceberg meltwater, which, e.g., stabilizes and fertilizes the upper water column and thus supports phytoplankton growth. Future climate change simulations will benefit from the improved distribution, where the impact of iceberg melting is likely to increase due to increased calving from the Antarctic ice sheet.</p>

 (FESOM) to address the effect of the 3 dimensional ocean currents and wind pattern on the paths of icebergs and their addition of cold fresh water to the ocean.</p>

<p>At some point any predictive model will be compared against measured data, and traditionally satellite imaging provides the capability to track large numbers of icebergs with a wide range of sizes.</p>

<p>From the new BBC article <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40635883"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Drifting Antarctic iceberg A-68 opens up clear water</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A-68 should follow the highway up the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, leading from the Weddell Sea towards the Atlantic.</p>
  
  <p>""It will most likely follow a northeasterly course, heading roughly for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,"" Dr Rackow told BBC News. ""It will be very interesting to see whether the iceberg will move as expected, as a kind of 'reality-check' for the current models and our physical understanding.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The large size (~6,000 km^2) of the recently calved iceberg A-68 from the Larson-C ice shelf suggests it will will be relatively long lived, and so telemetry equipment placed on it is likely to collect data for a longer time than smaller ice bergs. I'm wondering if it might in fact be able as a sort of ""meteorological station"" of sorts, recording a variety of temperatures and currents and relaying the data via satellite. </p>

<p><strong>But my question</strong> is not if that is possible, but if it is likely to be done. Will A-68 get GPS beacons or more elaborate environmental telemetry in order to measure the local conditions? Having both the actual movement data together with the local environmental data may be of more value than satellite reconnaissance alone. </p>

<p>Petroleum and natural gas wells that have gone dry 50 years ago, are found replenishing a fraction of their output.  No fossils involved.</p>

<p>Vast <a href=""https://gsw.silverchair-cdn.com/gsw/Content_public/Journal/geology/39/3/10.1130_focus032011.1/2/287.pdf?Expires=1500070338&amp;Signature=BM8pz9XxjpBmQkcBK1re3emKnV5yV1XivHPpM2wczC-Tlfypz~jhlBPLSnSYWY3aAqtjFApaQIJK3p1z9kwuqTB6jsKS~1JrrWcHXcr3XkTEMNfq1kuRLtfVYPHX0QDxiSqmY8qouNl8vhH1OUs2inqn6r9nhgRPts-fu-KX4aBNXpl5eL3iJmjONPK96WLwnEJE2V1a-gXXDgwvL~CTiklKgVKIKQX0sftJao8uJdmfJhhkdqsRvA-iUi2GV8QbnVt8QPHzUGYxcXhJTnKXwkWKpqyjTwRSH~P6deT~T2i9SlW4ppi~d~uGyzKPZvgxURqRo4VnEDU8ulp~ppYTPw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biomass of micro-organisms</a> and extremophiles beneath earth surface estimated to be several times the size of the surface biomass found deriving their chemical energy for life from methane and oxygen pulled from sulfates and ferrous oxides.  The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils.  No fossils involved.</p>

<p>These recent findings and other evidence were foretold by the late scientist and researcher from Cornell, Thomas Gold, who authored ""<a href=""http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387952536"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Deep Hot Biosphere, The Myth of Fossil Fuels""</a>.</p>

<p>After seeing evidence of extremeophiles in relative abundance in even the <a href=""https://www.space.com/12491-worms-beneath-earth-surface-extremophiles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deepest of mines</a>, Gold ties the sub-surface biosphere to the ""Deep Earth Gas theory"" to show a more plausible primordial explanation of hydrocarbon fuel formation than the generally accepted ""fossil"" theory.</p>

<p>He posits that 
""Hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology (as the traditional view would hold), but rather hydrocarbons are geology reworked by biology.""  In other words, as in Saturn’s moon Titan and other hydrocarbon rich areas of the solar system, the source of hydrocarbons is <strong>primordial</strong>; but as they upwell into earth’s outer crust microbial life uses it as energy source.</p>

<p>While the details of the Deep Earth Gas Theory are beyond scope of elaboration in this question area, the main points which Dr. Gold supports, and provides evidence for are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hydrocarbons are primordial.</strong> IOW, hydrocarbons like elsewhere in the solar systems are here since the planet's birth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The earth was subjected to only a partial melt.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydrocarbons are stable to great depth.</strong>  High pressure greatly stabilizes hydrocarbons against thermal dissociation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rock at depth contains pores.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primordial hydrocarbons are still upwelling from the deep earth.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>some sub-points worthy of mention:</p>

<p>It more adequately explains why Helium is only present in the earth at any mine-able quantity in natural gas.   There are no pure Helium wells.  Why the strong association of hydrocarbons with Helium, an inert gas that can have no chemical interactions with fossil organic materials or with hydrocarbons?  This is known to geologists as the ""Petroleum Paradox"" and cannot be explained at all by a sedimentary origin of hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>The presently accepted theory of fossil fuels is that the hydrocarbons formed from the decayed remains of ancient organic matter (fossils) that somehow sank down into the deep earth and got trapped in sedimentary rock formations where increased pressures assisted in converting the organic material over time to hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Well, hydrocarbons are found in depths where no surface life remains could have possibly geologically submerged to.  The physics of how the ancient organic materials or the resulting hydrocarbons sank deep into the earth have yet to be explained.  Also, hydrocarbons have been found in igneous rock formations, which the accepted surface to sediment theory cannot explain.</p>

<p>Can we still say that fossil fuels are really from fossils?</p>

"How do glaciers move? Could Antarctica be separated?","<p>Consider the example of the Larsen Ice Shelf. Ice platforms are attached to glaciers such that they prevent surrounding warm air from directly melting the glaciers.  This is an important aspect of ice platforms. </p>

<p>What are the mechanisms of glacier movement?</p>

<p>When we talk about glacier movement, do we consider advance and retreat due to melting and snow deposition, or is the study of glacier movement more about the fluid sheet underneath the glacier that comes in contact with the rocks, which allows the glacier to move downhill?</p>

<p>With this second type of movement, glaciers can separate.  So is it possible for Antarctica to separate and disappear?</p>

"Post-stack seismic impedance (and amplitude) inversion confusion","<p>Yilmaz (2016) briefly explains - along with a nice accompanied image/diagram - the main categories of seismic inversion. He claims there are four: travel-time, waveform, hybrid, and join inversion. Now, I have heard the phrase ""amplitude inversion,"" too.</p>

<p>I am now left wondering what exactly is or what constitutes amplitude inversion...? Also, is impedance inversion a type of waveform inversion? Finally, is amplitude inversion also a type of waveform inversion. Obviously, I'm putting a lot in here, so I would greatly appreciate if someone could resolve my confusion.</p>

"Siberia (Beringia) during last glacier period","<p>Today, Northern Russia is considered quite cold. It is not populated because it has low biological productivity: low light and cold. It can be below -50 at winter and 10 C at summer peak. It is low populated because there is basically nothing to eat. Poor reindeers dig some moss from below the snow, which grows there a little during short summer period. </p>

<p>I am telling all of that, because I cannot even imagine what the hell Yakutiya would have been when all north of the continent was 1 km below the ice! Siberia stays permafrost even now, when you have warm summer days +5 Celsius. Certainly, it had to be frozen at glacier time permanently. Meantime, it is curious how people managed to cross the Bering Land Bridge during that latest glacier. How was that possible at that time, was it a Polar Voyage? </p>

<p>Now, I read that Yakutiya was <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328464.900-siberia-was-a-wildlife-refuge-in-the-last-ice-age.html#.VX8fMc9Viko"" rel=""noreferrer"">a wild life refugee during the last ice age</a>. It had much more rich wild life than now, comparative to what we have in Africa today. People appeared there 12 000 years ago, when half of the Great Glacier was melted</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLULa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and slaughtered mammoth. The mega-fauna extinction collapsed Siberian ecosystem, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene_Park"" rel=""noreferrer"">say scientists who undertake an attempt to recover it</a>. They tell that mammoth grazed grass. Did they procure it from below the snow, like reindeer do? Ok, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Beringia says that</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the ice ages, Beringia, like most of Siberia and all of north
  and northeast China, was not glaciated because snowfall was very
  light. It was a grassland steppe, including the land bridge, that
  stretched for hundreds of kilometres into the continents on either
  side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fine. But, the fact that all ice was concentrated over Europe and Canada does not mean that Beringia surface was not permanently frozen. If there is so cold that whole Europe is under 1 km of Ice, the cold Beringia must be frozen either, despite all ice is over Europe. We can have low temperatures without ice, right? And, if it was terribly cold in Europe, it must be at least that cold in Beringia, right? So, what could poor animals eat there, in the frozen desert?</p>

<p>To summarize, my question is: </p>

<p>How is this nonsense possible that the 'freezer' of our planet was flourishing, whereas the rest of the Planet was starving in frozen state during last glacier period? </p>

<p>PS! I was suggested to look at the <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Last_glacial_vegetation_map.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">climate zones during Last Glacier</a>. I have seen it but I cannot believe that northern Canada and Greenland was thriving forest whereas almost whole US was under permanent ice sheet. Similarly, we see that Tundra (current Eastern Siberia state) ruled in permafrozen Beijing whereas Eastern Siberia was enjoing same thriving steppe Forest that Alaska did</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q39ZY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>That is unbelievable and that is what I basically ask to explain. I guess that I have just mismapped the colors. There are too few colors. On the other hand, if anomaly did exist, I want to hear that explicitly, desirably with explanation. Is it really large animals who maintained the warmth at the very north (see ""Park"" above) before people exterminated them or what?</p>

<p>PS2 I have revised the <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Last_glacial_vegetation_map.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">climate zones map</a> and realized that we had Polar Desert in Siberia and Alaska rather than Forest Steppe. This makes more sense. But how did we had the large animals and thriving greenlands there anyway? Polar Desert is incompatible with green land, obviously. Polar Desert at zones map seems also to contradict the Beringia article, attributing Beringia to grassland steppe during Ice Age.</p>

"Intuitive definition of the Monin-Obukhov length?","<p>The <strong>Monin-Obukhov length</strong> (L) is defined as:</p>

<p>$$L = - \frac{\rho C_p T_v u^3_*}{kgH}$$</p>

<p>where $\rho$=moist air density; $C_p$=air specific heat capacity; $T_v$=virtual temperature; $u^3_*$=wind friction velocity; $k$=0.41 (von Karman constant); $g$=gravity; and $H$=sensible heat. Note that there are lots of different formulations - this one is taken from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6sJSDlDbE"">this video on eddy covariance</a>.</p>

<p>It is used when describing how turbulence is affected by bounancy, e.g. from rising thermals from the earth's surface. I would like to get some intuition for what the length actually physically represents. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monin%E2%80%93Obukhov_length"">wikipedia page</a> states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A physical interpretation of L is given by the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. During the day -L it is the height at which the buoyant production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, that is still pretty opaque to me. To me, that sounds something like a parameter of a distribution that describes at what height wind shear starts to break up up-welling packets of air, but I really don't have any idea. Is there a good intuitive description of this quantity?</p>

<p>I know that the tropics and Coriolis forces have something to do with the direction, and that wind flows from higher to lower pressure, but how can you guess what the pressure for an area will be for a certain season?</p>

"Why is the Sahara so much larger than the other horse latitude deserts?","<p>Every continent has a dry strip between about 15º and 35º on its west coast, but they vary drastically in size:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Baja/Mojave and Atacama are fairly narrow, stretching about 300 miles inland at the widest (using the ""25 cm annual precip"" definition of desert.</li>
<li>The Namib, about 600 miles.</li>
<li>The Great Australian Desert covers about 2,000 miles, most of the continent.</li>
<li>The Sahara, Arabian Desert, Dasht-e-Lut, and Baluchistan together stretch over 5,500!</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all caused by the winds of the horse latitudes, in turn caused by the continental high-pressure zones, AKA <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_ridge"" rel=""noreferrer"">subtropical ridges</a>.  But why does this produce just a slim strip of desert on some continents but a massive span southwest of Eurasia?</p>

<p>The size of the continent is the obvious answer, but if so why is Australia almost all desert, despite being the smallest continent, surrounded by warm ocean?  Looking at the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, the mountains of Iran, Angola, and Namibia, and the Great Dividing Range, it appears that each subtropical desert tends to end at a mountain range, but not always: the southern Namib climbs half a mile before stretching across half of South Africa, and the Sahara has several highlands.</p>

"Eliminating range folding error in doppler radar returns","<p>With weather radar, it's not uncommon to see large areas of the image blocked out due to detected range folding.  It's my understanding that this occurs when a reflection outside of range comes back after the next pulse has been transmitted, making the receiver think that a late reflection from the first pulse is actually for the second pulse and near by.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6CoU8.gif"" alt=""Range Folding""></p>

<p><em>Graphic Source:  <a href=""http://www.wdtb.noaa.gov/courses/dloc/topic3/lesson1/Section4/Section4-5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.wdtb.noaa.gov/courses/dloc/topic3/lesson1/Section4/Section4-5.html</a></em></p>

<p>It seems to me that it if we could differentiate between pulses, we could eliminate the possibility of range folding error.</p>

<h2>Frequency</h2>

<p>My first thought was that each pulse could be sent at different frequencies.  They would have to be close enough to not affect the amount of energy reflected, but far apart enough to be easily detected and not assumed to be part of doppler shift.  Even something as wide as 1MHz seems to fit this characteristic.  Is there a reason we don't use this method today?</p>

<h2>Polarization</h2>

<p>If we have to use the same frequency for both pulses, could we instead mount two antennas on the transmitting rig, one polarized clockwise and the other polarized counter-clockwise?  In this configuration, the exact same equipment could be used for transmitting with something that just switches between antennas for each pulse.</p>

<p>I'm curious if either method would work, and what the possible pitfalls are.</p>

<p>It seems that often the RMS amplitude is used instead.</p>

<p><strong>When do one use amplitude and when do one use RMS amplitude?</strong></p>

<p>When using RMS amplitude one must integrate over a window around the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>Which window do one use?</strong></p>

<p>I often see images of RMS amplitude maps where the caption simply says something like ""lower tertiary horizon with RMS amplitude extraction"".</p>

<p>Does this mean RMS calculated over a window from z =horizon - 10 m to horizon + 10 m for instance? </p>

<p>Or could it mean RMS calculated over a window from z = 3 peaks above horizon to 3 peaks below horizon? </p>

"Seismic dispersion: What does it really mean and what causes it?","<p>Body waves (to some extent) and especially surface waves show <em>dispersive</em> characteristics during propagation. In Dr. Christopher Liner's book [<em>Elements of Seismic Dispersion</em> (2012)], this phenomenon is quickly attributed to propagating seismic energy being <em>frequency-dependent</em>. I've heard this phrase for a long time, and I am still unsure how to visualize and/or quantify it for the sake of really understanding this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Indeed, why can't one phrase it as being <em>wavelength-dependent</em> as well? Also, for both surface and body waves, what are the primary factors that cause/generate seismic dispersion?</p>

"Internal energy, enthalpy, and work in the atmosphere","<p>I'm writing a toy radiative-convective atmospheric model and need to relate the heat flux convergences (either surface sensible heat flux or the radiative flux) to changes in atmospheric layer temperatures. The first law of thermodynamics states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied to the system plus the work done on the system by the surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is: Should gravitational potential energy be directly incorporated into this in any way, and where? When I calculate the internal energy of the layer, should that be just the thermodynamic internal energy $\rho c_v T$ or should it also include the potential energy $\rho g z$? The pressure work done on the system by its surroundings at the bottom of the layer is $p_{bot} \Delta z_{bot}$, which is clearly related to the raising and lowering of the layer. Should this work then be excluded from the RHS if the potential energy is excluded from the LHS?</p>

<p>I essentially have the following possibilities for calculating the change in temperatures:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} dz \, \rho c_v \Delta T = \Delta E_{rad}$</li>
<li>$\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} dz \, (\rho c_v \Delta T + \rho g z) = \Delta E_{rad}$</li>
<li>$\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} dz \, \rho c_v \Delta T = \Delta E_{rad} + p_{bot} \Delta z_{bot} - p_{top} \Delta z_{top}$</li>
<li>$\int_{z_{bot}}^{z_{top}} dz \, (\rho c_v \Delta T + \rho g z) = \Delta E_{rad} + p_{bot} \Delta z_{bot} - p_{top} \Delta z_{top}$</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like the first and last of these are equivalent (at least assuming hydrostatic balance), but the first would use the isochoric heat capacity and the last the isobaric heat capacity. I believe the last one is the correct choice but I feel very unsure about it. The same dilemma persists when a surface heat flux is applied, or convection changes the height of the upper atmosphere without changing any of its temperatures.</p>

<p>Relatedly, the full equation in a fluid dynamics point of view would include kinetic energy, and for an RCE model that would be turbulent kinetic energy. Should this be tracked? If I exclude it, is that the same as assuming that all kinetic energy gets turned into heat by viscosity between each timestep?</p>

<p>(These may be very basic questions to some of you, but for the life of me I can't convince myself of the right approach to take. I don't have any of my atmospheric science books with me, so if you throw in a reference, please make it to an online resource.)</p>

"Why is the bedrock buried so deeply in much of northern Minnesota?","<p>Although parts of northern Minnesota have bedrock exposed at the surface (especially in the Boundary Waters area and along the short of Lake Superior), the more usual situation here is for the bedrock to be buried very deeply indeed - with, in places, more than a hundred meters of soil overlying it, according to <a href=""https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/60080/umn22629%5b1%5d.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this map</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me; the whole area was buried under an ice sheet during the most recent glaciation, and the hundreds of meters of moving ice would have scraped everything down to bedrock (and scraped off large amounts of the bedrock itself) and prevented any new soil from forming until the ice sheet retreated.  Northern Minnesota has only been ice-sheet-free for a blink of an eye, geologically speaking - how did hundreds of meters of soil manage to form in such a short period of time?</p>

"Which particles are classified as PM2.5? How exactly is this defined?","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>When discussing ""PM2.5"", is there any standardized understanding of which particles are or are not included?</p>

<p>Is it everything that's 2.5 microns and smaller? Or Everything <em>between</em> 2.5 and 0.1 microns? </p>

<p>Likewise does PM10 include all of PM2.5?</p>

<p>And by what method is ""size"" specified? Is this an aerodynamic size from some kind of inertial impactor configuration (virtual or real), or an optical size from scattering, or something else?</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>PM2.5 and other classes of particulates are a ""hot topic"" now. From Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates#Size,_shape_and_solubility_matter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Particulates; size, shape and solubility matter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]The 10-micrometer size does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies. Because of their small size, <strong>particles on the order of 10 micrometers or less (coarse particulate matter, PM10)</strong> can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs such as the bronchioles or alveoli; when asthmatics are exposed to these conditions it can trigger bronchoconstriction.</p>
  
  <p>Similarly, so called fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (ultrafine particulate matter, PM0.1) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable particles penetrate no further than the bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM0.1, which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas exchange area, and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles. In analogy, the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract. The thoracic fraction is the fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung's airways. The respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions (alveoli).</p>
  
  <p>The smallest particles, less than 100 nanometers (nanoparticles), may be even more damaging to the cardiovascular system. Nanoparticles can pass through cell membranes and migrate into other organs, including the brain. Particles emitted from modern diesel engines (commonly referred to as Diesel Particulate Matter, or DPM) <strong>are typically in the size range of 100 nanometers (0.1 micrometer).</strong> [...]</p>

"How would plate tectonics differ if Earth had no water?","<p>Water plays a crucial role in plate tectonics by easing the brittle and ductile deformation of the Earth's lithosphere. Water lowers the Mohr-Coulomb for brittle fractures. During ductile deformation, it lubricates different deformational regimes. This is also important for the deformation in the asthenosphere.</p>

<p>In addition, water plays an important role in the formation of water-bearing minerals and the fluxing of melts, thereby substantially changing the rheology of the lithosphere and asthenosphere.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7YJ7.gif"" alt=""Water-bearing minerals of the mantle.""></p>

<p>So, what would plate tectonics look like on a waterless Earth? Would it even work? Would there be different rates, or totally different processes taking over, similar to what is seen on adjacent solar system bodies?</p>

"Will increased precipitation in Antarctica prevent sea level rise?","<p>It has been suggested that global warming will lead to increased precipitation in parts of Antarctica. This would sequester water in the ice sheet, preventing sea level rise.</p>

<p>However, the slope (and thus the height and volume) of continental ice sheets is limited by ice properties. What if the ice sheet is already at its maximum slope/height/volume (is this known)? Wouldn't adding more ice just cause more flow to the sea?</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~dmb53/DaveSTELLA/Glaciers/Ice%20Sheet%20Model.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">""Ice Sheet Modeling""</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ice behaves as a deformable plastic material, which means that there
  is a critical shear stress, below which no strain (deformation or
  flow) will occur ... If the slope is too low, the basal shear stress
  will not match the critical shear stress, ... but as snow piles up,
  ... flow will begin. ... The result of this is that a glacier has an
  equilibrium profile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am presuming that the ice sheets are already slightly above their equilibrium profile (since they are flowing). Since the profile depends on the area and shape of the base (which is shrinking due to melting around the edges), they are already holding as much ice as possible, and adding more snow to any region will just accelerate the flow. I don't know on what timescale this occurs. (I have not tried the computer models described in the paper.)</p>

"Evaporation loss formulas","<p>A while ago I created a spreadsheet to calculate evaporation loss. I found several formulas to do that, two from Kevin Rafferty and one from Engineering Toolbox. The one from Engineering Toolbox was too convoluted, and I couldn't figure out how to write it in Excel. The ones from Rafferty were fairly straightforward, but the two he published were different and yield different results. </p>

<p>The first is from Kevin Rafferty, P.E., Pond Heat Loss, 1986:  </p>

<p>$$ W_p=\frac{(1 + 0.225v)/0.018}{85.74 \times (T_s+460)} \times (P_w-P_a) \times 144 \times A $$</p>

<p>Where:  </p>

<ul>
<li>$W_p$ = Rate of evaporation in lbm/h  </li>
<li>$A$ = Pond surface area in ft$^2$</li>
<li>$v$ = Air velocity in ft/sec</li>
<li>$P_w$ = Saturation vapor pressure of pond water in psia</li>
<li>$P_a$ = Saturation pressure air dew point in psia</li>
<li>$T_s$ = Surface temperature °F</li>
</ul>

<p>The other is from Kevin Rafferty, P.E., Tonya Boyd, Aquaculture Information Package, 1998:  </p>

<p>$$ W_p=(0.097+0.38v) \times (P_w-P_a) \times A $$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$W_p$ = Rate of evaporation (lbm/h)</li>
<li>$A$ = Pond surface area (ft$^2$)</li>
<li>$v$ = Air velocity (mph)</li>
<li>$P_w$ = Saturation vapor pressure of pond water (psia)</li>
<li>$P_a$ = Saturation pressure at the air dew point (psia)</li>
</ul>

<p>$P_w$ is calculated by the formula</p>

<p>$$ P_w = 6.11 \times 10^\left({7.5T_s}/{237.3 + T_s)}\right) $$</p>

<p>$P_a$ is calculated by the same formula except that the dew point temperature in °F is used in place of $T_s$, so the pond surface temperature is used in both main formulas, except that in the second formula it is used to calculate the pond saturation vapor pressure.</p>

"Making sense of the math of climate change","<p>Let me state upfront, I'm not arguing the existence of climate change, just trying to clarify my own understanding of something that doesn't make sense to me yet. With apologies for the layman's question...</p>

<p>I've seen similar numbers frequently, but let's use <a href=""https://xkcd.com/1379/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this xkcd</a> 
as a reference. It states that a 4.5 C change in the global climate is the difference between Boston under a half mile of ice, and the temperate zone it is today.

<p>My brain says that a place covered by ice is far colder than current temps minus 4.5 C, and that since the ice sheets covered so much of the earth, I can safely skirt the ""climate is global, you're looking at local temps"" hangup. So what gives? <strong>How can a climate like Boston's cool by ""only"" 4.5 C and support such enormous glaciers?</strong> It would seem that the presence of such enormous ice sheets would imply that the average temperature must have been far colder than that...</p>

"Different atmospheric models available for personal usage?","<p>We are two high schoolers who would like to embark on a project to simulate the atmospheres of exoplanets.</p>

<p>More specifically, we would like to change the atmospheric composition of such planets. We have seen various climate models, such as CESM and PlaSim. Unfortunately, CESM appears to be quite complex, while the latter option doesn't have the resources we would need.</p>

<p>Are there any other simulators that may consistently do the same thing, but need lower computer specifications? Otherwise, are there any resources to become familiar with CESM at a high school level?</p>

<p>Furthermore, what would be the required specifications for running CESM on a fairly consistent basis? I have heard that you would need a cluster, but we currently do not have access to one. We may be able to rent one out, but we'd rather be familiar with CESM before we do.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>EDIT: (for clarification) I know a bit of FORTRAN, and have access to help from a Physics instructor. Although I understand that it may be out of the reach of two high school students, is there any sort of ""crash course"", one could recommend on more advanced astronomical physics?</p>

<p>Furthermore, we are interested in a rocky exoplanet, and potentially have access to a cluster/help from a professor.</p>

"How to calculate air temperature for given time, location and altitude?","<p>I would like to calculate (estimate) air temperature at given time, location and altitude.</p>

<p>All I have is air pressure for 20°C. The formula based on NTP (Normal Temperature and Pressure) to calculate pressure.</p>

<p>=101325*(1 - 2,25577*10^-5*h)^5,25588</p>

<p>h is height in meters` result is in Pascals.</p>

<p>I expect that the formula for calculation of the temperature would depend on sun position or even solar radiation. I know that the formulas for calculation of the sun position or solar radiation are complicated but maybe there are source codes/programs which can do that? So I could use such program to calculate what I need? I have found SolTrack (C/C++) on SourceForge which calculates various data like rise time, transit time, azimuth, altitude, ecliptic longitude, latitude, right ascension, declination... However I cannot use these results to calculate temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the calculation</strong></p>

<p>I would like to use the calculation for game, to generate air temperatures for map. The game is not simulator it is just game. So I need to add some values to the map so when the aircraft flies it can accept some temperature changes. The values are important in vicinity of terrain, mountains and hills. I don't need include winds into the calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation of Solar Radiation</strong>
What I have found so far is calculation of solar radiation written in Visual Basic - it is xls table (Excel) <a href=""http://ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/models/solrad.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/models/solrad.zip</a>. Where I have added the pressure for 20°C. Of sure the problem here is unsolved because I suppose the temperature and pressure changes during time. So I need to improve the formula to calculate the pressure for given location, time and altitude.</p>

"Should Imilac (meteorite) be singular or plural?","<p>I first saw the term ""Imilac meteorite"" in this <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40459602"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BBC News article</a>. It shows a photograph of a meteorite on display along with the caption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Imilac meteorite was found in the Atacama Desert in Chile in 1822.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then looked it up in Wikipedia's article <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imilac"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Imilac</a> and saw:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imilac is a pallasite meteorite found in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile in 1822.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these sound like there is one meteorite, and it's is called the Imilac meteorite.</p>

<p>But then the article goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Imilac is classified as a stony–iron pallasite. Imilac specimens are highly prized by meteorite collectors due to its high concentration of beautiful olivine grains.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Strewn field:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Numerous masses were found in a valley to the SW of Imilac. The total weight of the Imilac fall is estimated to be around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb). The primary strewn field is long about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be multiple, distinct specimens, and yet I don't see ""Imilac meteorites"" (plural) written here or anywhere. For example, in this British Natural History Museum article <a href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/imilac-meteorite-gem-as-old-solar-system.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Imilac meteorite: a gem as old as the solar system</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pallasite meteorites like the Imilac formed in the asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter. They are made up of minerals and metal, remnant materials from the first few million years of the solar system.</p>
  
  <p>They formed inside asteroids at a time when planets were only just coming together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are all of these Imilac specimens believed to be fragments of one single object that exploded before reaching the surface? If so, why not call them Imilac meteorites (plural) instead of talking about ""Imilac meteorite"" as a name for a material that is uncountable?</p>

"Coal self-heating and spontaneous combustion, how does this happen?","<p>I finally broke down and read the Wikipedia article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_combustion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spontaneous combustion</a> and I was surprised to see how serious of a problem this can be. Wet hay, oily rags, there really are exothermic reactions in these combinations that speed up as the temperature increases.</p>

<p>Then I saw the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coal</strong></p>
  
  <p>Self-heating in coal has been extensively studied. The tendency to self-heat decreases with increasing rank of the coal. Lignite coals are more active than bituminous coals, which are more active than anthracite coals. Freshly mined coal consumes oxygen more rapidly than weathered coal, and freshly mined coal self-heats to a greater extent than weathered coal. The presence of water vapor may also be important, as the rate of heat generation accompanying the absorption of water in dry coal from saturated air can be an order of magnitude or more than the same amount of dry air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that coal is a complex material, it's more than a lump of carbon. But what are the types of chemical reactions within coal that will cause a pile of it to self-ignite? Is moisture always required? Is there moisture in freshly mined coal naturally, or is it absorbed hygroscopically from the atmosphere or is a liquid source necessary (getting wet)?</p>

"The phase of a seismic source","<p>There are different seismic sources for both land and marine acquisition surveys. Measuring the spectral characteristics (phase, frequency, amplitude, etc.) is a critical part of evaluating the usefulness of the source and is quite difficult to measure accurately (especially on land). We always seek to generate an impulse (<em>or</em> a Dirac spike).    </p>

<p>All this said, my question is this: <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> do different frequencies retain various <strong>phase</strong> delays and <strong>amplitudes</strong>? Is this a phenomenon that does not occur the instantaneous moment the source is used...? I used Seismic Unix to generate the figure below - note that a phase diagram is not included here, but you already know that there some degree of phase delay/difference associated with each frequency (<strong>note</strong>: the horizontal axis is frequency and vertical is amplitude):</p>

<p>If my question seems vague, think of it this way. Let's say I (and my source) are in an infinite, elastic, and homogeneous medium. I set off my source (note that it is NOT a perfect impulse), and the result may look like what is pictured below. What causes frequencies to retain different amplitudes? What causes the phase delay associated with each frequency? I know I've included a lot here, regardless, any insight/comments are greatly appreciated.</p>

"Why are the latest additions to the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain the highest?","<p>The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain stretches from Russia to the Hawaiian islands.  When I look at them on a map, it seems that the oldest seamounts by Russia are shorter and smaller than the newer seamounts/islands, and even in the most recent additions (the Hawaiian islands) there seems to be a gradient in size, with the older islands being the smallest and the newest island by far the largest and with the tallest volcanoes.</p>

<p>Is this gradient in size due to erosion?  Were the seamounts at one point islands?  Or is there something related to the volcanic activity and plate motion itself that is producing larger volcanoes more recently?</p>

"How quickly can coral fossilize?","<p>On a trip to Honduras a few years ago I visited one of the islands off its north coast with a friend and went to a section of it mostly with nothing but residences which looked far less visited by tourists and which had no live coral off the coast in that section of island unlike other parts of it. While in that area we saw what looked like a rocky protrusion a little off from a small beach, about 50 or so yards offshore, so my friend and I waded out to it and we were stunned to discover that it was a rather large exposed section of coral that had been completely fossilized. It was pitted in parts, reminding me a bit of the surface of the moon, but we clearly saw amazing varieties of coral and their fossilized contours and patterns in the ""rock"". </p>

<p>But more puzzling is that it protruded at its base a good 1-2ft above sea level on average (though erosion made the edges gradually slope down to the water) and up to probably betweeb 5 to 7ft above sea level in some other areas where the coral [or mass it was on] protruded), which made the higher sections clearly higher than the beach we had just waded from. That seemed to indicate that the ocean level may have been quite a bit higher when it was still alive and parts of the island may have been more submerged at some point in the past if I had to guess. </p>

<p>Ignoring for a moment my imprecise measurements and notes about its exposure relative to sea-level, how long would it take any portion of alive and healthy coral to fossilize once exposed directly to the sun outside of/above water at its quickest, turning rock-grey and becoming firm, even if the fossilization process is not completed to its utmost extent? Can it happen in a few thousand years, or does it happen only at a significantly slower rate than that? Has any such process of fossilization actually been observed (as proceeding through its stages) at any point throughout recorded human history, and what would intermediate stages look like in terms of color, firmness, etc.? </p>

<p>I am not an earth scientist so you'll have to go easy on the explanation here.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I have now uploaded some <a href=""https://flic.kr/s/aHsmobvEPV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">photos to Flickr</a> of the particular coral I saw. The ""mini island"" (I'll call it) was quite alien-looking and bizarre in places, also overgrown with some plants on the main mass, but you can, for example, see the close up I took of one fossilized bit of brain coral that was firmly set in the rock.</p>

"Does the Coriolis Effect affect a wind from East to West?","<p>I'm studying meteorology for a pilot license and there I was taught as a rule of thumb that wind at higher altitudes is approximately turned 30° clockwise to the wind on the surface due to the Coriolis Effect.</p>

<p>The explanation I got is that if an air parcel moves e.g. towards the pole, it started with a higher velocity around the earth's axis than the destination point has, so it will arrive ahead of the destination point on the earth's surface.</p>

<p>While that totally makes sense for winds e.g. from south to north, or the other way round - why does the Coriolis effect also impact a wind that's blowing exactly from East to West? Shouldn't the origin and the destination of that wind have the same speed around earth's axis and therefore no Coriolis force should act on the wind?</p>

"Debunking weather conspiracy with statistics - why does temperature rise then fall for last weekend in June in recent years","<p>I have a conspiracy-prone friend who believes that people are controlling the weather to ensure good weather for a large, annual festival (last weekend in June in San Francisco). As a scientist, (not earth science), I was interested in testing this hypothesis. So..I built 2 linear models--one representing the days leading up to the festival, one representing the days following the festival-- where the I regressed max daily temperature onto the number of days away from the festival. Lo and behold, indeed the temperature did appear to rise, peak on the weekend of the festival, and then drop afterwards! Next I figured, it must just be a natural trend, irrespective of local festivities (and weather-controlling overlords). So next, I included data from the years before the festival began (1972), made two groups (pre-festival and post-festival) and included a days_away_from_festival*group interaction term. To my great surprise, the interaction was significant! Testing only the group dated before the festival began, did not yield significant results.</p>

<p>And so! My question is... can any of you experts explain this by means other than a statistical coincidence/wealthy weather gods? Why might the temperature in San Francisco tend to rise in the week leading up to the last weekend in June, and then fall afterwards--but for this effect not to be present in the years before 1970'sish?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here are my two models. </p>

<p>The first model represents the days leading up to the festival and days are indicated by the countdown variable, (e.g. Friday = -1, Saturday = 0) There are 5 days prior included in the model. The group variable refers to the fact that I split the years into two groups, old:(1942-1971) and new:(1972-2017). TMAX is the maximum temperature of the day.</p>

"What happens in the upper air when the altitude of the tropopause changes?","<p>I know about the seasonal changes of the altitude of the tropopause as well as the differences by latitude. I thought the change at one location was a very slow process, but I just found <a href=""http://en.vedur.is/weather/aviation/upper-air-observations/"" rel=""noreferrer"">upper air observations through radiosounding</a> from Iceland where I could see that the altitude of the tropopause changes up to 7000ft (over 2km) within 12 hours, such as:</p>

<p>What exactly happens in the atmosphere when the altitude of the tropopause changes that rapidly? Is air moving horizontally? Vertically? Is air exchanging heat energy with surrounding air? My best guess would now be that since the polar jet stream is above Iceland, it transports vast amounts of air, so an observer in Iceland each day sees different atmospheric conditions when looking upwards. How close to reality is that guess?</p>

<p>My first attempt at setting up an FEM following the same logic as LIM3's finite difference formulation resulted in an underdetermined system by 1 equation. I then realized that the model allows density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity to be discontinuous between snow and ice (obviously) but the temperature was continuous. I get that the conductive heat flux has to be continuous, but is the temperature? If not, where might an additional constraint for heat diffusion come from? I can describe my FEM in more detail if that helps, but that might be better suited to a different SE.</p>

"Modification of an air mass","<p>If an air mass that exists in North America starts moving south west or south east what kind of modification will affect it and how would you characterize it in it's final state?</p>

<p>My answer is that it would be a cP or an A air mass that would start moving so firstly it would be dry,cold and stable.During it's south movement it's temperature would decrease because of the latitude and also if it moves over any major lakes it would pick up some moisture.My problem is what happens when it reaches the Pacific ocean or the Atlantic ocean.I know it's moisture would increase but do I need to know if it's winter or summer to conclude if it's stable/unstable and cold/warm?</p>

"How can linear oceanic ridges (like the East Pacific Rise) be explained by single point mantle plumes?","<p>I'm a bit confused about how divergent boundaries between tectonic plates work, or just why plates move. I've read that these ridges that are in the place of divergent boundaries are created when magma arises from the mantle convection, probably powered by a mantle plume. This creates a hotspot, but in every illustration I have seen, they use these plumes or just the mantle convection force to explain why plates move apart each other:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYc5h.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYc5h.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here, that convection of the mantle is used to explain the formation of a ridge and why the plates move apart.</p>

<p>However, this is easy to understand with a cross section of the Earth like in that picture. But I can't wrap my head around the idea of this phenomenon creating the linear ridges we see extending across thousands of kilometers, like the East Pacific Rise. Because, that ""ridge"" we see in the above picture is just an elevation seen in a cross section of the Earth, that could very well be just a volcano or a single oceanic mountain, not a linear ridge of continental dimensions.</p>

<p>I mean this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIvlL.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIvlL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>That can't be produced by a single mantle plume, right? Because a mantle plume is just in one spot. Is the convection force of the mantle rising across that entire line that is kilometers wide, creating a linear mantle plume? If that last one is the case, I would be even more confused about the shape of the convection cells in the mantle. Or are there multiple individual mantle plumes conveniently aligned across and beneath that ridge?</p>

<p>So, I don't understand how the ridge is formed. Because the first picture helps me only to understand how a single elevation spot is created, like an underwater mountain, or a volcano, or even a volcanic island, but not an entire ridge.</p>

<p>Now, I do know that the chain of Hawaiian islands up to Siberia was created due to the tectonic plate passing above a plume, or just a hotspot, and that created the entire ""ridge"". But are all oceanic ridges formed in that same way? Due to a single plume creating a hotspot and the plate moving above it drawing the ridge as it passes? Or is this a different process? Because I also know this is happening in the middle of a plate, not a divergent boundary</p>

<p>This is a picture about the Hawaiian island formation I read:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$v_g = \frac{g_0}{f} \cdot \frac{1}{r \cdot cos(\phi)} \cdot \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda}$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\phi, \lambda$</span> are the latitude and longitude respectively,  <span class=""math-container"">$u, v$</span> is the zonal and meridional components respectively, <span class=""math-container"">$f$</span> is the Corlilios parameter, <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span> is the mean radius of the Earth, and <span class=""math-container"">$\Phi$</span> is geopotential height.</p>

<p>My question is primarily concerned with the calculation of geopotential height. Based on my understanding thus far, geopotential is calculated using this equation:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$|\nabla \Phi| \approx 9.80665 + (1 - 0.00259 \cdot cos(\phi)(1 - 3.14 \times10 ^ {7} z) $</span> </p>

  <p>Note: <span class=""math-container"">$|\nabla \Phi|$</span> is the local gravitational constant. It is sometimes I believe represented as <span class=""math-container"">$g_A$</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which plugs into the equation for geopotential height below, where <span class=""math-container"">$g_o$</span> is the standard gravity at mean sea level:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\Phi = \frac{|\nabla \Phi|}{g_o}$</span></p>

<p>I think this works fine for the zonal component, however, it results (again I think) in an output of 0 for the meridional component. This cannot be true, can it? Am I missing something crucial?</p>

<p>I do know one extra piece of information. Under the continuity equation:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{\partial u_g}{\partial \phi} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial \lambda} = 0$</span></p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{\partial u_g}{\partial \phi} = -\frac{\partial v_g}{\partial \lambda}$</span> </p>

<p>In short, I am looking for an equation that considers latitudinal and longitudinal variation in acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p>I am extremely new (complete newb) to the world of atmospheric science/dynamics, so, any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  </p>

"Near-Surface Investigations: FWI vs. MASW","<p>MASW is a common processing method for civil/geotechnical and even for oil/gas exploration (usually weathering static corrections) applications.

"Travel Times for Seismic Wave Types - Why reflected t-x plot curves","<p>I do not understand how the reflected wave in a seismic survey has a steepening slope (slows down)  Please bear with me as I lay out my thoughts because I feel like I can grasp all of this except this one thing and I am struggling to reconcile it. </p>

<p>If a wave source produces waves at a point, as in a seismic geophysical survey there are 3 types of waves which we consider. There is the direct wave, the reflected wave, and the refracted wave. The reflected wave is never a first arrival. The refracted wave is first lagging behind the direct wave before reaching it at the crossover point and overtaking it. This makes sense because the refracted wave has a higher speed but it does not register its propagation at the first geophone until a certain time has elapsed since the initial pulse at the wave source; and the direct wave has been traveling from the source all the while. </p>

<p>On an arrival time plot where time is the vertical y-axis and where distance is the horizontal x-axis we see that the refracted wave has an unphysical beginning at the y intercept and the direct wave begins normally from the origin. Where the intersect the refracted wave overtakes the direct wave. On this type of diagram the smaller the slope, the faster the wave. The slope of the refracted wave is 1/v2 and the slope of the direct wave is simply 1/v1.   </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iefet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iefet.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I do not understand is why the reflected wave has a hyperbolic or curved trajectory on this plot. The slope steepens as it asymptotically approaches the direct wave. It makes sense that over long distances that the direct wave and the reflected wave should merge to almost being indistinguishable, but how is it possible that the reflected wave plot as a steepening slope i.e. is slowing down?  The reflected wave travels less  surface distance per unit time the smaller its angle of incidence ( meaning closer to the source) because it is more vertical than horizontal. Over time it becomes more horizontal and therefore more like a direct wave which takes a shorter and quicker path across the surface.  What am I missing? Why does the reflection plot curve as it does?</p>

"Does tropical rain forest as defined by the Holdridge Life Zone classification exist in any meaningful prevalence?","<p>I've been recently introduced to the Holdridge life zones and their method of classification, and have been somewhat concerned/confused by the definitions of tropical rain forest as described by the system.</p>

<p>From looking at the zone of tropical rain forest, as opposed to subtropical rain forest or tropical wet forest, the minimum annual precipitation for the category appears to be 8000mm/8m. However, I've also found a number of mentions that the Holdridge system considers a ""true tropical rainforest"" to have annual temperatures over 24 degrees Celsius and annual rainfall higher than only 2000mm/2m.</p>

<p>The former threshold seems extremely high - very, very few places on Earth, even looking specifically within regions in the Amazon or SE Asia, appear to experience 8000mm or more of annual rainfall. However, an area with above 24 degrees annual temperature and between 2000mm and 4000mm of annual rainfall would appear to be considered a ""tropical moist forest"" and between 4000mm and 80000mm a ""tropical wet forest"", separate categories from the ""tropical rain forest"".</p>

<p>This seems like a very simple definitional question, but I've been unable to find a clear, solid answer on it. Thus:</p>

<p>What would happen? First of all, how far could you realistically even take this: Would it be possible with the used process to go all the way down to 0 atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (or at least approach this arbitrarily closely)? And what effects would this have on the environment?</p>

<p>I immediately had three ideas that could happen but I wonder how realistic those would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Average temperatures would drop (inverse Greenhouse effect) (but how far?)</li>
<li>Plants would eventually be unable to produce sugar through photosynthesis and die off</li>
<li>Instead of acidifying, oceans would become increasingly alkaline. Lime might drop out of the oceans rapidly which could, perhaps, have cancer-like effects on coral reefs and anything that heavily depends on lime.</li>
</ul>

<p>And besides those, are there any other obvious notable effects?</p>

Most large peninsula on Earth are oriented southwards (and most of the rest northwards), much fewer east or west. Some examples:
Florida, Californa peninsula, Yucatan, South America, Antarctic peninsula, India, Kamtjatka, Korea, Malaysia, Scandinavia, Italy, Greece, Greenland. Contrary examples would be east Siberia, Kola, Turkey. (Is it just me, or have this question ever been raised before in history?)</p>

<p>Is this just coincidence, or could conceivably some tectonic, gravitational or rotational forces help cause this phenomena?

"What are the physical upper bounds on the magnitude of an earthquake?","<p>Given what we know about the physical mechanisms underlying earthquakes, what do the theoretical upper bounds on the magnitude of an earthquake look like? What physical phenomena impose those upper bounds? </p>

<p>Assume that we're talking about the ""modern"" Earth, i.e. from the past 4 billion years, after the Earth was fully formed. Also assume that only natural phenomena are involved - no nuclear weapons or <a href=""http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Deep_Child"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deep Children</a> or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>If it makes a difference, I would like to know what the answer looks like in two cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>No impact events are involved - the earthquake is generated by purely terrestrial phenomena</li>
<li>Arbitrarily large impact events are involved, provided that the Earth still looks ""roughly the same"" (defined however makes sense to you) after the impact</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a trivial upper bound of moment magnitude ~25 for the former case, since the energy released by a magnitude-25 earthquake is roughly equal to the total mass-energy of the Earth<sup>1</sup> - but I'm sure you folks know of tighter bounds than that. :)</p>

<p>(cf. the question <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/875/are-richter-magnitude-10-earthquakes-possible"">Are Richter-magnitude 10 earthquakes possible?</a> - but most of the answers there are from a statistical perspective, not a physical perspective.)</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><sup>1</sup> As we know, the total mass-energy content of a system is given by </p>

<p>$$E = \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2}$$</p>

<p>Since the Earth's motion (both translational and rotational) is non-relativistic, we discard the momentum term as negligible and simply write $E = m_\text{Earth}c^2$. Using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_of_Earth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$m_\text{Earth} = 6 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{kg}$</a>, this gives us $E = 5 \times 10^{41}\ \mathrm{J}$.

  <p>Ocean acidification is different than sea level rise and global warming, however. With ocean acidification, we're making an excursion unlike anything the planet has seen in 300 million years.

As far as we know, this level of OA could produce a full trophic collapse -- and that isn't something that even I can't be cavalier about, as it would certainly be a civilisation-limiting (and possibly complex-life-limiting) event. Until we know for certain that the impacts of OA will be less severe than this, we should be doing everything we can to stop and reverse it.</p>

It seems very surprising that there's a route from some random spot near Lake Baikal over 2,800 miles or so to the Arctic Ocean, which is downhill all the way. Likewise, the Missouri River tells us that there's an even longer downhill-only route from some place in Montana to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>But these things certainly do exist and it's a pattern repeated all over the world: the great majority of the Earth's surface is drained by rivers that run downhill to the sea. They don't get stuck and they don't seem to form huge numbers of lakes where they have to flood an area to raise the water level over some barrier. I'm aware of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">endorheic basins</a>, which don't drain to the ocean but they only cover about 18% of the land surface, mostly in central Asia.</p>

  His findings: about 40 per cent have actually grown in size. Another 40 per cent stayed stable, and just 20 per cent have shrunk.<br />

<p>As far as I know, sea level rise is going to be much faster than coral can grow, plus we have the complication factor of reduced grow (or actual coral death) because of rising sea water acidity and temperature.</p>

<p>But it's still an intriguing question: <strong>Could there be a hint of truth in this, that coral growth could keep up with sea level rise?</strong><br />
Maybe with a little help from us?<br />
Has this been investigated?</p>

"Deadly minerals","<p>I would like to go into mineral excavation as a hobby. What deters me is the fact there are quite a few deadly minerals/ores out there. My question is how likely is it there are those deadly ores in landlocked countries on Balkan peninsula? I know there are some cinnabar findings near me but other deadly minerals are usually found near volcanic vents and other geological formations not characteristic to Balkan peninsula. In statistical terms, how likely is it I will come across those nasty things here?</p>

"Dig in the rationality of model evaluation of WRF with land-based station data","<p>I use WRF (Weather research and forecasting) model for in regional scale meteorology simulation. And then, the WRF output files will be deemed as criterial input data applying for chemical transport model(e.g CMAQ, CAMx).       </p>

<p>The meteorology information are very important for chemical species in the atmosphere. It will influence its emission, diffusion, transportation and removal process and thereby determine the distribution of chemical in horizontal and vertical scales(healthy effect and climate effect related). </p>

<p>Since the importance of meteorology mode output data, the model evaluation process is essential before applying WRF output file for further use.  </p>

<p>Several papers I have read mainly has the similar method that introducing some land-based station data(e.g <a href=""http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">NCDC</a>) within the simulation area and compare them using statistic method. </p>

<p>Usually, we use point-to-point statistic metrics to estimate the similarity of observed data and simulation data in nearest grid in value(<em>MB, RMSE, NMB, NME</em>) and temporal variation(<em>R</em>). </p>

<h3>But I have some <strong>doubt</strong> here</h3>

<p>(1) The land-based data is the physics parameters collected from one specific spot and the corresponding WRF output grid data is the average value of the whole area(e.g 9 km^2). They represent the meteorology condition in different scale. What's more, if the station spot is near or at the boundary of grid system, how do we choose the best grid indices?   </p>

<p>(2) We always regard the land-based observation data as 'true' value. But the instruments also have its own errors. If the observed data has large bias with 'true' physics process, it should be considered as useless. How do we evaluate the observed data itself and analysis it with certain uncertainty?  </p>

<p>(3) More detailly, the WRF output data 2-m temperature(RH) and 10-m wind direction/wind are directly used for point-to-point difference. Does it reasonable to compare in these altitude or the value has little difference in several meters range.</p>

<p>I think this problem not just exist in WRF model. The air quality model evaluation may has the same issue when comparing simulated value with observed concentration. Is there any more advanced method?  </p>

<p>Any one has some thought about this question can share your valuable opinion here!</p>

"Formula for numerical model for sustained warming in marine sediment?","<p>I have been reading <a href=""http://pm22100.net/docs/pdf/enercoop/energie/gaz/130316_Methane_Hydrates_and_Contemporary_Climate_Change.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> and found simple numerical formulations to model the time duration, affected depth and amount of warming of marine sediments. The author uses a rudimentary estimate of the depth to which sediments are affected by an instantaneous, sustained temperature change DT in the overlying air or ocean waters that can be made using the diffusive length scale:</p>

<pre><code>1 = √kt    (1)
</code></pre>

<p>which describes the depth (m) that 0.5 DT will propagate in elapsed time t (s). k denotes thermal diffusivity, which ranges from ~0.6
to 1x10-6 m2/s for unconsolidated sediments.</p>

<p>For instance, it is said that over 10, 100, and 1000 yr, the calculation yields
maximum of 18 m, 56 m, and 178 m, respectively, regardless of the magnitude of DT. However, in page 6 (section 3), it is said that using a DT=1.25ºC (plus some other assumptions) during 100 yr of sustained warming affects a depth of ~40 m. How about if just DT is changed to 4ºC? deeper than 40 m in the same 100 yr?</p>

<p>I understand that (1) can be used to estimate both the time of the sustained warming and the affected depth. However, this formula does not provide a way to define the amount of warming or to estimate how much warming was applied if time and depth are known. Is there a formula for the amount of warming that complements (1)?</p>

"Ocean level rising, or the floor getting higher?","<p>I randomly had a question pop into my head: ""Why are oceans salty, but rivers are not?""</p>

<p>This article seems to provide a plausible explanation: <a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/riversnotsalty.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/riversnotsalty.html</a></p>

<p>It basically says:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rain keeps putting fresh water into the rivers, which is why they aren't ""salty"".</li>
<li>Rivers, as they flow, pick up sediment from the earth and push that into the oceans.  It's more or less this sediment that makes the oceans taste ""salty"".</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>That leads me to my question:</strong>  Is the ocean really ""rising"", or is the floor just getting ""thicker/higher"".  The article states that millions of tons of sediment is being deposited on the ocean floor every year.  Most people say/believe that melting ice is causing the ocean level to rise.  I'm not trying to counter that, but couldn't all that sediment be a significant factor as well?  i.e. Maybe the ocean level isn't ""rising"" as much as we believe, but, rather, the water is getting displaced by all that sediment?</p>

The thirs photo - there is a lenticular cloud on the left. On the right there is.. I dont know. I would not say it is a pileus cloud.</p>

<p>According to definitions, there is no strict difference between pileus and velum. I am fine with it. I have seen some pileus clouds and those are often very thin, sometimes multi-layered. Velum is, in fact, a large (horizontaly expanded) pileus. I am fine with it. But, according to some definitions, it would be classified as altocumulus / altostratus, if there were no connections to the cumulus top. That makes me confused. I have seen many ""pileus"" clouds that were not tha classic, pileus. Those looked like altocumulus lenticularis AND isolated Ac len were present on the sky in these situations. Definition of altocumulus lenticularis doesn´t say anything about connection with low level clouds, though.</p>

<p>A situation I came across many times.. the sky is full of isolated cumulus mediocris clouds &amp; altocumulus lenticularis clouds. Ac len are supposed to form above terrain elevations, but I believe that there is a mechanism which allows them to grow above cumulus clouds. I have seen many photos all over the world showing a typical cumulus mediocris connected with a relatively large altocumulus. Like this one:</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of figure 3, including a cropped subsection. If you open the figure in a new window you can view it at full size. In the subsection there are two rectangles with the word CONE above them. Below these words there are two traces. If I understand correctly, the lower trace is (for lack of better vocabulary) the surface of the Earth, and those cones have been identified as volcanos. However I believe the upper trace is the top of a layer of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tephra</a>:.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tephra</strong> is fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size or emplacement mechanism.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g2AvM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></p>
  
  <p>Volcanologists also refer to airborne fragments as <strong>pyroclasts</strong>. Once clasts have fallen to the ground they remain as tephra unless hot enough to fuse together into pyroclastic rock or tuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm trying to understand what might have happened here. the two cones are of the order of 10 km apart, and they extend above and below sea level. Was there an eruption below the ice which acted as a buffer and contained the ejecta? With some melting, some water below the ice could help it to flow over time and redistribute more evenly between the cones. Or would these volcanos just blow the ice away completely for an extended period of time and Southern Ocean currents could assist in the redistribution?</p>

"What would be the depth variation of a ""water ellipsoid"" above a reference ellipsoid Earth?","<p>The question <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/q/7446/6031"">If the Earth was a smooth spheroid how deep would be the ocean?</a> has an <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/7448/6031"">excellent answer</a> which explains the shape and surface area of an oblate spheroid before calculating the average depth of the Earth's surface water (about 2.7 km). The difference in radius, and surface area compared to a sphere look to be of the order of parts-per-thousand compared to a sphere.</p>

<p>But even within the approximation of an ellipsoid, the Earth's gravity is not uniform in direction nor magnitude, and so the assumption of a constant water depth from pole to equator may also require some correction of the order of parts-per-thousand.</p>

<p>How would one calculate the variation of depth of the water from pole to equator taking into account some kind of first order variation of gravitational force and rotational effects (centrifugal force) to get the shape of the ""water ellipsoid""? Does it turn out that the thickness would end up being uniform because the Earth ellipsoid is already a response to rotational effects, or would there be a pole-to-equator variation in depth of order parts-per-thousand?</p>

"Could the earth be much older than the currently accepted number?","<p>According to wikipedia, the Earth is about 4.543 billion years old. If I understand correctly, this number is based on radiometric age-dating of meteorites. So basically, the logic is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>We've got this material</li>
<li>We can show that it's about 4.543 billion years old</li>
<li>We haven't found anything older.</li>
<li>Therefore this is probably about the age of the Earth</li>
</ol>

<p>However inference 4 seems a bit problematic. How do we know that the Earth isn't significantly older? Could it be 5 billion years old? Could it be 8? Discounting the big bang theory, could it be 13 or even 15 billion years old, using only what we know about the science of the Earth?</p>

"Plate Tectonics vs Gravity for Creating Highs and Lows","<p>I have a question that I thought of when discussing a Worldbuilding scenario <a href=""https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/118953/how-would-coral-reefs-thrive-on-this-super-earth-world?noredirect=1#comment366364_118953"">here</a>. In that question, a super earth with gravity 1.35 times that of earth's is discussed, and is assumed to have shallow oceans. It is the assumed cause of these shallow oceans that got me thinking. </p>

<p>The question supposes that the shallow oceans are a result of a crust more uniform than that of earth, i.e without significant variations in depth, and that said uniformity is caused by gravity evening things out somehow. However, the imaginary world is also said to have more volcanic activity than earth, which I interpret to mean at least some tectonic activity.</p>

<p>My first thought was that there is no reason for gravity, at the scale we are discussing, to influence the uniformity of a planet's crust after its formation, and that plate tectonics would play a much larger role. I suppose the crust would be a bit denser depending on its original composition, and perhaps the <strong>magnitude</strong> of gravity influences the tectonics themselves more significantly than I realize. (Obviously with no gravity, there are no plate tectonics, and in fact no planet, so that's not what I'm after).</p>

<p><strong>Earth Science Questions:</strong> What effects, if any, does gravity have on the mountains and depths of earth's crust? Assuming earth-like dynamics at play, would plate tectonics have more of an influence on the formation of a planet's crust's highs and lows than gravity? If not, why?</p>

"In hydraulic fracturing, can total oil/gas production be broken down by stage?","<p>I have a hydraulic fracturing data set with some wells and each well is broken up into stages. My response is total well production and my goal is to be able to predict this total well production. The number of wells is extremely low (&lt;10) for any prediction task though but there are many stages per well and each stage has a rich feature set. To synthetically increase my number of observations I want to try to derive a per stage production that is a little smarter than simply dividing the total well production by number of stages. I am thinking of using Gibbs Sampling to produce observations of stage production using the total well production and stage features as givens and a mild assumption of what the covariance matrix would look like.

"Intuition on overall effects from climate change under different levels of warming","<p>I am not a climate scientist, but I have been reading climate literature lately for my own education. Much of it discusses various effects that could be expected with different levels of warming, usually by 2050 or 2100, e.g. reductions in crop yield, flooding, etc. However, I find it very difficult to intuit what the effects of various scenarios would mean in aggregate. E.g. say we have 4 C warming by 2100. What is the overall level of economic damage globally? Even better, what is a way to get a grasp on the level of damage or suffering that results - is it a societal collapse, or something similar to WWII, or something similar to the Great Depression, or something much less?</p>

<p>Are there any good resources or papers that discuss overall (net amount of damage, net amount of suffering) range of possible effects in an intentionally intuitive manner like this, for different warming scenarios?</p>

<p>Note that I am not looking for predictions of temperature rise. Ideally, I am looking for predictions of damage that are stated in a way that is easy to get an intuitive global handle on, <i>given</i> specified temperature rises, by specified years (e.g., presumably 1 C by 2030 would cause more damage than 1 C by 2050 or even 2100).</p>

<p>The closest thing that I have found to this so far are the burning ember diagram in the IPCC reports, and the corresponding referenced papers. This is a step in the right direction as far as what I am looking for, and gives some references that may be helpful (I haven't explored them yet), but still doesn't quite hit the mark for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, this might be a broad and strange question, but an answer or partial answer to it would help me greatly to contextualize the subject as I study it.</p>

  <p>This is the Kola Superdeep Borehole, the deepest manmade hole on Earth and deepest artificial point on Earth. The 40,230ft-deep (12.2km) construction is so deep that locals swear you can hear the screams of souls tortured in hell. It took the Soviets almost 20 years to drill this far, but the drill bit was still only about one-third of the way through the crust to the Earth’s mantle when the project came grinding to a halt in the chaos of post-Soviet Russia.</p>

"How does multiple layer seismic reflection work? How do we distinguish arrivals from different layers and their velocities?","<p>Whenever we are investigating multiple layer interfaces in a seismic reflection survey the root-mean-squared velocity is often employed to deduce travel time to a certain n-th layer and also to deduce velocity of any given interval. This is done because it is a way to account for refraction that is also occurring between layers which alters the reflection of a shot made through multiple layers. </p>

<p>What I don't understand is how do we know the travel times in any layer beforehand? How are we distinguishing between different travel times and assigning them to different layers we've distinguished? We need travel times of successive layers in order to compute the root-mean-square, but this is puzzling to me because how could you already know them?  Who is to say it is multiple and not just 1? or 3, or 5 or some arbitrary number? What about the arrivals to the geophones tell us this?</p>

<p>I don't get how we know there are extra layers in the first place to which we must assign travel times, and when they do exist, from where do these travel times come?  I have included a graphic to help show what I mean. The more I think about this, the more I start to think I don't understand multiple layer seismic reflection in general. </p>

"What exactly is ammonite?","<p>I miss the definition of <strong>ammonite</strong>. In my opinion, many authors confuse the term ""<strong>Ammonite</strong>"" and ""Ammonoid"". Ammonoids (Ammonoidea) are large group of cephalopods including for example goniatites (Goniatitida), ceratites (Ceratitida) and <strong>ammonites</strong> (<strong>Ammonitida?</strong>). </p>

<p>EDIT: If you think that ammonites and ammonoids are the same, you are not right. Notice that researchers try to avoid using the term ammonite when talking about paleozoic ammonoids. Ammonites are usually refered to jurassic and cretaceous ammonoids.

<p>Can we call all jurassic and cretaceous ammonoids (phylloceratina, psiloceratina, lytoceratina, ammonitina, haploceratina, perisphinctina and ancyloceratina) <strong>ammonites</strong>? Can you show me where ammonites are on phylogenetic tree?</p>

"How to improve this prediction about the climate in future?","<p>The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the more global warming.

<p>Sooner or later the cloud formations will reach a point of equilibrium when global warming cease in a state of much more clouds, much more and stronger storms. When global cooling and decrease of carbon dioxide, the glaciation will increase the albedo and support the global cooling with amplifying feedback, as atmospheric carbon dioxid support global warming with amplifying feedback.</p>

<p>This seems to be in accordance with the historical peaks of temperature anomalies and carbon dioxide rates. The question is, does this mechanism works in the industrial era? Will the storms, if necessary, stop the extra  emissions of carbon dioxide? If human being isn't able to cut it down?</p>

"Decomposition of variables in horizontal and vertical modes","<p>I have a query regarding the practical applicability of variable separable method. Usually we decompose the variables w.r.t components corresponding to different dimensions, this method is used to solve a differential equation analytically. When it comes to the practical usage, we are often provided already with the solution in form of model output. Is it possible to decompose them along their dimensions? For example I can write the zonal velocity as</p>

<pre><code>              U(x, y, z, t) = uv(z) * uh(x,  y,  t)
</code></pre>

<p>Will this decomposition be unique? I am clueless because it just seems to be a matrix multiplication. I wonder how would be the form of those matrices. Is it possible to obtain uv and uh from the data variable using any software tool? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> An example of such a decomposition is provided <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268301695_Reconsidering_the_role_of_Rossby_waves_in_the_Madden-Julian_Oscillation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> at page number 7 (equation 2.6).

"What are ""young thrust faults"" and why are they significant on the Moon?","<p>The abstract of the new Nature Geoscience paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0362-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shallow seismic activity and young thrust faults on the Moon</a> reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The discovery of young thrust faults on the Moon is evidence of recent tectonic activity, but how recent is unknown.</strong> Seismometers at four Apollo landing sites recorded 28 shallow moonquakes between 1969 and 1977. Some of these shallow quakes could be associated with activity on the young faults. However, the epicentre locations of these quakes are poorly constrained. Here we present more-accurate estimates of the epicentre locations, based on an algorithm for sparse seismic networks. We found that the epicentres of eight near-surface quakes fall within 30 km of a fault scarp, the distance of the expected strong ground shaking. From an analysis of the timing of these eight events, we found that six occurred when the Moon was less than 15,000 km from the apogee distance. Analytical modelling of tidal forces that contribute to the current lunar stress state indicates that seven near-apogee events within 60 km of a fault scarp occur at or near the time of peak compressional stresses, when fault slip events are most likely. <strong>We conclude that the proximity of moonquakes to the young thrust faults together with evidence of regolith disturbance and boulder movements on and near the fault scarps strongly suggest the Moon is tectonically active.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd like to understand what young thrust faults are, how one can decide that there is a fault on the Moon (apart from the ""evidence of regolith disturbance and boulder movements on and near the fault scarps""), that it is a <em>thrust fault</em> and that it is <em>young</em>, and why this specific kind of fault is so significant here.</p>

<h2>PROJECT MOGUL</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project MOGUL was first conceived by Dr. Maurice Ewing of Columbia University, NY, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, MA. Dr. Ewing had conducted considerable research for the Navy during World War II, studying, among other things, the ""sound channel"" in the ocean. He proved that explosions could be heard thousands of miles away with underwater microphones placed at a predetermined depth within the sound channel. He theorized that since sound waves generated by explosions could be carried by currents deep within the ocean, they might be similarly transmitted within a sound channel in the upper atmosphere. The military application of this theory was the long-range detection of sound waves generated by Soviet nuclear detonations and the acoustical signatures of ballistic missiles as they traversed the upper atmosphere. He presented his theory to General Carl Spaatz, Chief of Staff of the Army Air Forces, in the fall Of 1945. ...</p>
  
  <p>...By December 1948, serious concerns had arisen regarding the feasibility of the project as first conceived. Even though the principle on which the project was based was determined to be sound, questions concerning cost, security, and practicality were discussed-that ultimately led to the disbandment of the project, and Project MOGUL as first conceived was never put into operational use. ...</p>
  
  <p>...The primary scientist for MOGUL was Dr. James Peoples, assisted by Albert P. Crary, the Field Operations Director. Both scientists had previous associations with Dr. Ewing: Dr. Peoples at Columbia, and A.P. Crary at Woods Hole. Both scientists were assigned to MOGUL for the entire length of the project. ...</p>

  <p>There is something else.  You ever hear of the Pacific Decadal
  Oscillation?  This is a cyclic phenomenon of the Pacific ocean that
  has a great impact on sea surface temperatures and other parameters. 
  A graph is shown below.  We were in the warm phase from roughly 1976
  to roughly 2005 and now appear to be in a cool phase.  The strongest
  El Niños like to be in the warm phase, which is not where we are now. 
  So perhaps we should be careful about predicting super El Niños.</p>

Perhaps the amount of mass in the atmosphere really isn't a controlling variable? Perhaps composition or even distance to external heat sources is more important?</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm right that islands like Iceland is made of the oceanicp plate because it is in middle of the oceanic plates? But did all 'countries' start like that? It doesn't seem so as most countries/continents are made of lighter material. So how did that lighter material get on top of the oceanic plate?</p>

<p>The explanation of an other answer was: ' This is because the magma that solidifies to form each of these crusts travels, by partially melting its way up, through different materials and different thicknesses. The consequence of this is that the crust making up the continents is less dense than that making up the bottom of the oceans.'</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But since floods jumble materials of different origins and ages together, that meant the scientists had to date dozens of different minerals. The youngest crystal in the footprint layer would represent the oldest possible age for the prints; the oldest crystal in the layer above it would represent the youngest they could be.</p>
  
  <p>Using the argon-argon dating technique, by which scientists measure the decay of an isotope called Argon-40 into Argon-39 in order to find the age of crystals, they came up with a rough approximation of the footprints' age: 19,000 years at the oldest, 10,000 or 12,000 years at the youngest.</p>

"If North America were in the southern hemisphere, would the mountains and high desert have to be -east- of Tornado Alley?","<p>I've been trying to collate the reasons why Tornado Alley in North America is what it is. So far, I have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The continental landmass is in the mid-latitudes (where the polar jet has the greatest amount of influence).</p></li>
<li><p>There are no geographic barriers, like bodies of water or mountains, between the North Pole and the rest of the NA landmass. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (and Argentina for the most part) are separated from the South Pole/Antarctica by water.<br />There's not much in the way of cold polar air dipping down as far south as the Florida Panhandle if there's a deep enough trough in the polar jet.</p></li>
<li><p>Sources of abundant heat and moisture at the surface. This primarily comes from the Gulf of Mexico, but there's also the Caribbean Sea, tropical Atlantic, plus the influence of the Gulf Stream and Bermuda High.</p></li>
<li><p>Large areas devoid of rough/rugged terrain. Besides the Appalachians and the Ozarks, there isn't a lot of mountainous terrain in the middle and eastern sections of the continent. The clash between tropical and polar air can continue undisrupted. In fact, the Appalachians can have the same funneling effect to tropical air that the Rockies have, shielding the Mid-Atlantic/Delmarva region while the Mid-South (sometimes even up to the Ohio River Valley) gets raked by tornadoes.</p></li>
<li><p>Mountains and high desert to the west. Warm, dry air coming off the High Plains in the leeward side of the Rockies and the High Plains in eastern New Mexico create westerlies at mid-levels. It acts as a lid, preventing surface moisture from rising. This is called a capping inversion, ""cap"" or elevated mixed layer. When the cap erodes, supercells can erupt.</p></li>
<li><p>Wind shear: Cold, dry northwest winds aloft; warm, dry westerlies at mid levels; and warm, moist air at the surface. Not only is wind direction changing with height, but wind speed as well (if there's a strong flow of moisture from the southeast, a ""low level jet"", then shear is further exacerbated).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But I wonder, what if North America were in the southern hemisphere? Would the mountains and high desert have to be situated on the eastern side of the continent to compensate? The predominant airflow in the northern hemisphere is west to east, due to Coriolis forces caused by the Earth's spin.</p>

<p>The reason that I want to extrapolate is because i want to cover all of the region of the map.</p>

<p>This is the part of my code, which is about what I described:</p>

<pre><code>m = Basemap(projection='merc',llcrnrlat=34,urcrnrlat=42,\
        llcrnrlon=19,urcrnrlon=35,lat_ts=20,resolution='h')

xi = np.arange(19,35,0.01)

yi = np.arange(34,42,0.01)

xi,yi = np.meshgrid(xi,yi)

lon = np.asarray(lon)

lat = np.asarray(lat)

temperature = np.asarray(temperature)

rbf = scipy.interpolate.Rbf(lon, lat, temperature, function='gaussian', smooth=0.)

zi = rbf(xi, yi)

x,y = m(xi, yi)

zi=np.array(zi)

mdata=maskoceans(xi,yi,zi,resolution='f',grid=1.25)

m.drawcoastlines()

m.drawcountries()

m.drawmapboundary(fill_color=""#cce6ff"")

sc = m.contourf(x,y,mdata, np.arange(-15.0,40.01,1),cmap=jet,extend=""both"")
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas about the interpolation methods that I should use and how I could make it work?</p>

<p>I've already used griddata, which works fine, but it is just for interpolation, so the new matrix is limited and it doesn't cover the whole area. I've also read that rbf doesn't work for more than 20 points, but is there any other method for large datasets?</p>

"Are there ways stormwater attenuation can be quantified for comparison between different systems or conditions?","<p>Various sources agree land cover changes impact the attenuation of stormwater. E.g. forest areas generally slow the rainfall-runoff response and moderate it, reducing peaks in hydrographs, as compared to urban areas. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way stormwater attenuation can be quantified, by field measurements (eg. observed streamflow) or model outputs?</strong> If so, what are some examples of how this can be done? The reason to quantify attenuation would be to compare differences in attenuation between different basins or between different conditions within a basin.</p>

"Will global warming lead to agriculture in the Arctic?","<p>From what I understand, global warming will make growing food a lot harder in areas like the American Midwest because temperatures will become too high for most crops. At the same time, Arctic (and Antarctic) regions will heat up and permafrost will melt. Would areas like Alaska, Siberia, and northern Canada then become suitable for large-scale agriculture? And if so, would this be enough to make up for the lost production in warmer areas? Or are there other factors in those areas that would make farming impractical?</p>

"Looking for counter-arguments concerning the melting of glaciers in the alps in the context of global warming","<p>I've recently listend to a talk of Prof. Gernot Patzelt, Austrian Geographer and High Altitude Mountain Researcher.

<p>These arguments are used by a lot climate-change-sceptics. This is why I'm looking for counter-arguments for this line of argument.

"Is there a place where the sea floor descends into the mantle of the earth?","<p>My understanding of plate tectonics is that in the middle of the oceans magma rises from the mantle of the earth, cools and then spreads out, building up the sea floor.

<p>Almost all energy excess is stored in the oceans and common sense says that there have to be a threshold for how much energy the oceans can take up without drastically changing the climate. There are two possibilities: either there is a turn to cooling down the oceans or there isn't.</p>

<p>Could the energy from the oceans take over the climate system totally for a time long enough to be cooled down? Could the energy from the oceans, if big enough cause global storms independent of the insolation? Convective clouds transport warm vapor high up in troposphere where condensation release an enormous amount of energy - mostly as heat energy that spreads from there.

"Yearly changes of solar irradiation and atmospheric feedback","<p>I think I understand the mechanism of water vapor feedback in climate change pretty well: a (theoretical) temperature increase due to some isolated factor (e.g. increase in <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> concentration) causes a shift in water vapor saturation density and an additional evaporation rate. The consequential shift in actual water vapor concentration causes additional absorption together with isotropic re-emission, slowing down the radiation transport. So the theoretical temperature rise <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta T_{nofb}$</span> without consideration of feedback is ""amplified"" by some factor <span class=""math-container"">$\beta$</span>, giving the real temperature rise, with feedback</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\Delta T_{wfb} = \beta \Delta T_{nofb}$</span></p>

<p>Of course I know that this argument has to be replaced by solving a differential equation in a more rigorous treatment. There is no ""before"" and ""after"", there is only the combined effect.</p>

<p><strong>But what if we consider the ""theoretical"" temperature change due to the change in solar irradiation from orbital eccentricity? Shouldn't this be amplified by the same water vapor feedback mechanism as well?</strong></p>

<p>Solar irradiation varies over the year between <span class=""math-container"">$1310$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$W/m^2$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$1420$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$W/m^2$</span>. According to Stefan-Boltzmann's Law in differential form we would have a heating of the ground by direct absorption of sunlight </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{dP}{P}=4 \frac{dT}{T}$</span></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{\Delta P}{P}\approx 4 \frac{\Delta T}{T}$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\Delta T \approx \frac{T}{4} \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{290 K}{4} \frac{90 W/m^2 }{1366 W/m^2}\approx 4.8 K$</span></p>

<p>The favorite answer to <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/11913/does-the-elliptical-orbit-of-the-earth-have-effect-on-earths-climate"">this question</a> shows a plot that seems to indicate that the order of magnitude is indeed like that, the global line shows a variation of about <span class=""math-container"">$3.8$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$K$</span>. I don't know if this was derived from measurements, but I assume that it is somehow substantiated.</p>

<p>But if we now adopt the assumption that these ~5 Kelvin get amplified by the water vapor feedback as well, and take into account that this amplification is said to be in the order of magnitude ~2 in the context of <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> entry by mankind, I would expect the amplified yearly temperature change due to the orbital eccentricity of earth to be <span class=""math-container"">$~10$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$K$</span>.</p>

"Is the magma in one volcano different from the magma in every other volcano?","<p>First off, a confession:  I'm asking this question because of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.

"Could the Dead Sea dry up? and if so, when?","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/17324-dead-sea-completely-vanish.html"">recent</a> <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFMPP11C..05G"">findings</a>, during the last interglacial period, about 120,000 years ago, the precursor of the Dead Sea (Lake Lisan) dried up perhaps entirely. Today, the Dead Sea level is dropping at rates of around >1m/year from the countries surrounding the Sea using all the runoff. Future climate change scenarios for the region suggest even more arid conditions. Even though previous studies suggested that the decrease in water level would stabilize around 100-150 m below current conditions, the <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFMPP11C..05G"">Goldstein et al.

"What would the climate be like on an Earth-like planet if it had only one convection cell per hemisphere?","<p>Earth has three convection cells per hemisphere.

"What is the range of possible atmospheric pressures on the surface of the Earth?","<p>I'm developing an Android app which uses a pressure sensor. Due to storage limitations I have to normalize and scale the atmospheric pressure values. For this I need to know the <strong>extreme values of pressure</strong>.</p>

<p>Different conditions should be respected, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>Weather conditions (low/high)</li>
<li>Locations (high mountains, deep valleys like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea"">Dead Sea</a> with a surface elevation of: -427 m (−1,401 ft))</li>

<p><strong>Edit / additional info</strong></p>

<p>I discovered that my sensor provides values like 980.01 hPa, so there are 2 digits precision (don't know whether this reflects sensor precision). A difference of 0.01 hPa means ~8cm altitude. This might sound little, but I need to calculate the current incline of athletes, so I cannot sacrifice precision. My current scaling algorithm produces normalized numbers from 0 to 32768.

"How do meteorologists grade their past forecasts?","<p>In every professional field, practitioners may come home at the end of the day and say ""Yeah! I knocked it out of the park!"", or alternatively ""Oh, man. Gotta do better tomorrow."" What about meteorologists?</p>

<p>When a meteorologist makes a weather forecast, she will strive to ""get it right"", so that when the date in question arrives her prediction will have matched the actual temperature, dew point, wind velocity and direction, precipitation, etc. But, when that date arrives, and the actual conditions have been measured and compared to the prediction, how is the prediction graded?</p>

<p>Precipitation seems to be the most problematic aspect, as it's quite nonlinear and predicted statistically. What does it mean to have ""gotten it right"" by predicting a 30% chance of precipitation? Yes, it rained 30% of the time? Yes, it rained in 30% of the forecast area? Yes, 30% of the public will answer ""Yes"" if asked whether it rained?</p>

<p>There's complexity in the other metrics as well. For instance, how are errors in the different values compared? Would it be better to get the temperature spot on but the wind velocity 5MPH high, or the wind exactly right but the temperature 5&deg;F high? What about timing: what if that front came through two hours after it was predicted?</p>

<p>Edit: part of the difficulty is getting clarity about the consumer of the weather information. Fred the Farmer wants to know how much rain he can expect in next day or so, but the exact timing probably isn't important. Pete the Party Planner wants to herd his guests into the bar before the front comes through, but if it's going to rain he probably doesn't care whether it drops a quarter inch or a half. And Francine the Fisherman doesn't really care about the precipitation at all (within limits); her world centers around wind and waves.</p>

"Is Mars' mantle homogeneous or heterogeneous and what might this say about mantle convection?","<p>A supervisor of mine made an off-hand comment about the fact that Mars used to have plate tectonics, and there is evidence that Mars used to have plate tectonics, however now it does not. The theory that she mentioned was that Mars is <strong>either</strong> heterogenoeous <strong>or</strong> homogeneous, however I have forgotten which one she said! Now I can't find anything online which says which one it is! Can anyone help me out here?</p>

<p>Also, the follow on from this was that this led to the ceasing of mantle convection which ended the possibilities of plate tectonics? Could somebody more knowledgable than I perhaps outline a theory of why this is? </p>

<p>In addition if mantle convection has ceased, than when do we think it stopped being active? </p>

"Life on Earth previous to us","<p>I've seen in several places that there seems to be an extinction cycle on Earth of approximately 27 million years. I've read this here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1294372/Life-Earth-wiped-27-million-years.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1294372/Life-Earth-wiped-27-million-years.html</a></p>

<p>And also saw a similar explanation on Cosmos last week. Since the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old, that means there have been around 168 different extinction cycles. From what I understand, the Earth will either heat or freeze at extreme temperatures and then either cool or warm until water and life is a possibility again.</p>

<p>Given that this is correct (and definitely correct if I'm wrong, I'm eager to learn!), what are the chances there was a full civilization like ours that got completely wiped out in a different extinction cycle than ours? Is it possible or are there other factors in the history of our planet that would have prevented life from flourishing to the point that we are in now? I do understand that the factors of creating humans exactly like us are pretty drastically low but I suppose I'm referring to 'civilization' as intelligent life.</p>

<p>And a second part to the question, I know there are fossil records in the different layers of sedimentary rock but would there ever have possibly been an extinction event that ruined the Earth so drastically that it destroyed fossils and rocks (i.e. records of the past)? I've read that the oldest fossil found was 3.5 billion years old but it's not conclusive. Do we have a vast record of fossils and life that is billions of years old?</p>

"How do climatologists define the ""start"" of a rainy season in a unimodal monsoonal climate?","<p>For a number of gridcells, all between the 500mm and 800mm rainfall isohyets in sub-Saharan Africa, I've got dekadal rainfall (from FEWS).  They are pretty spread out over the continent and there are a lot of them, so they'll have different seasonality, though they should all be roughly unimodal (particularly given the latitudes that I've got).  </p>

<p>I want to define an algorithm to define the average start and end of the rainy season.  So far, I'm thinking of the following:</p>

<p>For each gridcell:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the month of average maximum rainfall</li>
<li>Find the month prior to the average maximum rainfall month that minimizes the sum of 3 lags of average monthly rainfall, subject to that month containing at least 20% of annual rainfall.  Define it as the average start.</li>
<li>Find the month after the average maximum rainfall month that does the same thing, only with 3 forward lags of average monthly rainfall.  Define that month as the end of the rainy season.</li>
</ol>

<p>The 20% figure seems arbitrary, though I'm not sure what else to do.  I'm not really a climate scientist, though maybe I could play one on television.  Is there an accepted convention here?  If not, any suggestions on improving my algorithm? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mars interdicts approximately 40% of the radiation (per square meter) of the sun that Earth does. It has been claimed that Mars is unsustainable to human life, in part due to the particle radiation from the solar wind, such that a four year round trip to Mars is likely to cause cancer and/or permanent damage to the genome etc.  Why does a pole reversal, which typically takes 1000 years, not have a period of radiation that is intolerable to life? </p></li>
<li><p>Not only do migratory birds require the magnetic pole for direction, certain bacteria/algae do to rise and fall in the oceans correctly.  If the pole reversal is not very quick, why do bird migrations not go askew in major numbers. (P.S. I am a little skeptical of the learned landscape proposal found in the linked question - is there evidence for a similar lateral paths taken by birds, year on year, to prove they are recognizing landscapes? Landscapes and features change very quickly over distance. And if so, does the magnetic direction sense really help the migration? Also, when it does reverse, if magnetic field is a key component to knowing direction, then won't that tend to drive them in the opposite direction, so even a quick final phase of a reversal may result in a large number of missing birds.)  Also, why doesn't the food chain collapse when microbial creatures start to dive deeper when they used to head to the surface as a result of their magnetic compass?</p></li>

<p>From what I read, I presume that solar radiation is a key factor in determining the change in temperature from the start to the end of the reach, so I'm looking for ways to estimate the hourly solar radiation.  Then I can try a regression model of end-of-reach temperature vs. start-of-reach temperature and solar radiation.</p>

"Effective Temperature of a Planet and Surface Temperature due to Greenhouse Effect","<p>There is something I don't quite understand about the Greenhouse Effect and Effective Temperature, so please bear with me as I lay out what I do understand and where I begin to stumble.</p>

<p>The effective temperature of the Earth is roughly 12 degree Fahrenheit, which means that in thermal equilibrium when it is emitting as much radiation as it is absorbing, the distribution of wavelengths and intensities of electromagnetic radiation an observer in outer space would measure would correspond to the temperature of a blackbody object at 12 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<p>Of course, the surface of the Earth is actually much warmer than 12 degrees Fahrenheit due to the Greenhouse Effect. If there are greenhouse gases in an atmosphere then some fraction of infrared radiation from the terrestrial surface is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted toward the ground. This re-emission of infrared radiation to the ground is like a trap for energy and over time it will cause the surface temperature of the planet to rise. This is right about where I have actual questions:</p>

<p>If the terrestrial surface is warming it will have to emit even more infrared radiation back to space. Is the atmosphere (and greenhouse gases) now absorbing the same fraction of a now larger amount of infrared radiation? in order to eventually rebalance incoming and outgoing radiation? I was thinking that the surface will grow warmer and emit more radiation until the amount exiting equals the amount incoming, establishing the new thermal equilibrium. </p>

<p>I often get confused because most diagrams for the Earth energy budget and net radiation balance show more infrared leaving the surface than is ever supplied by solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere in the first place. Is this because they count percentages or units of radiation twice? because some is re-emitted back?</p>

<p>I have included a photo showing how the electromagnetic wave types are partitioned in the radiation balance. It is from NASA's CERES page. As you can see, more infrared is leaving Earth than enters as solar radiation and yet this is still a picture of equilibrium where the net radiation is zero. </p>

"Could the Grand Canyon be flooded by the ocean if it got deep enough?","<p>The Colorado River has been carving the Grand Canyon for a few million years now, such that the canyon floor is around 6000 feet lower in elevation than the surrounding area, at about 2400 feet above sea level. If things continue as they have, the Colorado River will continue to make the canyon deeper. If the river eroded away enough rock so that the river's bottom got to sea level, and this process continued to go upstream the river from where it empties into the Pacific Ocean so that the floor of the canyon eventually eroded below sea level, would the canyon gradually be filled in by the ocean? Would this even be possible? If not, why don't we see the mouth of the Colorado (or any river for that matter) gradually  move upstream, with ocean filling in where the river once was? </p>

The <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/36703/11181"">top answer</a> to that question is basically ""no."" </p>

<p>A <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/36702/can-artificial-satellite-positions-affect-tides#comment116761_36703"">commenter</a> estimates that Pluto might have a larger effect, but Pluto is such a distant object I didn't think most people could easily relate to that, so I tried running the numbers with something people might be more familiar with, closer to our surface: airplanes.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's start by considering a big plane in relatively common use.  The Boeing 747 is well known as a popular aircraft type, and it <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seems</a> that the version of it they're producing now is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing 747-8</a>.  <a href=""https://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acdata_php/acdata_boeing_7478_en.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> says it has a maximum takeoff weight of 4.48*10<sup>5</sup> kg and a maximum landing weight of 3.12*10<sup>5</sup> kg, with a service ceiling of 1.3*10<sup>4</sup> m.  I'll round that to a weight of 3.5*10<sup>5</sup> kg mass and 1*10<sup>4</sup> m height above the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>Now, the moon.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says the moon has a mass of around 7*10<sup>22</sup> kg and a distance from the center of the earth on the order of 4*10<sup>6</sup> km, which is 4*10<sup>9</sup> m.  Earth's radius, about 6.3*10<sup>3</sup> km, is about a tenth of a percent of that distance and lost in the rounding/simplification of the Moon's orbit to be circular instead of its actual eccentricity. </p>

<p>This means that the moon's mass is (7*10<sup>22</sup> kg / 3.5*10<sup>5</sup> kg =) 2*10<sup>17</sup> times that of the 747.
The moon's distance from the surface of the ocean is (4*10<sup>9</sup> m / 1*10<sup>4</sup>m =) 4*10<sup>5</sup> times that of the 747.  </p>

<p>Comments on <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/36703/11181"">this answer</a> note that ""the amplitude of tides is proportional not to the strength of the gravity force, which is proportional to r<sup>2</sup>, but to its gradient, which is proportional to r<sup>3</sup>...a factor of 10<sup>3</sup> in distance means a factor of 10<sup>9</sup> in tidal effect.""  Therefore, the effect that the distance has on the amplitude would be ((4*10<sup>5</sup>)<sup>3</sup> =) 6.4*10<sup>16</sup>.</p>

<p>Thus the overall effect of the 747 on tides should be (6.4*10<sup>16</sup> / 2*10<sup>17</sup> =) <strong>about a third of the effect of the moon</strong>.  It's a back-of-the-envelope order-of-magnitude calculation, but a much larger result than I expected.  </p>

<p>Did I mess up somewhere in the math or facts above?  (If not, I'm willing to cut &amp; paste that content into an Answer, but for now it's just showing the work I've done in arriving at this question and attempting to solve it myself.)</p>

<p>Now, there are <strong>many</strong> flights in the sky at any given moment, all around the world, and to a certain extent any tidal effects of one flight would be cancelled out by the effects of one or more others.   However, the flight map is not completely balanced or evenly distributed north-south or east-west. </p>

If the elastic limit of a typical rock is $3 \times 10^8\ \mathrm{N/m}$ and its mean density is $3 \times 10^3\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}$, then the breaking stress is $h\,\rho\,\mathrm{g}$, where $h$ is height, $\rho$ is the density of the rock, and $\mathrm{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Then</p>

"What color(s) would Earth be without water or life?","<p>Many of the celestial bodies in our solar system have well-established color schemes, at least in the minds of the public.  <a href=""http://mars.nasa.gov/images/mars-globe-valles-marineris-enhanced.jpg"">Mars</a> is pale-red and black, <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Venus_globe.jpg"">Venus</a> (beneath the clouds) is generally shown in rich yellows and oranges, the <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg"">Moon</a> ranges from dark to light gray, etc.</p>

"Possibility to influence oceanic evaporation to protect Sahel/Sahara","<p>When reading about the projects that want to plant trees on the Sahel-Sahara border, for protection of the Sahel, I wonder what other possibilities there are.</p>

<p>Like, would it be possible to influence precipitation in the Sahara desert by enlarging the evaporation of seas and oceans.</p>

<p>This question would combine a number of different sub-questions.</p>

<p>First of all, would moistening the air help at all? When reading Wikipedia, it looks like the air in the Sahara is extremely dry, but there's also a lack of precipitation generation mechanism. Can rain be generated there if the air would be wetter?</p>

<p>Secondly, when it rains in the Sahara, where does the rain come from? The main wind over the Sahara desert is an eastern to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_wind_patterns#/media/File:Map_prevailing_winds_on_earth.png"" rel=""nofollow"">northeastern</a> wind. So it comes from over the Asian mainland, and can't carry a lot of water.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does it mainly come from different winds (like an occasional western wind)?</li>
<li>Does it mainly come from evaporation of the red sea (though that has a small surface)</li>
<li>Does it get carried all the way over Asia, so coming from the Pacific ocean?</li>
<li>Anything other ideas?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thirdly (this is more a physics question), is it feasible to alter the evaporation rate of a large water body (feasible as in comparison to the tree-planting project, so it can cost a few billions). The experiments I've found wrt the relation between water-surface temperature and evaporation seem to suggest an exponential relation. Which is at least nice, </p>

<p>Water doesn't have a colour, so it doesn't extract a lot of energy from the solar rays (at least not at the surface, but the energy gets spread over the entire depth). If we could let an energy-absorbing coloured surface (a black surface) float just a few inches under water, it could heat the water surface and make it evaporate more.</p>

<p>By making it evaporate relatively near the coast (as opposed to evaporation in the middle of the ocean), the majority of rain will also have to fall on land </p>

<p>When this technique could be applied to a decent portion of the Red Sea, the surface temperature could be enlarged sufficiently, which could let the Red Sea act as a big ocean, thus result in a wetter Sahara and Sahel.</p>

<p>This might of course be a very stupid idea (like the majority of fresh ideas).</p>

<p>I thought someone would have studied this thoroughly before me (at least before planing millions of trees), but I couldn't find a lot of info on it (not even on the basic questions like how strongly surface colour influences evaporation).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading through this, and trying to answer (a part of) it.</p>

"What makes a nuclear winter so extreme and destructive?","<p>This may be a sort of, pertinent to the times, and disturbing question, inspired by the difficulties surrounding North Korea and the situation with it and nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>I've heard of this idea of ""nuclear winter"" that can result from a nuclear exchange, and more interestingly, very surprisingly, and disturbingly, that a major winter could be caused by even a ""small"" nuclear exchange, like on this paper:</p>

<p><a href=""http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/WiresClimateChangeNW.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/WiresClimateChangeNW.pdf</a></p>

<p>suggests that only ""150 teragrams"" of ""smoke"" released from a Nuclear exchange, would be able to produce a HUGE temperature drop of 7 degrees C for a couple of years or so, with attendant devastating effects on agriculture - indeed there's another version of this I saw with a map showing far greater temperature drops, like 20 degrees C or more, in places like Europe and North America (the USA) over land, right where the breadbaskets would be. Considering that it's not just crops but other plants as well that would be affected, its would seem to be a geologically significant event for a fair number of life forms, not just humans.</p>

<p>But the thing I'm having trouble with is just how is this possible, in particular, this magnitude, because it seems to be comparable to, if not greater than, <em>natural</em> events that would seemingly be of far greater magnitude. The 150 teragrams of carbon soot is only like a cube 400 meters on a side when solid, which is then vaporized and spread throughout the atmosphere, but that seems utterly tiny compared to the release of thousands of cubic kilometers of ash and other materials from volcanic and super-volcanic eruptions(*), much more asteroid strikes like Chicxulub releasing doubtless millions of cubic kilometers of material of all sorts. Is the soot really tens or hundreds of thousands of times more powerful per unit mass at cooling than anything released from any of these events would be? Or what? Further, especially considering that an event like Chicxulub would no doubt have ignited at least continent-scale areas of of forests in the area around it if nowhere else from the ejecta storm, which doubtless would have produced far more black carbon soot than burning down all the cities in a nuclear war, no? Yet this suggests effects that, while not equal, seem almost comparable - and this is considered for a much diminished set of arsenals, compared to what they were at their peak, suggesting the peak could perhaps even eclipse the Chicxulub at a tiny fraction of the total energy release from the latter. What would have happened to the Earth in an imaginary scenario where the 100 million megatons (400 zettajoules) of Chicxulub asteroid energy were replaced with 100 million megatons of hydrogen bomb mushroom clouds exploding over a comparable area of forests (alien attack? :) ) to those that the asteroid would have burned, 65-66 million years ago?</p>

<p>(*) See, e.g. </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory#Volcanic_winter_and_cooling"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory#Volcanic_winter_and_cooling</a></p>

<p>where it is mentioned how that the Toba super volcanic eruption was first thought to have produced a big cooling, but more recent evidence suggests it may not have. Yet the nuclear war seems able to almost match it, with only 150 teragrams of carbon vs. 6 000 teragrams of SO2. Now of course maybe the former is better absorber (gas vs. fine dark solid), but literally so much better that the latter could barely move the meter (according to observational evidence, not the simulation mentioned), while the former would drop it 7 degrees C, 20+ in some areas? And that's just the SO2 component, what about all the other material released by the eruption to no doubt similar very great heights? And furthermore, how does this all fit in with Chicxulub? Is there any data on the ""anti greenhouse"" power of C soot versus SO2 and other materials released by volcanoes and asteroid strikes?</p>

<p>In short, what makes nuclear weapons so damn <em>good</em> at being destructive, compared to everything that nature seems to have in its arsenal short of the death of the Sun itself, despite seemingly the much greater raw power in terms of energy of the latter?</p>

<p>Also, is there a source that calculates MPI for each model and each hurricane?</p>

<p>For reference, $$v_{MPI}=\sqrt{\frac{C_k(T_s-T_0)}{C_dT_0}\Delta k}=\sqrt{\frac{T_sC_k}{T_0C_d}(CAPE_s-CAPE_b)}$$
where $v_{MPI}$ is the theoretical maximum speed (MPI), $C_k$ is the surface drag coefficient of enthalpy, $C_D$ is the surface drag coefficient, $\Delta k$ is the change in enthalpy between the surface and environment, $T_s$ is the sea surface temperature, $T_0$ is the outflow temperature, $CAPE_s$ is the convective available potential energy (CAPE) from sea level and $CAPE_b$ is the
CAPE of the boundary layer air.</p>

"A few questions about glass","<p>A glass, as I understand it, is a material whose solid phase is amorphous and which undergoes a glass transition when heated.  </p>

<p>My train of thought - and therefore my questions - began with obsidian.  My understanding is that obsidian is formed from material that would normally form crystalline rock, but since it's exposed to air during an eruption, it cools too rapidly to crystallize and therefore solidifies as glass.  This led me to wonder: how large can a lava stream be and still produce obsidian?  In particular, in season 7 of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the island of Dragonstone is revealed to contain a veritable mountain of obsidian - is such a thing possible in the real world?  I would have thought that, above a certain volume, the center of the mass would be well-enough insulated so that crystallization could occur, spoiling the obsidian.  What's the largest mass of obsidian found in nature?</p>

<p>Thinking about too-rapid cooling led me to another question: can water form glass?  Is it possible to blast-freeze water so quickly that ice crystals do not form?  If so, what would be the properties of such a glass?</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder about regular, garden-variety silicate glass (as found in windows and bottles.)  Can it be cooled slowly enough so that crystals <em>do</em> form?  And if so, what are its properties?  (Have I essentially re-invented quartz?)</p>

"Could we cool the ocean by reflecting away sunlight to influence hurricanes?","<p>I was wondering if we could possibly reduce the severity of, or steer a hurricane by changing albedo (e.g. dying the part ocean with a temporary light colored dye)?  My thought would be to put this dye well in front of the path of a hurricane, with enough time to reflect the sunlight back off the ocean and cool the ocean surface.  When the hurricane arrives there, the ocean surface should then be cooler, leading to the hurricane being less powerful.  I am also wondering if this could be used to steer the hurricane somehow (e.g. if a hurricane would be drawn to or repelled away from cool ocean surface).  If so, could we use that to steer a hurricane away from populated areas?</p>

<p><strong>Some potential methods (there may be others):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use light colored dye injected into the ocean</p></li>
<li><p>Use light colored smoke to block the sun from reaching the ocean</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly use ""cloud seeding"" ahead of the hurricane and form clouds to block the sun light from warming the ocean. - Covered in the alternate question</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps a ""surface film"" could also be applied temporarily to part of the ocean (sort of like a ""light colored oil spill"", hopefully with something safer for the environment than oil). - Covered in the alternate question</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If this experiment were to be conducted, I would think it should be done far from inhabited land.  Environmental impacts would need to be thought out too, e.g. would a film block the carbon dioxide / oxygen exchange in that area and cause severe environmental impact?  Could the experiment actually strengthen instead of weaken a hurricane?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The linked question and answer addresses some, but not all the methods I propose here.  It also proposes some other methods, definitely an interesting read!</p>

  <p>Forecast models typically show their skill with three-, four-, and five-day forecasts. For simplicity's sake, we will focus on 120-hour forecasts. At this lead time, the average error of the European model with respect to Irma has been about 175km in its position forecast. The next best forecast is from the hurricane center, which is slightly more than 300km. An automated model, then, has so far beaten human forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (looking at all of this model data) by a wide margin.  </p>

"Does the magnetic field really protect Earth from anything?","<p>Many topics discussed here in Earth Science SE, tend to be about facts that are of consensus in the scientific community but not widely accepted by the general public. Instead, this one is widely accepted by the general public but it seems to generate doubts and debates between the leading scientists in the field.</p>

<p>We have always heard that Earth's magnetic field protects us from harmful <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cosmic radiation</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">solar wind</a>, that would otherwise <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">strip the atmosphere away</a> and kill us all due to high doses ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>Well, all that seem to actually be under debate. Because (if I understand the issue correctly), the magnetic field deflects most of the incoming charged particles, but on the other hand it increases dramatically the cross sectional area through which Earth interacts with the solar wind.</p>

<p>This figure from Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Magnetosphere</a> page will illustrate the problem:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMRSH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uMRSH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, most of the charged particles are deflected away from Earth (orange lines), but a fraction of them gets funneled towards the poles through the so called ""polar cusps"" (yellow lines), that's why <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">auroras</a> (a.k.a. northern lights) happen around the poles.
As you can see, the size of the polar cusps ""funnels"" is comparable to the size of the Earth, therefore giving rise to the discussion if the magnetic field increases or decreases the amount of charged particles that hit the atmosphere: If the funnels are smaller than the Earth the magnetic field would decrease the amount of particles hitting the Earth, but if the funnels are larger the particles hitting us would increase.</p>

<p>These charged particles are usually cited as relevant due to two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>They are harmful to life by increasing the dose of ionizing radiation that reach the surface. Such radiation in turn generates mutations in the DNA.</li>
<li>They can hit molecules in the atmosphere fast enough to send them to outer space, leading to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">atmospheric escape</a> and the thinning of our beloved atmosphere.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is only partially true, because the atmosphere itself is an extraordinary shield against cosmic and solar radiation. Therefore, even in the eventual shutdown of Earth's magnetic field, not much radiation would reach the surface anyway. That's perhaps one of the reasons why nobody has been able to link <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">magnetic reversals</a> to mass extinctions. More on that is discussed in <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/14838/why-are-pole-reversals-not-more-detrimental-to-life/14844#14844"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>The second point is also questionable, because although the magnetic field does redirect the charged particles to the poles, it is unclear if the amount of particles currently hitting polar areas is more or less than the amount that would hit the entire Earth in the absence of a magnetic field. Notably, atmospheric escape would be equally bad if it happen distributed over the globe or if it is concentrated at the poles.</p>

<p>It is important to note that in this question I refer to the intrinsic magnetic field. Because, all bodies with atmosphere that are exposed to the solar wind develop an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Induced_magnetosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">induced magnetic field</a>. This induced magnetic field is observed in Venus, Mars and even comets. However, it is much weaker that Earth's intrinsic magnetic field.</p>

<p>The lack of intrinsic magnetic field is often blamed as one of the reasons that Mars lost its atmosphere. However, Venus have always challenged that idea: Venus have an atmosphere much thicker than Earth's and it doesn't have an intrinsic magnetic field. <a href=""https://www.space.com/11187-earth-magnetic-field-solar-wind.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This article from Space.com</a> describes how this discussion was restarted due to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>recent observations that show Mars and Venus are losing oxygen ions
  from their atmospheres into space at about the same rate as Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they cite <a href=""http://www-spc.igpp.ucla.edu/~strange/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robert Strangeway</a> (a leading scientist in the field) saying ""My opinion is that the magnetic shield hypothesis is unproven"".
Strangeway also presented a poster on last year's AGU fall meeting describing the same skepticism: ""<a href=""https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/265705"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Does an Intrinsic Magnetic Field Inhibit or Enhance Planetary Ionosphere Outflow and Loss?</a>""</p>

<p>In that work he backs the above cite of Space.com with actual numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The oxygen ion outflow is frequently assumed to be a proxy for the
  loss of water from the planetary atmosphere. In terms global outflow
  rates for the Earth the rate varies from $10^{25}$ to $10^{26}$
  s$^{−1}$, depending on geomagnetic activity. For both Venus and Mars
  global rates of the order $5 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{−1}$ have been
  reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving some credit to his skepticism, his work was cited in <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103517306917?via%3Dihub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a 2018 paper</a> written by most if not all the leading scientist behind the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MAVEN probe</a> that have been orbiting Mars since 2014. There they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>our expectation is that stripping of atmospheric gas by the solar wind
  is minimized by the presence of a magnetic field (e.g., Hutchins et al.,
  1997), although observations of escaping ions at Earth suggest that
  this may not be strictly correct (Strangeway et al.,2017).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second author of that paper: Dave Brain, also gave a very interesting TED talk where he mentions the topic: <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/dave_brain_what_a_planet_needs_to_sustain_life"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What a planet needs to sustain life</a> (starting at minute 7:31).</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by the topic, but my understanding of the physics of Earth's magnetic field is minimal. So I wonder: <strong>What evidence is there supporting that the intrinsic magnetic field really protects Earth's atmosphere and its living organisms?</strong></p>

<p>In other words: In the absence of models and speculations of how the intrinsic magnetic field interacts with charged particles: <strong>Is there any reason to believe that a stronger magnetic field offers more protection than a weak or negligible one?</strong> </p>

"Are hurricane storm surges smaller when the storms strike small islands?","<p>My understanding of a storm surge is that it is caused by the hurricane ""pushing"" water towards the land. When a hurricane makes landfall, this water washes up on the short generating a storm surge. From the Wikipedia article, certain geographical features such as shallow water or a funnel-shaped landfall point can exacerbate surges since the water pushed by the storm cannot dissipate (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge</a>).</p>

<p>(3) $-i \omega \hat h + \partial_x H\hat u + \partial_y H\hat v = 0$ </p>

<p>where my unknows are $\hat u$,$\hat v$,$\hat h$, and only two parameters possibly showing spatial variation : $r$ and $H$. I tried to discretize it with finite differences but I quickly realize that I needed to be very careful with my boundary conditions. Because the 3 variables that I wanted to determined where closely linked to one another and that actually $\hat u$ and $\hat v$ could easily be determined by the derivatives of $\hat h$.</p>

<p>So I modified my system  in order to solve only this variable and came with the following set of equations :</p>

<p>(4) $ \hat u = \frac{-g(r-i \omega)\partial_x \hat h -fg\partial_y \hat h}{f²+(r-i\omega)²}$</p>

<p>(5) $ \hat v = \frac{-g(r-i \omega)\partial_y \hat h +fg\partial_x \hat h}{f²+(r-i\omega)²}$</p>

<p>(6) $ i \omega \hat h = \partial_x(\frac{H}{f²+(r-i\omega)²}(-g(r-i \omega)\partial_x \hat h -fg\partial_y \hat h)) + \partial_y(\frac{H}{f²+(r-i\omega)²}(-g(r-i \omega)\partial_y \hat h +fg\partial_x \hat h)) $</p>

<p>Then I tried to approximate the derivates with centered first order scheme. I tried to reproduce a Kelvin coastal wave on a reduced domain (10*10 cells). However, I am at best able not to crash it and most of the time have very strong oscillations in the center. </p>

"Can anyone help me identify this rock?","<p>This is probably just something really common and boring to most people, but I was intrigued so I thought I might as well ask now I can. When I was in Portugal (I don’t know specifically where we were) when I was 6 (I’m now 15) I found some rocks on a beach that I thought were really interesting. They ended up coming home with us after the holiday, and I just rediscovered one in the house. This particular one doesn’t, but some of them I found seemed to have some sort of crystal inside?? It reminded me of those quartz crystal dragon eggs (I don’t know what else they would be called?) except it was only a few tiny bits where you could see into what seemed to be a hollow rock besides the crystal or whatever it was. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DIx9M.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Seeming correlation between time of day and earthquakes","<p>I live in a generally geographically active area (Southern California, near the San Andreas fault, if that matters), that has had two relatively minor earthquakes that I have felt in the last week (in the 3-4 range on the Richter Scale, I believe), as well as frequently in the past. I am used to this, being born and raised in the region.</p>

<p>I was talking about these phenomena with a colleague who recently moved to the area from a non-earthquake prone place, and was not used to them. I realized that both of the earthquakes were late at night, when I was in bed, and searching my memory I can only recall encountering these minor earthquakes at similar times.</p>

<p>My question, therefore, is if there is any correlation between time of day and earthquakes? Or to put it another way, is my observation based on anything more than the fact that I am more likely to note and recall a minor earthquake what I am not engaged in another activity?</p>

"Why can't the meteorologists predict for sure if the day would be rainy even on the beginning of the day sometimes?","<p>Why do the meteorologists still cannot predict if a day would be rainy or cloudy or blizzardy even on the beginning of the day sometimes?</p>

<p>My life circles around weather and an avid weather watcher.</p>

<p>And I noticed the computers still are not advanced enough to get all the variables to predict the weather accurately. The weathermen and women still read the probabilities. For example, there is a 70% chance of rain. I take the umbrella outside and there is no rain. Then the prediction is the day would be cloudy. But then there is rain. I am not saying it happens most of the time. But it happens sometimes. </p>

<p>Do we need a quantum computer then with qubits? Because it can hold a myriad of variables and consider them in the calculation of the weather. </p>

"How is this crumbly crystal-rich rock formed?","<p>I found this crumbly rock embedded in the channel walls of a small creek in Everett, WA, USA. (North Creek that flows through McCollum Park.)

<p>I would have called it granite or some other relative; to my non-expert eye, I see feldspars, some quartz, and mica. Except that it's very crumbly. Here's a video that shows better the texture and how loosely-bound the crystals are to each other. You can flake them all off with your hand.</p>

"Synoptic weather predictibility under climate change scenarios","<p>Under climate change scenarios, it is quite certain that high latitude regions will experience more warming than at low latitudes. For example, in winter the reduced area of sea ice and snow cover should have the amplifying effect for temperature rising over polar region. Thus the meridional temperature gradient would also be reduced, so as the baroclinicity. Baroclinicity is important in theories concerning synoptic weather forecast in mid-latitudes.</p>

"What does it mean when the depth of earthquakes get near the surface over a period of time?","<p>First of all, I am not expert at this so correct me. My hometown is Shiraz and since last year I can sense the earth is moving. I call them  mini earthquakes. But many people around me can not sense it. Some time ago there was an earthquake it felt like a 5 or even 6 richter earthquake but it was a 4 ricther earthquake but then in news they said that the depth was so close to the surface (4 km). I take a look at the USGS archives for Shiraz with in a 90 km diameter (as back in time as it was available) which I think will cover the major and minor fault lines. If you want to take a look its at <a href=""http://bit.ly/usgsarchive"" rel=""noreferrer"">a link</a>! usgs archives[a]

"How do I derive the formula for lithostatic (overburden) pressure?","<p>The title pretty much says it. I have the formula: $P = \rho g h$ where $\rho$ is the density, $h$ is how deep the pressure is in the Earth and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration(?).</p>

"Argument for designing an ocean monitoring network based on satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration?","<p>The idea is to design an integrated marine monitoring network by surveying in parallel the chlorophyll-a and the other oceanography parameters, which are either trophically related with the concentration of chlorophyll-a (e.g. nutrients, zooplankton) or topically-related (having the same origin), e.g. nutrients and contaminants have the same land-based point sources of pollution.</p>

<p>The simplest approach is to place the sampling stations at equal distance from the land-based sources of pollution to detect of the pressure from pollution with nutrients and contaminants and its effect on the marine ecosystem. This approach is supported by the fact that the water column parameters have relatively homogeneous distribution, because of the water mixing.</p>

<p>The question is: is there an argument for applying a more sophisticated approach of using the analysis average multi-annual satellite-derived spatial change in the concentration of chlorophyll-a for choosing a sampling location of the monitoring network? And if it is, what method can be used to place the sampling stations (Besides the <a href=""http://resources.arcgis.com/en/helmain/10.1/index.html#//00300000000p000000%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ArcGIS Sampling Network Design Tool</a>)?</p>

<p>where $d_s$ is the number of degrees of freedom for the signal, tr denotes the trace, and $A$ is the averaging kernel matrix.</p>

<p>I'm trying to properly understand this.  For example, is it theoretically possible for the averaging kernel to have mainly or even exclusively off-diagonal elements?  In practice, this would mean that the retrieved state at height $h$ would correspond to the true state at height $h+1$, if we take remote sounding of an atmospheric column as an example.  In such a (admittedly contrived) example, we could get $d_s=0$, although we do have information in the measurement — it's just displaced.</p>

"Is Bowen ratio an absolute indicator of land surface type based on the amount of heat transfer from the surface?","<p>Bowen ratio (BR) is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux, i.e., </p>

<p>$$Q=Q_{s}/Q_{l}$$
where $Q_{s}$ is the sensible heat flux and $Q_{l}$ is the latent heat flux. It is an indicator of the amount of heat lost from the surface to the atmosphere. In water bodies, latent heat of vaporization is higher and hence the bowen ratio is less than one. In dry urban surfaces (e.g., buildings and asphalt roads), evaporation is lower and the bowen ratio is greater than one. 
The bowen ratio over different surfaces have different values. </p>

<p>Can we then identify the underlying surface roughness type based on the bowen ratio alone? </p>

<p>I am thinking of the latitudinal and altitudinal dependence of the heat flux regime. For example, assume that there are the same vegetation distribution at 1km above sea level (a.s.l) and 4 km a.s.l at different but relatively closer latitudes, then can they have the same bowen ratio? </p>

<p>My idea is that BR is not the right way of quantifying the type of surface roughness because the lower pressure and temperature at 4 km in the example above favors more sensible heat flux than latent heat flux which increases the bowen ratio and gives wrong signal that the surface type is bare soil or sand.
Can someone explain why BR is used as a means of quantifying the surface roughness type? </p>

<p>which carries a link to the abstract of a peer-reviewed Science paper <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/11/02/science.aag2345"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission</a>. However the abstract says (in part):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we here use a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 m<sup>2</sup> of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is about the simplification of linking tons of CO<sub>2</sub> to square meters of ice, and without reference to time. The abstract seems to simply say that there appears to be a linear relationship, and since models disagree, then this is a ""good enough"" way to think about it. </p>

<p>Is it so simple - if in 2017 no CO<sub>2</sub> were burned the sea ice would return to normal? No. The summer sea ice would likely continue to decrease for decades. An analogy might be births and deaths of a population. While there might be a rough (or ""robust"") correlation between birth rate and death rate, a cessation of births in a given year would have almost no impact on death rate for perhaps a half-century. </p>

<p>Is there any mathematics that justifies this simple ""robust linear relationship"" to be causal? What does ""directly follows"" mean?</p>

<p>I'm <em>not in any way</em> questioning the causality between CO<sub>2</sub> and a wide variety of changes in climate, including reduction in summer sea-ice. I'm only questioning the original quote and the quantitative relationship: <em>1 metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> costs 3 square meters of summer sea ice</em>.</p>

"How does humidity vary with height in the Earth's atmosphere?","<p>I am busy with the development of an ""environment"" model that can be used for flight simulation of all kinds of flight vehicles — ranging from quad-copters, unmanned aerial vehicles, manned aircraft, up to rocket launchers for satellites.  The model consists of sub-models for terrestrial gravity; the earth's size, shape, and motions; the geomagnetic field; the atmosphere; and so on.  </p>

<p>Currently I am using the <a href=""http://www.sparc-climate.org/data-center/data-access/reference-climatologies/cira-86/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA-86)</a> to calculate air pressure and temperature for heights up to 120 km. But, to be able to calculate air density, I also need to model the effects of humidity.  I know that water vapour is only present in varying quantities in the troposhere, and that high humidity is therefore more likely at lower altitudes.  </p>

<p>Does anybody have models of the probability of experiencing some value of relative humidity as a function of height above sea level?</p>

<p><strong>Edit.</strong> As an example of what I really need, the MIL-F-8785C model for wind speed and turbulence, for example, gives the mean wind speed at a height of 6.1 m above the ground, given the logarithm of the probability of exceeding the wind speed. So, a model of the humidity as a probability of exceeding the the mean humidity as a function of height is what I really need.  Do you know of any models that provide this?</p>

"Is oxygen spread equally on Earth's surface?","<p>We know that oxygen comes from trees and plants (photosynthesis), so in the jungle where there are a lot of trees you would expect more oxygen than in the desert where there are no trees. Walking in the desert is tough, but is that also due to there being less oxygen?</p>

<p>I know oxygen averages about 21% of the air.  Diffusion and winds probably means there is at least enough oxygen to live in the deserts and on the poles.  But could the oxygen perhaps be lower in those regions, and what is the minimum percentage that humans need to live?</p>

"Could evidence of a signal from an exocivilization be found in the geologic record?","<p>We know that the current SETI efforts have not found evidence for the existence of intelligent exo-civilizations (XCIV). There also has not been any evidence found of ancient non-human civilizations in the fossil record. One possibility, among many, is that XCIVs only exist for a geologically short amount of time before collapsing/extinction. Then, it could be possible that, even though none exist now, one or more XCIV could have existed in the past, and it was capable of transmitting electromagnetic (EM) radiation signals.</p>

<p>So, consider the following hypothesis:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the last 100 million years, at least one XCIV capable of emitting directed EM radiation existed within 100 light-years of our solar system.</li>
<li>The CIV sent directed EM beams towards all the planets in the star systems surrounding it.</li>
<li>Based on what it could detect about each planet's composition, it designed the beams (frequency, signaling pattern, modulation, etc...) such that they would leave as large of a mark on the targeted planet's geologic record as possible (the mark).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question: Is there any form of patterned, extra-solar EM radiation that could theoretically leave a mark in the geologic record that could be recognizable to us as such up to 100 million years later? And could a human-level civilization be capable of projecting such beams?</strong></p>

"Dynamic meteorology - calculating air temperature based off falling air","<p>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this. Basically I have an exercise in dynamic meteorology that is set up like this:</p>

  <p>1 kg of dry air is falling with a constant speed of 0.5 cm / s and 0.1
  w/kg of heat is extracted. Does the air volume temperature rise, fall
  or does it remain unchanged?</p>

<p>$w = 0.5 \frac{cm}{s}$</p>

<p>$J= -0.1 \frac{w}{kg}$</p>

<p>$T? $</p>

<p>$J = Cp \frac{dT}{dt} - \alpha  \frac{dp}{dt}$</p>

<p>$J = Cp \frac{dT}{dt} - \frac{1}{\rho}  \frac{dp}{dt}$</p>

<p>$\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{\delta p}{\delta t} + u  \frac{\delta p}{\delta x} + v \frac{\delta p}{\delta y} + w \frac{\delta p}{\delta z} = w \frac{\delta p}{\delta z}$</p>

<p>(because $\frac{\delta p}{\delta t} + u  \frac{\delta p}{\delta x} + v \frac{\delta p}{\delta y} = 0$)</p>

<p>$ \frac{\delta p}{\delta z} = -\rho g$</p>

<p>$\frac{dp}{dt} = w \frac{\delta p}{\delta z} = w -\rho g$</p>

<p>$J = Cp \frac{dT}{dt} - \frac{-1 w \rho g}{\rho} = Cp \frac{dT}{dt} + \rho g$</p>

<p>$$\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{J-gw}{Cp} = \frac{-0.1 \frac{w}{kg} - 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}   0.5 \frac{cm}{s}}{1004.5 \frac{J}{K * kg}} $$</p>

"If the accuracy of measurement of the earth's volume is not known, how can scientists assert that the earth is not expanding?","<p>Volcanic eruptions, undersea earthquakes, fissures in the crust, meteoroid accumulation could all be seen as empirical evidence of expansion of the earth. Sink holes and other phenomena could be contrary evidence. Subduction of crustal layers and changes in the earth's rate of rotation could be cited as evidence one way or the other. But the net effect, if measurable at all, might well fall within the range of inaccuracy of the earth's volume estimate. 
Moreover, nuclear fission produces elements of lesser density. Could this process not produce a reduction of density in the mantle, and hence provide a mechanism for expansion of the earth?
I realize that the effect of these factors, although large on a human scale, may well be tiny when compared to the total earth volume.
Nonetheless, whatever the measurement or estimate of these factors, how can their effect on the earth's volume, over eons, be considered insignificant, if the accuracy of the total volume of the earth is not known to a degree of certainty?</p>

"Potassum-Argon Dating and Proportions of Daughter Products in Potassium 40 Decay Channel","<p>So Potassium 40 decays in such a way that roughly 89% of it becomes Calcium 40 and 11% of it becomes Argon 40. When they list these figures are they implying that after 1 half-life, of the 50% of the material that decayed to daughter products, 89% of that 50% is Calcium 40 and 11% is Argon 40? </p>

<p>Furthermore, does this mean that those will be the proportions of the daughter products in any given number of half lives?  Is the partitioning of the decay probability to 89% Calcium and 11% Argon  only observed at half-life intervals? Or is this constant throughout the decay chain, such as in between half-lives as well?  It should be constant (89% and 11%) throughout? Right?

"Climate consequences of very large asteroids striking the Deep Ocean","<p>For every asteroid or meteorite that hits dry land, two hit the sea. If a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicouagan_Reservoir#Impact_crater"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manicouagan</a>-sized asteroid struck the deep ocean (but not above a trench),how would the H2O vapour, chlorine, iodine bromine and other elements affect the climate, and for how long? Also, if it had thousands of feet of water to penetrate, would it leave a large crater on the sea bed? For sure it would create massive tsunamis, so is there any evidence for these in the geological record? The Manicouagan crater is far from being the largest on Earth, but is only slightly smaller than the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chicxulub</a> example. It was caused by an asteroid 5km in diameter traveling at 25km per second, though friction with the atmosphere probably reduced this slightly before it struck the ground.</p>

<p>Manicouagan, however, is just an example, we are talking here about a hypothetical asteroid of this size striking the deep ocean. Don't be misled by the word hypothetical; given the number of large impacts which have happened on land there must have been some which landed in deep ocean. How deep?

"How Good is The Evidence For Snowball Earth?","<p>Some geologists say there were times between 770 million years BP and 630 million years BP when ice ages were so profound that the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps met at the equator. This is called the Snowball Earth theory. </p>

<p>Although at the beginning of this period, there were, so far as we know, no advanced invertebrates able to leave easily identifiable fossils, there were by the end of it, so how were they able to thrive and evolve under the ice? There must also have been early marine plants under the ice (there were none on land), so how did they survive? </p>

<p>The main evidence for this glaciation is apparent glacial markings on rocks in S.Africa and Australia, Couldn't there be other explanations for these apparent glacier tracks, apart from Snowball Earth? For example, Australia may have been closer to the S.Pole then, and some of the locations where evidence of glaciers was found might have been much higher above sea level than they are today.</p>

"Relationship between sediment concentration of flow and erosion - streampower equation","<p>I am trying to understand how the sediment concentration of a flow affects erosion.

Namely:</p>

<p>\Omega = Q g S [\rho + C (\sigma - \rho)]</p>

<p>where \Omega is the streampower, Q volumetric flux of the flow, g is gravity, S slope, \rho is the density of the flow, C is the volumetric sediment concentration of the flow, and \sigma is the density of the sediment.</p>

<p>This implies that the Stream power increases with increasing sediment concentration.  I do not understand why this would be the case.  I also haven't yet been able to find this relationship anywhere else to give me more context.</p>

<p>My (rather uninformed) intuition was that erosion would decrease as the flow is carrying more sediment - basically because at some point there has to be a limit to how much sediment a flow can carry and it's still a flowing river/stream etc.  But if streampower increases with increased sediment then I would expect that erosion would also increase (since that is driven by streampower), which is quite a feedback loop (although obviously deposition would also increase so it's not a simple one).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2006, a Columbia University neuroscientist named Stuart J. Firestein, began teaching a course on scientific ignorance after realizing, to his horror, that many of his students might have believed that we understand nearly everything about the brain. ""This crucial element in science was being left out for the students,"" says Firestein.""The undone part of science that gets us into the lab early and keeps us there late, the thing that ""turns your crank,"" the very driving force of science, the exhilaration of the unknown, all this is missing from our classrooms. In short, we are failing to teach the ignorance, the most critical part of the whole operation."" The time has come to ""view ignorance as 'regular' rather than deviant,"" argue sociologists Matthias Gross and Linsey McGoey. Our students will be more curious — and more intelligently so — if, in addition to facts, they were equipped with theories of ignorance as well as theories of knowledge.</p>

<p>This was an MCQ in a recent exam, with only one option being correct:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sea surface temperature are low.</li>
<li>Inter-tropical Convergence Zone seldom occurs.</li>
<li>Coriolis force is too weak.</li>
<li>Absence of land in those regions.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have doubts as:</p>

<p>Sea surface temp are a tad bit lower in those regions. Also, the ITCZ seldom crosses southwards. (Am I wrong?)</p>

<p>Coriolis force is good in 5 degrees to 30-40 degrees. (I think)</p>

<p>Since, there can be only one option true, which one is true?</p>

<p>The fear with the polar bears is that the ice-free period in the bay is getting longer, right?</p>

It was near-record cold as late as ~2/20/15 here but I'm 10-20° south of the bay, I don't know if the cooling effect of the wavy polar vortex extends that far north. It certainly makes the North Arctic warmer.</p>

"Time relativity relating to Carbon dating?","<p>Theoretically if in early years the earth was moving at an astronomically different pace (whether in orbit or rotation, whatever sounds better) wouldn't that alter the science of carbon dating? As I understand time relativity, If the speed at which the earth was moving changes, the elements and organisms there-in would experience time at a different rate.  Would we not expect that carbon would decay faster?  I know it's just theory but I'd like to know if this theory could be proven false. And is there any existing research that you are aware of that would support or debunk this theory?</p>

Due to its elliptical orbit, Earth's distance from the sun changes, but wouldn't the Sun's oscillation affect what parameters this distance shall be over time?</p>

I do not have any background in environmental sciences, but since recently a lot of coverage in the media has been devoted to future droughts in Iran and their socio-economical effects, I got curious enough to investigate the depth of the matter.

By transition, I mainly mean providing a new source of income for the individuals, such that the drought does not translate to unemployment and/or relocation of people. </p>

"Centrifugal Force in the Navier Stokes Equations","<p>The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of nonlinear differential equations that diagnose wind speed and direction. They are (approximately) expressed as $$\frac{d\vec{u}}{dt}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P+f\hat{k}\times\vec{u}-g\hat{k}+\nu \nabla^2\vec{u}$$Where $\frac{d}{dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, $f$ is the coriolis parameter, $\rho$ is density, $P$ is pressure, $g$ is gravity, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\vec{u}$ is the wind vector.</p>

<p>In synoptic meteorology, it is taught that in jet streaks, the curvature of the jet streak influences the acceleration by the centrifugal force. However, in the equation above, I see no centrifugal component.</p>

"Are sand deserts the greatest natural convection heaters on Earth?","<p>Ask any climate scientist the question:  ""Why are deserts so hot in the day time and so cold at night"" and generally you will get the same answer, it’s all about the lack of moisture and latent heat and the greenhouse gas effect.  Consider however for example, a simple household convection heater that uses the principles of:  a radiator, conduction and convection to warm a house.  The radiator fins greatly increase the surface area of the heat source to significantly increase the conduction of heat to the air and the basic concept of convection circulated the warm air upward.  Very efficient, and control is simply to turn the element on and off with a thermostat.  A less used method of control however, but still effective, is simply  to block the fins so conduction and convection is reduced.</p>

<p>Enter Mother Nature, with sand deserts covering vast surfaces of the earth.  Any geologist will tell you that Aeolian sand deposits can have porosities upwards of over 45%, permeability is unlimited and finally the surface area of the sand grains (on and below the surface) for heat conduction is hundreds of times greater than just a flat non porous surface.  The Sahara Desert covers 3.5 million square miles of  Aeolian sand deposits.  The sun supplies the heat to the sand both at the surface and below (surface conduction grain to grain), the sand grains are the radiator fins that conduct heat to the air and finally convection looks after the rest.  Shut off the sun every night and the sand cools very quickly because of the increased conduction and convection soon replaces the hot air with cold.</p>

<p>Most of Europe right now is experiencing a massive heat wave coming from the Sahara Desert to the south and of course blames global warming.  The question is ""Are Sand Deserts The Greatest Natural Convection Heaters On Earth"" and can we control them?  We cannot control the sun, but can we not close some of the fins on these ""desert convection heaters"", perhaps by sealing some of the surfaces of the desert sands with tarps or liquid sealers?  Anything that stops the convection will reduce the heat output.  Has Mother Nature in the past, been playing with the Earth's thermostat simply by reducing and increasing the size of our great deserts?</p>

"Atmospheric conditions needed that blocks all bright light during sunsets and allows you to stare directly at the sun","<p>Today (July 5th, 2019 just before 8 pm KST), along the Han River in Seoul, the <strong>surface of the sun</strong> could be viewed <strong>with my naked eye</strong> <em>(no protection needed)</em>, and this was safe on the eyes. It appeared much redder and it wasn't bright at all. Also, there was no visible ""fog"" that blocked the view of the sun in my vicinity.</p>

<p><strong>I am curious about the conditions needed to create this phenomenon</strong> A possible use-case of an answer could mean the possibility to better predict when I should go view the sunset over the Han River in Seoul. It's beautiful!</p>

<h1>Past Related Topics</h1>

<p><a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/7663/17299"">Why can I look directly at the sun during a sunset but not at noon?</a></p>

<p><strong>This is different from my question</strong> as, while you can still look at it, it is still slightly harmful to your eyes. It can still create some visual artifacts in your vision after you stop staring for even a few seconds.</p>

<p>The sun I saw today at sunset was <strong>not bright at all</strong>. You could stare at the sun for minutes, tens of minutes, etc without any visual impairments. Also, the sun was red in color. </p>

<p>There appears to be at least one more additional condition needed to produce the visual I saw today.</p>

<h1>My Thoughts</h1>

<p>Just to be clear, this seems to go beyond the physics of the <strong>standard sunset</strong>. To me, there seem to be 3 atmospheric conditions that are playing their part in this phenomenon. The first 2 will give you the standard sunset with its beautiful colors. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rayleigh Scattering.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The longer distance light travels along the Horizon.</strong>

<ul>
<li>This enhances Rayleigh Scattering and gives the colors of the sunset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>???</strong>

<ul>
<li>Either this <strong>enhances</strong> Rayleigh Scattering more along the horizon (enhances #2)</li>
<li>Or it's a <strong>separate phenomenon</strong> completely

<ul>
<li>When combined with #1 and #2, allows people to view the surface of the sun without protection!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>More Background Information</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I have seen this phenomenon a few times before in Seoul. </p>

<ul>
<li>Phenomenon never occurred in the US in my hometown for me

<ul>
<li>Hometown is farther north than Seoul. </li>
<li>Harbin, China would be a similar latitude.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I have never seen this phenomenon during the winter.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's possible it has happened, but I didn't see it!</li>
<li>It's only occurred in the Spring and Summer for me.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the afternoon was thicker in air pollution, I believe around sunset the air pollution nearby was much more clear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Around this time (if UTC conversion were correct), there was a thicker air pollution mass around China and the northern part of the Yellow Sea.

<ul>
<li>Sun sets in the West, and any air conditions to the west could affect the sunset.</li>
<li>Is that in line-of-sight? Did the air pollution reach higher in the atmosphere around China? With line-of-sight, that would be around 10 - 60km in the air over the Yellow Sea and China.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>With #1 and #2 directly above, the longer distance that light travels along the horizon during (1) <em>the sunset</em> and (2) <em>the winter in the Northern Hemisphere</em> doesn't seem to play a big part. Otherwise, I should see this a lot in the winter around sunset. I don't, and I never have. </p>

<p>Can air pollution be clear nearby, yet block all the bright light rays farther away?</p>

<h1>Photo</h1>

<p>Here is a photo that can help show the conditions that were present at the time.  Please note that the sun appears much brighter in this picture than it was in-person. The sun was actually really dull red. As you can see, there were clouds, but I am trying to find maps that show the cloud coverage around that time, as I don't believe it was thick.</p>

"How does agriculture release so much greenhouse gas?","<p>I recently came over some numbers of <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/10160/co2-emissions-per-calorie-food"">GHGs released per energy in food produced</a>, and the result is pretty flooring. I can see how animal-based food production is quite inefficient so let's ignore that for now and just look at plants.</p>

<p>For example rice releases 2 kg carbon =  7.6 kg CO2-equivalents per 1000 kcal. This would actually mean that it is more environmentally friendly to drive a car 10 km than to bike 10 km on a rice-based diet, because biking burns around 300 kcal = ~2.28 kg CO2e, while a normal compact car burns 0.5 liters of gasoline <a href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/infographics/range-of-life-cycle-co2/view"" rel=""noreferrer"">= ~1.9  kg CO2e</a>.

None of its answers answer my question. I think it's answer might even have wrong information as I will describe later.</p>

<p>I don't even know very many details of the actual weather patterns on Earth. I would like an answer with a long detailed description of what the whether patterns would be that I can actually understand even if I don't read anything before I read the answer, but not really super long. I would like a summary of what could happen that explains it in a way I can understand. It might be useful because then it will help researchers research whether to look for an Earth like planet in the habitable zone that's tidally locked to its star.</p>

<p>For example, would Earth have any severe weather patterns like a hurricane? According to the YouTube video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVc6S15TFK8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What If the Earth Was Tidally Locked to the Sun?</a>, the pressure on the day side would be a lot lower than the pressure on the night side and create a huge fast storm. I want to know if the pressure difference would really be anything like as big as the pressure difference between the air outside a hurricane and the air in its center. If the answer is yes, does that mean there would be a storm a lot bigger than a hurricane with winds comparable to those of a hurricane? I suspect the answer is no. Earth is a lot bigger than a hurricane so the rate of change of pressure with respect to position would be a lot lower but there's also resistance to the movement of air so I think the wind speed caused by the differential heating between the center of the day side and the edge of the day side would be low. According to <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/4564/how-would-weather-change-on-a-tidally-locked-terrestrial-planet/4608#4608"">this answer</a>, there would be vigorous storms at the edge of the day side. I believe that's incorrect because the edge of the day side is actually only receiving a tiny amount of sunlight per surface area.</p>

<p>Maybe there would be some differential heating of the ocean over much smaller distances than the size of Earth and the differential heating would cause clouds to form over the parts that are heated less by the sun and the clouds would in turn reinforce the differential heating of the ocean over short distances but I think with Earth's much slower rotation rate, the Coriolis force would be much weaker so no hurricanes would form by that process.</p>

"Does the global temperature vary daily (hotter and colder days)?","<p>Earth's current average global temperature <em>(i.e. including hot deserts and cold polar caps)</em> is reported be somewhere between 14°C and 16°C <em>(depending on sources and methods)</em>.</p>

<p>But does it also vary <em>(substantially)</em> on a daily basis ?<br>

<strong>Or</strong> is it exactly the opposite, namely a <strong>zero-sum game</strong>: A hotter-than-average day in – say – Australia inevitably goes along with a colder-than-usual day somewhere else on the planet to make up for the difference, so that the global temperature stays the same from one day to the next (because energy is not <em>created</em> but only <em>transferred</em> from one region to another) ?</p>

<p>As an example, below are the relative temperatures (i.e. colder/hotter than expected/average) for 3 Feb 2014. Would the hotter and colder temperature regions balance out (compensate one another), so that the global temperature on 3 feb 2014 is the same as on 2 feb 2014 and 4 feb 2014 ?</p>

"Would a Biorock formed buiding be suitable for ocean floor research?","<p>Electrodeposition of dissolved minerals in seawater has been used to make coral reef repairs for quite some time. WOLF H. HILBERTZ patented the process and trademarked the name Biorock. I do not have access to IEEE, so I have only been able to read a small portion of this paper:
<a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9015"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9015</a></p>

<p>The author of the article maintained that this process can build a seawall at a third of the cost of concrete, and it was suitable for building underwater constructions. I have only found references to using this process for repairing coral reefs, but none for construction purposes.</p>

<p>If the lower cost and material strength claims are valid, it would seem that this process would make it dramatically cheaper to build buildings at depth that could be used to make oceanic research facilities.</p>

<p>Is this a feasible approach to build ocean floor facilities for research or commercial purposes? Does the material formed have low enough porosity to be used as a building exterior wall?</p>

"Geological feature - what is it?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnrQw.jpg"" alt=""feature"">
Hello,</p>

<p>We were walking in Bundoran in Donegal County, Ireland today and we encountered the geological feature shown in the picture (from above from cliffs and from very close up at beach level). We have three questions about it?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How would you call it? It looks to me like the tall rocks on the sides are sea stacks but isn’t the eroded bit in the middle more like a sea stump? Or are they something different altogether?</p></li>
<li><p>What type of rock is it (in the close-up pics) Our guess is that it is shale, but it could also be limestone. Which one do you think it is?</p></li>
<li><p>Please notice the ubiquitous fossils in the close-ups. Are we correct to think they are crinoids?</p></li>

"The apparent path of the sun","<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20150905054450/http://www.act.org/qotd/"" rel=""nofollow"">An American College Test sample question asks:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the shadow directions in these experiments, which of the following best describes the difference between the apparent path of the Sun as seen from the observation points in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A.</strong> The Sun travels a more southerly path in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong> The Sun travels a more northerly path in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><strong>C.</strong> The Sun rises in the East and sets in the West in the Northern Hemisphere, but the opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><strong>D.</strong> The Sun rises in the West and sets in the East in the Northern Hemisphere, but the opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>I've read the explanation for B several times. I don't understand the meaning of ""traveling a more northerly path"" in the southern hemisphere. Does the alignment of the compass and the shadow show the reverse direction in which the sun is traveling? (In this case, since 9 of the 15 directions recorded pointed South, the compass directions were aligned to point North.) </p>

"Is global warming being moderated by latent heat of melting polar ice?","<p>I've only had a secondary education in physics, so bear with me, but with the greenhouse effect and all, wouldn't we be much hotter already if the ice melt-rate wasn't increasing, since more (heat) energy goes toward changing state, rather than changing temperature? My understanding of latent heat is that it is the applied heat that does not result in a dramatic temperature increase, rather it is used to change state (i.e. solid ice to liquid water).</p>

<p>The obvious issue would be that once the ice is all melted, or it doesn't melt quick enough, we'll have proper heat problems (not just the 2 or 4 or 6 deg changes being discussed now).</p>

<p>Are there numbers available on this? Or is this effect nonsense? Or am I looking towards a time a few orders of magnitude beyond my years?</p>

"Paper result validation and the scientific method in earth science","<p>The context of this question is computational earth science specifically meteorology/climatology but I am sure it applies to all the scientific disciplines where numerical methods are used.</p>

<p>Recently I had asked the author of a peer reviewed paper for the software that was used in the publication of his paper. He not only  immediately provided the software but also gave me test data to verify the results of his paper. The same was done by a climate change institute affiliated to NOAA. They gave me their software and asked me to download the relevant data from the NOAA site to validate their conclusions and perhaps reuse their software for solving my problems. In both these cases the only requirement was that the software had to be cited in any paper that I publish in the future.</p>

<p>These two instances are not the problem. In another couple of cases when I asked the authors of the peer reviewed paper for their software to validate their work they refused claiming that is ""private"". My questions are therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which one of these two  occurrences is more common in meteorology/climatology?</li>
<li>As somebody who is originally from a CS background (where code reviews are extremely common) I'm curious what is the current standard of reproducibility in meteorology/climatology?</li>

"Why do winter temperatures account for most of the increase in global temperature?","<p>If you examine the detailed temperature records that form the basis for our understanding of global warming, there are some strange anomalies (at least from a naive point of view where warming affects everywhere equally).</p>

<p>For example, by far the largest temperature increases are confined to winter months in the northern hemisphere. As <a href=""http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=6768"">one commentator has it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winter months in the Northern Hemisphere are responsible for most of the observed land warming in CRUTEM4.  The summer months (June, July, August, September) essentially show no warming at all from 1850 to 1990. Overall,  NH winters have warmed about twice as much as  NH summers.</p>
  
  <p>...The same exercise for the southern hemisphere shows very little difference where of course the seasonal months  are inverted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a sensible explanation of this effect? Is it reproduced, for example, in climate models?</p>
"
"Does the regional localisation of global temperature trends suggest contamination by urban development?","<p>Much of the raw data behind the various datasets reporting the average temperature of the world are now available. So it is possible to look for strange patterns in the daily or monthly temperature data. The reported ""average temperature of the world"" is, ultimately, derived from these datasets by various corrections, normalisations and regional aggregations.</p>

<p>Recently I came across a claim that the temperature anomalies are remarkably concentrated geographically. The hypothesis suggested, tentatively, by the author (Clive Best, <a href=""http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=3338"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog on topic here</a>) suggested that this might reflect contamination of the raw data by rapid urbanisation. NB his argument is very different from the idea that US data is corrupted by the urban heat island effect which is addressed here: <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10341/has-the-urban-heat-island-effect-on-the-us-temperature-record-been-underestimate"">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10341/has-the-urban-heat-island-effect-on-the-us-temperature-record-been-underestimate</a>)</p>

<p>He reports (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The anomalies from ~4000 stations all over the globe are then combined to give one  global anomaly, yielding  the familiar graph we know and love which shows ~0.6 deg.C rise since 1850. Looking in more detail however we discover that <em>some parts of the world are not warming at all and some  are  even cooling.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His argument develops:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It immediately becomes obvious  that  the bulk of  observed warming is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere : Eastern Europe, Russia, central Asia, India, China, Japan, Middle East, North Africa. These are all areas of rapid population increase, development and industrialisation. There is essentially no warming at all in the Southern Hemisphere. Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay and Argentina all appear to be cooling. Even Australia and Zealand are static or  cooling. The US is evenly divided and the UK shows essentially no signal at all.</p>
  
  <p>...Could much of the observed temperature rise over  the last 6 decades  be simply due to increasing urbanisation and development since ~1960 ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Climate models don't produce even warming across the world so there could be explanations perfectly consistent with the observations of major regional differences. So my question is: does the large variation in regional temperature anomalies have a straightforward explanation in mainstream warming theory or is it a sign that some regional records are contaminated by urban development?</p>

"What meteorological factors contribute to springtime Trans-Pacific air-pollution events?","<p>The transport of tropospheric ozone, ozone precursors, carbon monoxide, etc from Asia to North America is an active area of research (see <a href=""http://www.atmos.washington.edu/jaffegroup/publications/2011AmbroseJaffeHighO3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">J.L. Ambrose, et al., 2011</a>)  These types of events occur rather dramatically in the springtime, apparently due to meteorological conditions when westerly winds are strong, which carries polluted air across the Pacific.  Stratospheric ozone events can be differentiated because they have low moisture and no associated increase in carbon monoxide.  </p>

<p>What meteorological factors contribute to the increased transport of Asia-generated air pollution to North America?

"Why a stratus cloud does not always reach all the way to the ground?","<p>The surface of the ground at night cools down because of outgoing long-wave radiation. In my understanding the cooling of the surface also causes cooling of the adjacent air. If the air contains enough water vapor, dropping of the temperature causes condensation of liquid water droplets and formation of fog.</p>

<p>In my region (Central Europe near 50°N) in winter, stratus clouds can be observed much more often than fog. Typically the base of the stratus cloud is 100 meters or higher above ground surface and the thickness of the stratus is several hundred meters. What puzzles me is the ""empty"" layer between the ground surface and the cloud base. Why does the stratus cloud often not reach all the way to the ground? What factors determine the stratus cloud base height?</p>

"Present results as log data","<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question, but here goes...</p>

<p>I'm reviewing literature regarding effectiveness of wastewater treatment techniques. When considering faecal coliforms concentrations are generally presented in terms of most probable number per volume or per mass, typically MPN/100mL or MPN/g. Due to the scales involved these are often in scientific notation.
The reduction in concentration due to treatment is then presented as a log factor, i.e. reduction from $6\times10^{10}MPN/100mL$ to $3\times10^{4}MPN/100mL$ is hence $log(2\times10^{6}) = 6.30$.</p>

<p>One paper that I'm reading presents the following (amongst several similar examples):</p>

<pre><code>influent Faecal coliform conc. = 
</code></pre>

<p>$1.43\times10^{5.1}\pm0.6\times10^{0.25}MPN/100mL$ <br></p>

<pre><code>effluent Faecal coliform conc. = 
</code></pre>

<p>$5.1\times10^{2.5}\pm3.7\times10^{0.7}MPN/100mL$ <br></p>

<pre><code>resultant log reduction = 2.18
</code></pre>

<p>1: Has anyone encountered data presented like this before?</p>

<p>2: Is there some way of calculating reduction that results in 2.18 (I get 2.05)?</p>

The particulate dust from volcanic activity (more active back then) accumulated in the stratosphere, reflecting solar heat and light back into space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract—Recent studies have shown that, in addition to the role of
  solar variability, past climate changes may have been connected with
  variations in the Earth’s magnetic field elements at various
  timescales. An analysis of variations in geomagnetic field elements,
  such as field intensity, reversals, and excursions, allowed us to
  establish a link between climate changes at various timescales over
  the last millennia. Of particular interest are sharp changes in the
  geomagnetic field intensity and short reversals of the magnetic poles
  (excursions). The beginning and termination of the examined
  geomagnetic excursions can be attributed to periods of climate change.
  In this study, we analyzed the possible link between short-term
  geomagnetic variability (jerks) and climate change, as well as the
  accelerated drift of the north magnetic pole and surface temperature
  variations. The results do not rule out the possibility that
  geomagnetic field variations which modulate the cosmic ray flux could
  have played a major role in climate change in addition to previously
  induced by solar radiation.</p>

<p>Gyre-driven decay of the Earth’s magnetic dipole</p>

<p>Christopher C. Finlay1, Julien Aubert2 &amp; Nicolas Gillet3</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Direct observations indicate that the magnitude of the Earth’s
  magnetic axial dipole has decreased over the past 175 years; it is now
  9% weaker than it was in 1840. Here we show how the rate of dipole
  decay may be controlled by a planetary-scale gyre in the liquid metal
  outer core. The gyre’s meridional limbs on average transport normal
  polarity magnetic flux equatorward and reverse polarity flux poleward.
  Asymmetry in the geomagnetic field, due to the South Atlantic Anomaly,
  is essential to the proposed mechanism. We find that meridional flux
  advection accounts for the majority of the dipole decay since 1840,
  especially during times of rapid decline, with magnetic diffusion
  making an almost steady contribution generally of smaller magnitude.
  Based on the morphology of the present field, and the persistent
  nature of the gyre, the current episode of dipole decay looks set to
  continue, at least for the next few decades</p>

Cities in Florida, Texas, and other affected areas are struggling to hire enough trucks and drivers to pick it up quickly.  But aside from that, I noticed many of the areas have started to <a href=""https://www.volusia.org/services/public-protection/emergency-management/pin/debris.stml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">burn</a> the debris once it starts building up.</p>

<p>Got to wondering... typically mulch comes in modestly pricey, and when free mulch is offered, it often goes quickly.</p>

<p>So assuming a fair portion of debris is mulchable and is of interest to other areas, and that we can acquire typical transportation resources, then we'll set up transfer from collection sites to those other regions rather than burning it.  What would be the net pollution result?</p>

<p>If <strong>removed for mulch and such</strong>: trucking pollution + decomposition (- trees saved locally??)<br>
If <strong>burned</strong>: the burning pollution.</p>

<p>Obviously it's about approximation rather than exacts, it's probably hard to appraise the different byproducts from burning versus decomposition, and a lot probably depends upon the way it is burned.  But as a whole, can we get a rough estimate of comparable quantities/damage done... is it less pollution/damage even to truck it an average of 3000 miles?  1000 miles?  100 miles?  10 miles?  Should it be burned on the spot (if done safely)?  Would think there's got to be some way to get a very rough idea.</p>

<p>Certainly the best option if viable might be leaving it in place to decompose.  But considering how upset people are getting at having debris around these parts a month later, exclude that option from the possibilities.</p>

"Geomorphology of Mountains With Wind only Erosion","<p>I am curious what mountains would look like if erosion occurred almost entirely by wind. Specifically, I am curious of how <strong><em>granite</em></strong> mountains would look on a ""snowball"" terrestrial-sized xenoplanet. </p>

<p>On a ""snowball"" world, the planet is earth sized and retains water but it lies outside its sun's ""goldilocks zone"" and is to cold for liquid water. Ocean's freeze over to a deep of several kilometers with only deep pockets kept liquid by concentrated minerals and vulcanism. </p>

<p>With no liquid water there will be no liquid erosion and no ice fracturing. The only moisture at all in the air will come from sublimation so very little ice will be deposited at altitude and it likely won't form glaciers or otherwise contribute to erosion. </p>

<p>At lower altitudes, very slow moving glaciers will probably perform most erosion but at altitude it will be erosion from wind carrying water and CO2 crystals as an abrasive. </p>

<p>On Earth, erosion from water causes convex (wide rock, narrow erosion channel) while glaciers causes concave (narrow rock, wide erosion channel.) Hard brittle rock such as granite suffers ice fracturing leaving a jagged vertical channels with overall angular features. </p>

<p>In dry areas on Earth erosion creates rounded, fluid structures like stones shaped by a stream. But I am unclear of how much that is a feature of wind erosion and how much a feature of softer sedimentary stones. It looks like Mars, where erosion is primarily wind driven, does have more rounded and less jagged mountains than on Earth but I don't know about the suspected composition of the those mountains. </p>

<p>If granite wears from the wind, does it round off or does it's internal structure cause it to fracture even without water? </p>

"Weight vs. Mass of Clouds","<p>I came across a statement online that said that an average cloud has a weight of 1 million pounds. My main question is, does a cloud actually have <em>weight</em> on Earth or was the term ""weight"" a colloquial expression meaning ""mass""?</p>

<p>From my understanding, weight is a force defined as W = mass × gravity, or essentially F = ma. Because the cloud is not falling, its acceleration is 0 -- that is, the acceleration of -9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> exerted by Earth's gravity must be counteracted by another equal and opposite force in order for the cloud to be stationary in mid-air, hence the ""a"" portion of F=ma is 0, so F, and therefore weight, must be 0. Is this thinking correct?</p>

<p>However, when the state changes from gas to liquid -- that is, when it starts raining - the water molecules in the liquid state obviously have weight. So my secondary question is, does a molecule's state change affect its weight? For gases which are ""lighter than air"", is their weight negative? (I suspect yes because of the force equation).</p>

<p>There are another group of models that use a <strong><em>hydrostatic</em></strong> solver by default (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/modelling-and-prediction/atmospheric-dynamics"">ECMWF</a>), and presumably make the following assumption about the Earth's atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Hydrostatic equilibrium describes the atmospheric state in which the upward directed pressure gradient force (the decrease of pressure with height) is balanced by the downward-directed gravitational pull of the Earth. On average the Earth’s atmosphere is always close to hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>

<p>My question is what are the applications of each type of solver, i.e. when would you chose to use a non-hydrostatic model over a hydrostatic one? (which is presumably less computationally expensive?)</p>

"The river or the hills; which came first?","<p>On the upper Mississippi in Illinois and southern Wisconsin, the river is bounded by hills and bluffs which  define the outer edges of the flood plain. There are similar configurations for some of  its tributaries, specifically the Illinois, the Rock and the Wisconsin Rivers.</p>

"What would the geology and climate of a supposed landmass near the pole be like, assuming a thoroughly warmer planet?","<p>I am designing a fantasy setting for pen-and-paper role-playing (and potential novel) purposes. I have decided that a continent be situated right on a Pole of some imaginary planet with axial tilt comparable to Earth. My question is: is it possible to achieve environmental conditions in the Continent at least somewhat similar to those of current-day Europe?</p>

<p>My understanding of Earth climate is that the poles, while extremely cold, are also very dry in terms of precipitation. I have understood that this is mostly due to the axial tilt but I'm not sure. I have heard that in a warmer part of Earth's history the poles had vegetation - is this possible even with the ever-present high-pressure zone?</p>

<p>I guess one way the continent could be habitable is to be full of freshwater rivers, originating from glaciers high atop of some mountains. I guess such mountains are plausible near the pole (I don't think the movement and mutual interaction of continental plates are somehow dependent of the latitude, are they?)</p>

"Calculating Monthly Accumulation value of the Clearness Index KT","<p>I have an hourly data file of a particular location which contains the following variables (extracted from the Meteonorm7.0 data base, for a typical one year of data):</p>

<li><strong>GlobHor (W/m<sup>2</sup>)</strong>: Horizontal Global Radiation.</li>
<li><strong>DiffHor (W/m<sup>2</sup>)</strong>: Horizontal Diffuse Radiation.</li>
<li><strong>KT</strong>: Clearness Index.</li>
<li><strong>Tamb (°C)</strong>: Ambient temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>I´ve received the Monthly Accumulation values for each variable and I tried to check such values using just the hourly data. The Monthly Accumulation values of GlobHor and DiffHor are in kWh/m<sup>2</sup>.month units.</p>

<p>For the radiation variables, I´ve done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've multiplied each hourly W/m<sup>2</sup> value by the number of seconds in an hour (3600).</li>
<li>Sum all the values in W/m<sup>2</sup> for each month.</li>
<li>Divide each monthly value by (3.6×1000000)</li>

"How far can water wick up above the capillary fringe in sediment or soil?","<p>The capillary fringe is the area above the water table where the water is held in tension so that the connected pore space is completely saturated, although variation in pore size means that there is variability in the height of capillary rise, and thus, the thickness of the capillary fringe can include a zone where the largest pores are not saturated (a number of workers only consider the zone where all pores are saturated as the capillary fringe). The capillary fringe can be several meters thick in clays. Above the capillary fringe, there is a zone of variable water saturation called the vadose zone where water is held in tension but the pores are not fully saturated. </p>

<p>Can water wick up into the vadose zone from the capillary fringe to any significant distance (say more than a cm or so) and to any significant amount?

"Tsunami - Mathematical classification","<p>I'm interested in knowing which type of wave a tsunami is, in a strictly mathematical sense.  </p>

<p>I'm gonna cite from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). Its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometres (12 mi) and its amplitude grows enormously – in accord with Green's law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not break, but rather appears like a fast-moving tidal bore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the first property strongly hints at a tsunami being a shallow water wave, the latter fact, namely that they usually don't break would rather suggest for the tsunami being a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton"" rel=""noreferrer"">soliton-solution</a> of a Korteveeg-de-Vries-type equation.<br>
I thought the latter property would not be inherent to shallow water waves although <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia, again</a> seems to argue differently, however only with a picture.</p>

"Connections between marine and terrestrial ecosystems","<p>First I would like to note that I have only very basic understanding of ecology, biology and paleontology so I can easily miss something very simple.</p>

<p>I can envision certain ways marine and terrestrial ecosystems influence each other:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rivers and surface runoff carries minerals, soil, plants, excrements etc into the oceans. Productive terrestrial ecosystem would mean less minerals, more organic nutrients going into the ocean.</li>
<li>Terrestrial animals (like birds) eat marine ones and then excrete and are eaten at the land.</li>
<li>Marine and terrestrial ecosystems absorb and produce atmospheric $O_2$, $CO_2$, $N_2$ that are redistributed globally by atmospheric movements. That also affects climate and therefore water cycle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Naively it seems to me that the situation is quite asymmetric. While №2 should be of extreme importance to the coastal ecosystems I suppose it's influence drops quickly as you go deeper into continent aggravated by water currents taking everything back into ocean. So (again naively) it seems to me that marine ecosystems should be much more influenced by the terrestrial ones than the other way around.</p>

<p>So imagine sudden significant drop of primary production for some reason constrained to the oceans. Obviously it would be a catastrophe for island and coastal life but in what ways, how much and at what timescale it will affect inland ecosystems? What if we turn it upside down and consider some significant drop of terrestrial primary production?</p>

<p>Notice the clear distinction between the ""carved land"" and the vegetation to the south and west, this is one of the traits I find confusing about this structure.</p>

<p>I tried researching the park to see if there is a scientifically accepted origin for this formation, but all I learned is that it is apparently made from sandstone, and the region is noted for being very rugged. </p>

<p>I'm not a geologist, so I might be missing some important info that could help, but I have at least a basic understanding of geology from a few electives I've taken in college. I know that glaciers carve up the land, and when they retreat, they leave behind a mess of jagged rocks and lakes that are aligned in the direction of flow of the former glacier. The above picture seems to show just that: there is a clear sense of direction of the lakes and rocks. </p>

<p>Additionally, I was able to find one other similar formation about 400km (~250 miles) north east up the Australian coast (measured as a straight line) near the Sir Charles Hardy Islands. I would show a pic of that as well, but I'm limited because I'm new here.</p>

<p>Other than these two formations, I was unable to find any other examples. Both formations highly contrast their surroundings and both seem to be ""smeared"" in roughly the same direction.</p>

<p>For reference, look closely at the land in northern Canada and Europe, where glaciers are known to have existed geologically recently. (Again, I had pics but I can't post them.)</p>

I'm not sure if the title is a bit sensational or not, the crack is in an ice shelf, not the continent of Antarctica.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An ominous crack in an Antarctic ice shelf as wide as a football field is long takes on an otherworldly beauty in a new aerial image.</p>
  
  <p>Snapped by scientists on NASA's IceBridge mission, the shot shows a rift in Larsen C, an ice shelf that is floating off the Antarctic Peninsula. When the crack eventually spreads across the entire ice shelf, it will create an iceberg the size of the state of Delaware, according to IceBridge. That's around 2,491 square miles (6,451 square kilometers).</p>
  
  <p>As of Nov. 10, when the IceBridge scientists observed this crack, it was 70 miles (112 km) long and more than 300 feet (91 meters) wide. The dark depths of the crack plunge down about a third of a mile (0.5 km), all the way through the ice to the ocean below.</p>
  
  <p>[...] Larsen C is Antarctica's fourth-largest ice shelf, and it holds back the land-based glaciers just behind it: Once the ice shelf goes, those slow-flowing glaciers have one less barrier in their journey toward the sea.</p>

"What rate of deforestation would be needed until we run out of oxygen?","<p>I was wondering about how much unchecked deforestation would have to occur before we tipped the balance and started using more oxygen than was being replenished by plants and trees.</p>

<p>Last I heard it was estimated that every day an area the size of Wales was being removed globally which sounds like a very large amount. This could be inaccurate now as it was a long time ago. Many companies now plant trees to offset carbon footprint or whatever but assuming they didn't how long would we have?</p>

<p>My question could be reduced to this - what area of land would need to be covered by forest to sustain life on earth without us all suffocating?</p>

<p>I imagine that this is a very simplistic view, it would probably cause global warming to accelerate first or the ecosystem to collapse and we'd all starve. I should say at this point that I am no scientist!</p>

"In quasi-geostrophic frontogenesis, what happens if the potential vorticity is negative?","<p>In particular, what happens if the Sawyer–Eliassen equation cannot be solved? I know that a condition for the Sawyer–Eliassen equation to have a solution is $F^2 N^2 - S^4 &gt;0$, which means that the potential vorticity is positive.</p>

<p>I was wondering what is the physical implication of this condition on frontogenesis? Are there situations where fronts cannot be created, when potential vorticity is negative? Does that occur somewhere?</p>

<p>A secondary question would be the link with symmetric instability, which requires if I am not mistaken that the absolute vorticity (which is more or less potential vorticity) must be negative (in the northern hemisphere). I do not understand, then, how symmetric instability can arise when the Sawyer–Eliassen equation can be solved. Instability should occur in fronts since it is the driving phenomenon for the creation of precipitation bands!</p>

<p>Many articles on Homo floresiensis also discuss how the remains were originally dated to ~12,000 years ago, but that this estimate was later revised to 60–100,000 years ago. However, everything I can find indicates that mostly geological dating methods were used, not radiometric dating.</p>

<p>Why not? The Wikipedia entry on carbon dating says that it can only be used reliably to date specimens up to ~50,000 years, but could carbon dating then at least place a lower limit on the age of these remains? And why wouldn't it have been used back when they thought the specimens were only ~12,000 years old?</p>

"Does subduction of continental crust happen at continental-continental convergent boundaries?","<p>What exactly happens at a continental-continental (cc) convergent boundary? I read myself through the web for the last few days and what I came up with is that such a boundary will start as an oceanic-continental (oc) one until the continental plates meet and then a huge falt mountain range like the Himalaja, Alps or Appalacian Mountains is formed.</p>

<p>At this point the sources I found gave me conflicting information. Either no subduction of the continental plate occurs or the continental plate is subducted and melts somewhere around 90 to 140 km down. Apparently rockes which where once part of the continental plate melt and resurface. I also heard that this is an area of ongoing research and it isn't fully understood what happens at cc convergent boundaries. So... </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does no subduction of the continental plate occur? </p></li>
<li><p>Does only a bit of subduction of the continental plate occur, as some of it is pulled down into the deep by the rest of the oceanic plate? </p></li>
<li><p>Does subduction occur at cc boundaries as on oo and oc boundaries, just slower and in a more quiet manner and cc boundaries usually don't last long enough?</p></li>

"What portion of global warming is caused by radioactive CO2 produced from cosmic rays?","<p>The Earth's magentic field has been weaking recently, and the sun's magnetic field has been weaking recently, and it is a known fact that when either of these magnetic fields weaken (let alone both of them at the same time) that more cosmic rays reach the Earth - and indeed, throughout the past several decades there has been a continuously-increasing quantity of cosmic rays reaching the Earth - and it is also a known fact that cosmic rays produce C02, and that C02 causes global warming. So how do we know whether or not a huge portion of global warming is being caused by the C02-producing cosmic rays rather than human activitis? Obviously human activities do produce some amount of C02, but has an effort been made to determine how much of a contributor this is, compared to the C02 from cosmic rays?</p>

<p>I tried Googling for stuff like ""do cosmic rays cause global warming"" but the only results I am finding are things which discuss some theory about cosmic rays seeding clouds (Henrik Svensmark's theory), which is <em>not</em> what I am referring to. I could not find a single article that discusses - or tries to debunk - the possibility of global warming being caused by the C02-producing cosmic rays. There might be one somewhere in the search results, but I only have so much time that I am willing to spend digging through Google. Does anyone have an argument against this theory?</p>

"I'm still confused about what ""probability of precipitation"" means","<p>I'm trying to understand what weather forecasts mean more precisely. As I understand it from reading Wikipedia, blogs, etc., the percentage value for rain/precipitation that you see in a forecast is technically called the ""probability of precipitation"". To quote the National Weather Service webpage:</p>

<p>""Mathematically, PoP is defined as follows: PoP = C x A where ""C"" = the confidence that precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area, and where ""A"" = the percent of the area that will receive measureable precipitation, if it occurs at all.
So... in the case of the forecast above, if the forecaster knows precipitation is sure to occur ( confidence is 100% ), he/she is expressing how much of the area will receive measurable rain. ( PoP = ""C"" x ""A"" or ""1"" times "".4"" which equals .4 or 40%.)""</p>

<p>This definition does not seem well stated to me, for the reason that ""confidence"" is (presumably) not uniform across an area. For instance, the phrase ""how much of the area <strong>will</strong> receive measurable rain"" seems odd, since a forecast would (presumably) only be able to give a probabilistic estimate for this area. </p>

<p>Let's cook up an example. Consider a town (the forecast area) consisting of two parts of equal area (called north side and south side). Each point in the north side will be rained on with 100% probability tomorrow, and each point in the south side will be rained on with 50% probability (at every point) tomorrow. What is the PoP in this example? At face value, the definition could be interpreted as implying that the PoP is 100%, since precipitation will occur <strong>somewhere</strong> in the forecast area. However, this value seems intuitively unsatisfying, since some people might not get any rain.  </p>

<p>Here's what I might expect a more precise definition to be. If <span class=""math-container"">$A$</span> is the area and <span class=""math-container"">$C(x)$</span> is the ""pointwise confidence function"" depending on a point (location) <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span>, then define 
<span class=""math-container"">$$PoP = \frac{1}{area(A)}\int_{A} C(x)\, dx.$$</span>
In words, this is just the expected value of <span class=""math-container"">$C(x)$</span>, or the probability that a randomly located person would see rain over the specified time interval. In practice, of course the integral would be estimated based on actual measurement sites. If such a formula is indeed an accurate definition, then I'd be satisfied. In the above example, the PoP would be 75%. (The official definition could in essence be viewed as a shorthand that is more useful for those without any background in calculus.) If this definition is not correct, then some explanation would be helpful.</p>

<p>I've read web articles with statements like the <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/what-it-really-means-when-theres-a-50-percent-chance-of-1785465340"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">following</a>: ""As a student and observer of meteorology, it constantly bums me out that people do not understand what it means when someone says there’s an “X% chance of rain” tomorrow. A 50 percent chance of rain does not mean there’s a 1-in-2 chance that you’re going to get wet.""</p>

<p>It's not clear to me why ""A 50 percent chance of rain means there’s a 1-in-2 chance that you’re going to get wet"" would be an inaccurate interpretation of PoP. If the definition I suggested above is correct, then it is perfectly correct to say that a stationary observer placed at a random location in this scenario would have a 50% chance of getting wet. Am I missing something, or is this author being careless?</p>

<p>I don't have any background in meteorology, and in particular I don't have much of a sense of how PoP is actually computed in practice.</p>

"Why did notosuchians and similar crocodylomorphs thrive in the Jurassic-Cretaceous but fail to compete with adequate mammalian competitors?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notosuchia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Notosuchia</a> has a long and storied past. They seem to have gotten by just fine with dinosaurs dominating the makeup of mid and late Mesozoic megafauna. Despite dinosaurs having more developed and specialized anatomy, notosuchians thrived with diversity of their own.</p>

<p>Most importantly, many of these are large, terrestrial, cursorial carnivores -- exactly the niche of the more established dinosaurs. This obvious competition does not seem to have fazed notosuchian diversity.</p>

<p>Notosuchians survived the K-Pg extinction event with Sebecosuchia. Together with the unrelated mekosuchines, long-legged terrestrial crocodylomorphs managed to eke out an existence for a few more tens of millions of years. However, they only thrived in areas with no significant mammalian carnivorous megafauna - pre-Interchange South America, Australia and Oceanic islands, mainly.</p>

<p>For some reason, the ecological advantages that allowed terrestrial crocodilians to coexist with dinosaurs and terror birds did not apply in the middle Miocene.</p>

<p>Since this era is also the one where large, competent mammalian predators had evolved, this implies that they were able to confine the notosuchians and mekosuchines to more specific areas and niches until they eventually went extinct.</p>

<p>Of course the climate of the Miocene was much different from that of the Mesozoic, I just don't know how that applies.</p>

<p>I feel like there's something missing here. I understand that the denser material will sink in more. But how does this affect earth's outer shape?

"Are clouds more common at night?","<p>Clouds obviously have a strong effect on surface temperatures. By blocking sunlight they can decrease the temperature by several degrees. At night they have a blanket effect that traps warm air and can increase nighttime temperatures.</p>

This might also be different between low altitude and high altitude clouds. </p>

<p>The articles I read are also not clear on whether clouds, currently, have a net warming or cooling effect. Is there any consensus on which is true?

<p>I took the <span class=""math-container"">$ln(\tau) = ln(\frac{k_νrp}{g})$</span> </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$ln(\tau) = ln(k_ν) + ln(r) + ln(p) - ln(g)$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$dln(\tau) = dln(k_ν) + dln(r) + dln(p) - dln(g)$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{dln\tau}{\tau} = \frac{dlnk_ν}{k_v} + \frac{dlnr}{r} + \frac{dlnp}{p} - \frac{dlng}{g}$</span></p>

<p>We will assume that <span class=""math-container"">$g$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$k_v$</span> are constant, so disregard for a moment here.  It is a battle between the mixing ratio <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$p$</span>.  </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\frac{dln\tau}{\tau} = \frac{dlnr}{r} + \frac{dlnp}{p}$</span></p>

<p>If we want to know if peak <span class=""math-container"">$\tau$</span> moves up or down, I say that <span class=""math-container"">$\tau$</span> is constant.  If I increase the mixing ratio <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span> (increase <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> concentration in atmosphere), pressure must decrease in order to keep <span class=""math-container"">$\tau$</span> constant, and decreased pressure means moving up in altitude.  I conclude that increasing <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> concentrations shifted the emission level to a higher altitude.</p>

<p><strong>Help</strong></p>

<p>I am unsure how to arrive at the initial given equation.  My understanding of <span class=""math-container"">$\tau$</span> is minimal, and I just see too many variations and integrals concerning <span class=""math-container"">$\tau$</span>.  I see how the Ideal Gas Law and the Hypsometric Relation will be used to replace variables </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$ρ = ρ_o*e^\frac{-z}{H}$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$H = \frac{RT}{g}$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$P = ρRT$</span></p>

<p>(just trying to work backwards and piece the puzzle together, but the vision is unclear), but what was the original equation that was used, and ultimately--why?</p>

"What's the difference between ""loading"" and ""receiving"" in water quality modeling?","<p>I see some models described as simulating 'receiving water quality' and others as 'pollutant loading' models. <strong>What is the difference between loading and receiving models in this context?</strong></p>

<p>I am more familiar with the 'pollutant loading' term because of its more widespread use, e.g. predicting pollutant loads, Total Maximum Daily Loads, EMC * flow = load. In this sense, loading is the buildup of pollutants which will flow out of a given area.</p>

<p>Given that my description of loading sounds like 'edge of field' pollution estimates, e.g. the amount of pollutants leaving the field but not necessarily how much pollutant will arrive at a downstream outlet, would receiving water quality models be predicting the 'at the outlet' pollution? Or, what a point downstream will receive based on phenomenon upstream?</p>

<p>If my description of a receiving model is correct, it sounds like loading and receiving is somewhat a matter of perspective. If I model Delaware River Basin and estimate pollution flowing out of it, that's a loading model, but if I have a receiving model of the Delaware Bay, isn't that the same thing? Are receiving models more focused on simulating pollutant transformations and in-river processes?</p>

"Over which surface will the albedo changes due to clear and overcast skies have the greatest impact?","<p>With respect to climate change, will the changes in albedos due to clear skies and overcast skies have the greatest impact on incoming solar radiation over ocean, sea ice, or land?</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<p>On a scale, the ocean has the lowest albedo, nearing on 0, land is much higher with an average of 0.3, and sea ice has the greatest with average of 0.6.  Since the oceans absorb almost all the incoming radiation, an increase in cloud cover will greatly change the albedo, since clouds tend toward 1, and much less energy will be absorbed.  Looking at sea ice, it already reflects 60%, adding clouds with similar albedos, the change won’t be much.</p>

"Is this a contradiction in Wikipedia's definition of temperate zone?","<p>Under the Wikipedia article Temperate climate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Temperate climate</a> in the introduction is describes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In geography, the temperate or tepid climates of Earth occur in the
  middle latitudes, which span between the tropics and the polar regions
  of Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0CMF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0CMF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So by this sentence I take the temperate zone to be between the pink shaded area (the tropics, and the uppermost and lowermost broken lines (arctic and antarctic circles. This is simple enough.</p>

<p>Then in the next paragraph it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The temperate zones (latitudes from 35° to the polar circles at about
  66.5°, north and south) are where the widest seasonal changes occur, with most climates found in it having somewhat balanced influence from
  both the tropics and the poles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now it says that the temperate zones are between latitudes about 35 degrees from the equator to the polar circles. This is different than the earlier description, which said it was between the tropics and the polar circles, which is about +- 23.5 degrees to the polar circles, not 35 degrees.</p>

<p>A little lower it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The north temperate zone extends from (approximately 23.5° north) to
  the Arctic Circle (approximately 66.5° north latitude). The south
  temperate zone extends from (approximately 23.5° south) to the
  Antarctic Circle (at approximately 66.5° south).<br> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate#Zones_and_climates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zones and
  climates</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now it's saying again the temperate zone is between the tropics (23.5 degrees latitude) to the polar circles.</p>

<p>Lower again it specifies that there is a suptropical zone, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subtropical climates are generally located between 23.5° and 35° north
  or south on the eastern or leeward sides of landmasses.
  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate#Humid_subtropical_climates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Humid subtropical climates</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's now specifying zones of the subtropics, but it doesn't change the fact that in the first instance it says the the temperate zone is between the tropics, +/- 23.5 degrees, and the polar circles, and then says the temperate zone is between 35 degrees to the polar circles, a definition which excludes the subtropics from the temperate zone. </p>

"Is it possible that the recent droughts are signs of epic crust failure?","<p>The full question is: Is it possible that the recent, successive, long droughts from Australia to the West Coast of both American continents are signs of epic crust failure?</p>

<p>The question is aimed specifically at the possible link between droughts at those specific areas and the weakening/loosening of lateral stress between tectonic plates.</p>

<p>The reasoning is based on the following observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The crust is not rooted in the mantle, and is cut in numerous crustal plates. Tectonic plates are held in place like an arch, so the gravity and lateral stress and friction are the main forces holding them up. Mantle flow provides uneven support to continental plates and is actually the main destabilizing force according to current theories.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the idea above, if humans dig up too much underground materials around the fault lines, the edges of the fault lines are weakened: there is less material to keep up adequate lateral stress. Then, the soil around the softer/weaker side of the fault will deform and be compacted, or fail and result in earthquake. Deformation/compaction and fault failure do happen naturally too, but humans may have extracted too much underground resources for the natural healing process to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. It is known that the fault of the West Coast is lacking stress and the soil is deformed in the Amos et al. (2014) study. If this keeps up, the arch structure of the crust will crumble down catastrophically, and in chain reaction too. And it doesn't take ""much"" edge weakening to fail an arch.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Additional information: The Amos study says that California lost 160 KM^3 of groundwater in the past 150 years. Now, add the amount of oil extracted. Then, add the amount of oil, water, minerals that are extracted along the West Coast of North and South America, Australia, Japan, South East Asian Islands. This should give some idea of how big are the holes human dug underground.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>The scenario may correspond with the Pacific plates. There are numerous oil, and water extracting operations all around the Pacific. After decades of intensive and continuous resource extractions, it may be showing terminal signs of  the natural healing process failing to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. First, there are quite a few very strong earthquakes concentrated in the last ten years (<a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/10_largest_world.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/10_largest_world.php</a>). This alone may be trivial since the Pacific Ring of Fire is well known to churn out earthquakes. However, combined with the recent persistent droughts of Australia, Chile, US (especially California), and this year, Canada, the situation may be really concerning.</p></li>
<li><p>Droughts alone can be caused by weather patterns. Climate change can cause it too, but it is a global factor, as opposed to more localized factor such as weather patterns. However, I think that underground processes can also cause drought. Aquifers can store a lot of heat, so the lack of underground water means  that the geothermal energy will dissipate into the surrounding soil, basically slowly baking it. Less water also means that the soil is more prone to compression. Compression, especially continuous, even if it's slow, also generates heat. Oil reservoirs are also similar, but since oil is more reactive to heat by transforming into gas, and continuously extracted by humans, their pore pressure varies more. The presence of oil reservoirs around the fault lines may serve as springs. By extracting oil/gas, humans lessen the expansion force of those liquid and gas and reduce the pore pressure, which stabilizes the fault line. But in the long term, as is the case now, the reality is that there will be not enough oil to provide adequate pore pressure/lateral stress/counter-compression force. This may be the cause of the recent frequent strong earthquakes; the plates are loosening. Eventually, all the edges of the Pacific ring will all fail in an epic catastrophe, as the arch structure of the crust crumbles.  Also, by removing oil, it liberates more space for gas to form. Gas is more compressible and heated by compression; it is another source geothermal heat. It is like a bike air pump/air suspension system. The idea is that the excess of geothermal energy causes surface water to dry out faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possibility is that the fault line of the West American continent is already caving in and is dipping deeper/entering into more contact with the mantle. The mantle is a way stronger source of heat, and without adequate of underground heat absorbers, the surface soil becomes baked. I think that it's also the cause of the Blob (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob_%28Pacific_Ocean%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob_%28Pacific_Ocean%29</a>). The heat of the soil is escaping into the ocean, forming the Blob. Combined with El Nino, it worsens the drought.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, humans have dug up resources around active fault lines of the Pacific for more than a century. The weakened soil/plate edges lead to excessive geothermal energy affecting the surface.</p>

<p>So yeah, in the end, is it possible that the recent droughts are signs of epic crust failure?</p>

<p>Please kindly point out if my observation/logic makes sense and/or may correspond with reality.</p>

"Classification of rivers according to width","<p>I'm looking for a simple classification of rivers according to their width. In which size categories should I split them?

I'm interested in the width at a given spot and point in time, not in the variability in width along the river or in different seasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>below 2m (can be jumped)</li>
<li>3-10m (may be used for leisure water sport)</li>
<li>11-25m (smaller commercial vessels?)</li>
<li>26-50m (large commercial vessels?)</li>
<li>51-100m (may still be bridged)</li>
<li>over 100m (very large rivers, close to flowing into the sea)</li>

"What is the consensus among geologists about climate change being caused by humans?","<p>I'm terribly frustrated with the way that climate change has been debated in Europe. I live in the Netherlands and members  of one of the biggest parties here, the Party for Freedom (PVV), frequently deny climate change and use terms like ""climate hysteria"" and ""the religion of climate change"". While I'm no climate scientist, geologist or meteorologist I do worry about the climate, simply for the reason that the large majority of experts does! I know that the exact percentage of consensus has been debated, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-15/97-percent-consensus-on-climate-change-it-s-complicated"" rel=""noreferrer"">consensus according to Bloomberg</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/03/is-the-climate-consensus-97-999-or-is-plate-tectonics-a-hoax"" rel=""noreferrer"">consensus according to the Guardian explaining their methods</a>, but it's pretty hard to argue that there is no consensus in general.. </p>

<p>However, one of the arguments that climate change skeptics use is that the 97% (or whatever percentage you feel is right) consensus among climate scientists  is misleading. Misleading, because most climate scientists are meteorologists, and meteorologists tend to have a different view on climate, compared to geologists. The skeptics say that the consensus among geologists is way lower. From what I understand (again I'm  no geologist), is that some geologists support an alternative theory to explain climate change that involves plate tectonics.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is in fact the consensus among geologists about climate change being caused by humans? </p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Please excuse me for the elaborate introduction to my question. I don't want to make this a concealed political statement, but it is something that's bothering me. Why would you, as a layman, choose to believe the small minority on such an important issue? I definitely don't think we should ignore or silence climate change skeptics, obviously accepted scientific beliefs have been proven wrong in the past, but it does feel rather strange to me that so many politicians are of an opinion that is backed by only 3% of the world's leading scientists.   </p>

"What control the atmospheric lifetime of different metals in aerosols?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I'm analysing the metallic elements in $PM_{2.5}$ to identify their possible anthropogenic sources for the study area. </p>

<p>A total of 19 metallic elements were investigated including dust-derived elements such as $Al, Ca, Mg$ and pollution-derived elements such as $Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn$</p>

<p>To better investigate the characteristics of different elements, their temporal variation (daily samples, collecting once for 6 days at an industrial city in China) during the whole year was analyzed. </p>

<p>I found out the burning of fireworks for celebrating China Spring Festival presented significant contribution to related elements, such as:   </p>

<ul>
<li>$Al, Mg$: they are utilized for the fuels of gunpowder. </li>
<li>$K$: the chemical compounds of $K$$ (KClO_4, KClO_3, KNO_3$) are usually utilized for the oxidant of gunpowder.     </li>
<li>$Cu, Sr, Ba$ : used for generating lighting in different color.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the emission of firework burning were centered on the festival night, the influence should be short. We collect the aerosol samples and analyzed their species for the festival, one day after festival and two days after festival.  </p>

<h3>Observation results</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of related elements presented the significant levels on the festivity and decreased sharply in the next day (~ 100 times). </p></li>
<li><p>However, I found three heavy metals with adverse health effects ($Pb, Cd, As$) had increases in concentration levels after the festival. Their concentration levels recovered to their normal level after 3 days.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>My thought</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most of the related elements recovered to their normal levels in one day, the accumulation of $Pb, Cd, As$ should not be blamed on meteorological conditions; </li>
<li>There might not be other important sources leading to the continuous increases of $Pb, Cd, As$ in 3 days, </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, I though the accumulation of high concentration levels in 3 days should be attributed to firework burning,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This finding would be valuable since a short-time emissions event resulted in a relative long-time exposure to high concentrations if my inference is correct. </p>

<h3>My question</h3>

<p>Does the atmospheric lifetime differs for specific elements?  I assumed that the elements $Pb, Cd, As$ presented a long atmospheric lifetime with less deposition? 
I still felt confused by the phenomenon. Any advice or comments on my question would be hugely appreciated! </p>

<p>Here’s the link: <a href=""https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaaw4132"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaaw4132</a></p>

<p>So instead of doing that, why not drill a large hole straight down into one end of a section of the ice shelf (closest to land but still a thick part of ice) and insert a large tap and then use large fresnel lens to melt a slope in the ice and funnel the melted ice into the hole and out the spout to be diverted further inland which would eventually refreeze later?</p>

<p>You would just have to melt the section of the ice shelf at a graded slope so that gravity does all the work. If you look at how water towers work and then consider the thickness of the ice shelf, you could calculate amount of water pressure and will see that it would suffice to move large quantities of water at a very fast pace.</p>

"Isn't a warmer climate better for energy generation?","<p>Nowadays, everyone talks about it: climate change, and more importantly, how to stop it from happening. Although there's a lot of debate around the topic, the conscensus is that by inventing a way of generating clean energy, we can slow down (and maybe even reverse) the effects global warming has on the planet. Using energy that was created without burning millions of years worth of stored carbon, we can not only power our everyday lives, but also capture the carbon we've been blowing into our atmosphere using the energy-intensive process of carbon capture.</p>

<p>But there are still some problems. Currently, photovoltaic cells are pretty much useless during winter when it comes to fueling the homes of millions (at least where I live). We want to warm our homes, but there's not enough clean energy during those months, so we fall back on nuclear.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it therefore be better to have a small rise in global temperature? I mean, a higher temperature means you don't have to warm your home during winter (as much). During summer, you can use the extra energy generated by the photovoltaic cells to power airconditioners in order to cool buildings and (maybe) use some excess energy to stop the snowball effect that those higher temperatures would have on the climate and keep it at a constant level. Even though cooling requires more energy than heating, might it break even?</p>

<p>I don't have the knowledge nor the means to calculate if this is the case.</p>

<p>I know that climate change is a thing and that it's really, really bad. I'm not a guy that doesn't believe the effects it has on our surroundings. I just don't have the means to investigate this idea, that's why I ask you: will the rise in temperature have a positive effect on our energy production and the ability to satisfy energy demand?</p>

I was told to give this SE a chance. If you think it doesn't belong on this SE please let me know how to appropriately edit or otherwise another SE to try.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: This problem comes from my interest in exoplanet sciences but is applicable to earth sciences.</em></p>

<p>Something that's unclear to me is the exact relationship between gases within an atmosphere and the concentration of those gases within the bodies of water under that atmosphere (like an ocean).</p>

<p>For example, the solubility of <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> at <span class=""math-container"">$298K$</span> and 1 bar of atmospheric pressure is ≈ 1.496 g/L in water. My understanding is that number indicates how much <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> can be dissolved within water before the water is saturated with <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> and won't accept any more. However this doesn't tell me what the concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> <em>would be</em> under given conditions, it just sets a maximum cap. So 1.496 g/L of <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> <em>might</em> be dissolved in water, but it could be much much less. </p>

<p><strong>Key Question:</strong> What are the calculations I need to go through to figure out the amount (total and ratios) of gases in both a planet's oceans and atmosphere assuming I know either:</p>

<ol>
<li>The total amount of gases within the ocean/atmosphere system, or...</li>
<li>The amount of gases present in the atmosphere but not the corresponding amount present in the waters.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I want to be able to figure out <em>all</em> the ratios of gases within an atmosphere and dissolved in a planet's waters. Ball-parking is fine if that's the best I can do.</strong></p>

<p>I know this is probably a very complex topic, so if it's helpful you could look at the idealized  earth situation I've outlined (below) and rift off those numbers. Not necessary, but there if you need it.</p>

<p>You could also take the approach of looking at two gases with very different solubility in water, like <span class=""math-container"">$CH_4$</span> than <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span> and look at what would happen to the ratios if there was a heck of a lot more of the less-soluble gas (Methane in this case) in the system than the more soluble gas. </p>

<p><strong>Whatever approach you take, I'd appreciate any insight you can provide. What I really want to learn is both general principles as well as how to establish those principles in actual calculations.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Scenario: If useful refer to these numbers</strong></p>

<p>Assume uniform temperatures at water surface. Assume no minerals dissolved in water.</p>

<p>The mass of trees comes mainly from cellulose which is roughly 50% carbon.

  <p><strong>polar vortex</strong></p>
  
  <p>A planetary-scale mid- to high-latitude circumpolar cyclonic circulation, extending from the middle troposphere to the stratosphere. <strong><em>The Northern Hemisphere vortex often features two centers</em></strong>—one near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia—with analogous circumpolar asymmetry atypical in the Southern Hemisphere.

<p>an excerpt...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps it is even more amazing that in the past 65 million years
  there has been only one such bend. Even more remarkable is the
  observation that the straight portions of the chain are straight. As
  we shall see below, the configuration of the plate boundaries in the
  Pacific have changed dramatically during the lifetime of the Hawaiian
  hotspot. If, as many geophysicists believe, subduction drives
  tectonics, then how on earth can the straight parts be so straight and
  move at constant velocities for tens of millions of years? The answer
  to these questions remains a mystery!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ADDED:  Sept 1st.  an excerpt from a link to information in the comment below. thank you MyCarta, good information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain is a prominent
  feature usually attributed to a change in Pacific plate motion approx
  47 Myr ago. However, global plate motion reconstructions fail to
  predict the bend. Here we show how the geometry of the
  Hawaiian-Emperor chain and other hotspot tracks can be explained when
  we combine global plate motions with intraplate deformation and
  movement of hotspot plumes through distortion by global mantle flow.
  Global mantle flow models predict a southward motion of the Hawaiian
  hotspot. This, in combination with a plate motion reconstruction
  connecting Pacific and African plates through Antarctica, predicts the
  Hawaiian track correctly since the date of the bend, but predicts the
  chain to be too far west before it. But if a reconstruction through
  Australia and Lord Howe rise is used instead, the track is predicted
  correctly back to 65 Myr ago, including the bend. The difference
  between the two predictions indicates the effect of intraplate
  deformation not yet recognized or else not recorded on the ocean
  floor. The remaining misfit before 65 Myr ago can be attributed to
  additional intraplate deformation of similar magnitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if that is definitive or not?</p>

<p>I have come across this image showing the lately determined ""pattern of expansion"" the earth is undergoing:  perhaps then the quote above is indicating a ""perceived balance caused in the expansion as correctly predicting and matching the movement of the plume and plates relative to the pattern?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/znO31.jpg"" alt=""Pattern of overall tectonic plate expansion""></p>

<p>****UPDATE Sept 24th -- Information from MyCarta** </p>

<p>MyCarta ""I think the more recent research leans towards a combination of intraplate deformation and movement of the plume itself, combined with the plate motion, e.g.""</p>

<p>And about Euler plates, and Lord Howe's Rise</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/demos/BRICK/brick.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/demos/BRICK/brick.html</a></p>

<p>as added in a comment below, quoted from the paper's abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if a reconstruction through Australia and Lord Howe rise is used
  instead, the track is predicted correctly back to 65 Myr ago,
  including the bend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the first paragraph in the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hotspots are frequently assumed to be fixed and used as a reference
  frame for plate motions. However, when the Hawaiian hotspot track is
  predicted from a global plate motion chain based on relative plate
  motion data, and it is assumed that the Hawaiian hotspot is fixed
  relative to African hotspots, it does not fit the observed track: the
  predicted track is essentially straight, lies south of the Hawaiian
  seamount chain, and has no feature corresponding to the
  Hawaiian-Emperor bend. Explanation of this misfit requires one of the
  following, or a combination of them, to be true: (1) motion of Pacific
  plate hotspots, in particular more than 1,000 km south-westward motion
  for the Hawaiian hotspot between ,80 Myr ago and the time of the bend
  and minor southward motion after this time, (2) motion of hotspots in
  the African hemisphere, (3) motion at an additional plate boundary, or
  (4) deformation at a diffuse intraplate boundary not included in the
  plate motion chain. Palaeomagnetic data from the Emperor chain3 yield
  a southward component of Hawaiian hotspot motion more than 1,000 km
  relative to the palaeomagnetic axis between ,80 and 49 Myr ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the rest of the paper they used 2 main models (other models were discarded). The first included only hotspot motion which is sufficient to explain discrepancies between predicted and observed hotspot tracks (e.g. Hawaiian-Emperor chain) back to 47 Ma ago, but before 47 Ma ago the predicted hotspot tracks do not include the bend. Their second model added intraplate deformation (in their reference plates Antarctica/New Zealand) to hotspot motion and is able to predict the hotspot track all the way back to 65 Ma ago with good accuracy, including the bend, and with less accuracy (meaning that it is off too far to the west) until 85 My ago.""</p>

<p><strong>Sept 24th MORE QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>I'm getting the feeling tectonic plate heave and settle and patterns of interaction are the current best theory for the resulting relative motion of the Hawaii hotspot.</p>

<p>So we are increasing the scale of the question to ask what is it that drives the schedule of the tectonic plates, such that the result is the ever so slow motion of the Hawaii hotspot.  What is felt to be the root cause of <strong>timing</strong> of plate and continent shift??</p>

"How is the specific heat of a wet bulb determined?","<p>I am quite new to the psychrometry and the study of humidity, and I'm currently learning about the dry-bulb wet-bulb thermometry.

<p>I can understand the concept here, but I believe I would need the heat capacity of the bulb to know the exact temperature drop in the wet bulb compared to the dry bulb. However, different thermometers may have different heat capacity and may show different wet bulb temperatures. How is this mitigated?

<p>Perhaps a different question, I also can't envision a way that a measurement of 1 cm change is pragmatically meaningful, even for just a single beach, never mind a global average. A 1 cm higher tide I don't think would be noticed at most places. Even 10 cm could go unnoticed at many places. Does a 1 cm global average change mean anything useful?

"Are old geophysics textbooks useful?","<p>I have had much success with old textbooks in mathematics. Generally, for any branch of mathematics that I (as a non-mathematician) would like to learn or re-learn, I can buy a classic textbook from the 1970s, and it will be accurate and cheap.</p>

<p>However, as a computer scientist, I know that this is not a great strategy for all subjects. </p>

"Origin of Serious Wildfires","<p>At a very rough estimate, what proportion of wildfires are caused by natural events like lightning? I am absolutely sure that in Europe, where there are often wildfires, the sun is never hot enough to set fire to vegetation directly, though it obviously makes things tinder dry and easily combustible. The broken bottle theory has been disproved. Experiments involving broken glass among highly combustible straw or hay were unsuccessful in causing combustion, though manual focussing of the suns rays with the lens-shaped bottom of a bottle were on rare occasions and with much difficulty successful. Although lightning undoubtedly causes the occasional wildfire, the majority have no connection with lightning. It should also be remembered that lightning is usually accompanied by torrential rain. These fires often start in several places at once, which is stretching the long arm of coincidence a bit too far. </p>

<p>Apart from the very rare instances of volcanos causing wildfires, what other natural causes could there be?
Comparison of wildfire frequency in tinder-dry uninhabited areas, well away from civilisation, versus frequency in or near similar but populated areas should give a good idea of the scale of the problem.  </p>

"If today's Earth becomes warmer, how will it compare to the Earth of the Cretaceous period?","<p>Most pessimistic scenarios about climate change predicts a global rise of temperature of several Celsius degrees over the course of the 21st century if no action is taken. While such a shift in temperature has many implications such as rising seal levels (due to the melting of ice near the poles) and a mass extinction event, the Earth has recordedly had eras warmer than today in the past, such as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cretaceous period</a>. For reminders, Cretaceous is the last geological period before the extinction of dinosaurs, and it had notably higher sea levels and a warmer global surface temperature (4 °C above today's average surface temperature).</p>

<p>Assume now that the average surface temperature will rise as predicted by the aforementioned pessimistic scenarios, and that the seal levels will rise drastically.</p>

<p>How would tomorrow's Earth (in this scenario) compare to the Earth of the Cretaceous period ? Would it be in a similar state (besides temperature and sea levels), and perhaps share similar climates around the world, or would various factors I didn't mention (such as the ratio of oxygen in the air) make it very different ?</p>

"
"What is the most optimal latitude on Earth for the generation of extreme maximum temperatures?","<p>First question on this StackExchange, so here goes...</p>

<p>Overall, reaching high temperatures is dependent on 2 factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>The (maximum) solar angle in the day. The greater the solar angle, the more insolation is received by the surface and air, allowing higher maximum temperatures assuming no thermal inertia.</li>
<li>The length of the day. The longer the day, the more total solar radiation arrives in one 24-hour span, and the shorter the night is to radiate off excess energy, both of which due to the thermal inertia of the atmosphere and ground bias them towards hot temperatures.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Again due to thermal inertia, it may be dependent on the day length and solar angle of previous days, though this influence is more minor.)</p>

<p>The first factor explains why even though at the summer solstice the poles accumulate more solar energy over 24 hours than any other place on Earth (I know I had a source on this. I can't find it, though.), they are still extremely cold as the low solar angle prevents reaching higher temperatures. The second factor explains why even though the equatorial region has the highest average maximum solar angles throughout the year, they don't get especially hot (even in rare desert areas) as the day length is nearly constant throughout the year.</p>

<p>Ergo, the outer tropics and the subtropics experience the hottest extreme maximum temperatures on Earth. This can be seen in the records for each continent that has a large stretch in that area:</p>

<ul>
<li>America (South): 48.9 °C in Rivadavia, Argentina (24.18[3]° S)</li>
<li>Africa (South): 50 °C in Dunbrody, South Africa (~33.4° S)</li>
<li>Australia: 50.7 °C in Oodnadatta, South Australia (27.54811° S)</li>
<li>Africa (North): 51.3/53.5 °C in Ouargla, Algeria (31.95° N)</li>
<li>Asia: 53.9 °C in Mitribah, Kuwait (29.81[6]° N)</li>
<li>and lastly, America (North): 54.0/54.4/56.7 °C in Furnace Creek, California, USA at a rather high 36.458056° N.</li>
</ul>

<p>Presumably, the spread in latitudes is due to the geography in those areas being much more suited to the generation of extreme heat than places at the ""absolute ideal latitude"". <strong>But what is this absolute ideal latitude? At what point from the equator do the combination of day length and solar angle in summer create the most optimal conditions for extreme heat, other factors being equal?</strong></p>

"Can aerostats be used for fine-grained control of the weather","<p>Most of the discussed geoengineering ideas aim to change the average temperature of the earth instead of trying to control local weather.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aerostats</a> can be used to change the local temperature in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>if covered with reflective material they can create shadow;</li>
<li>if covered with dark material they can significantly increase the temperature above the cloud potentially dispersing the cloud;</li>
<li>if combined into a structure similar to a solar updraft tower, they can transport dust and humidity to the height where they would not be transported by natural winds and by that either condensate the water or create new clouds.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a large enough number of devices like this it should be possible to guide humid air to deserts, or to prevent hurricanes by removing convective available potential energy on their path.</p>

<p>Is there any research about the possibility of controlling the weather with devices like these, or is there some obvious flaw that would make this completely impossible? (Lack of helium is not a good argument, as these aerostats are not meant to lift any additional weight, and are meant to be as large as possible, so could use air heated by the sun).</p>

<p>If this is possible, what percentage of earth surface would we need to cover with these devices to counteract CO2 effects? From a rough assessment of incoming radiation vs radiation trapped by human released CO2 it seems to be much smaller than 1%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Solar geoengineering refers to a range of proposed methods for counteracting global warming by artificially reducing sunlight at Earth’s surface. The most widely known solar geoengineering proposal is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which has impacts analogous to those from volcanic eruptions. Observations following major volcanic eruptions indicate that aerosol enhancements confined to a single hemisphere effectively modulate North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the following years. Here we investigate the effects of both single-hemisphere and global SAI scenarios on North Atlantic TC activity using the HadGEM2-ES general circulation model and various TC identification methods. We show that a robust result from all of the methods is that SAI applied to the southern hemisphere would enhance TC frequency relative to a global SAI application, and vice versa for SAI in the northern hemisphere. <strong>Our results reemphasise concerns regarding regional geoengineering and should motivate policymakers to regulate large-scale unilateral geoengineering deployments</strong>. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper seems to warn against <em>single-hemisphere</em> solar geoengineering. Was that the plan to begin with, and nobody until now thought that cooling one hemisphere but not the other one might be problematic?</p>

<p>Or is this paper simply stating something more common-sense, for example ""if you do it wrong, it won't work right"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research indicates that nearby oil deposits from Pennsylvanian-age
  rocks may somehow be linked to these interesting geodes.  Oil is able

In this one I'd like to narrow the list down to soot, more precisely to ask about its ability to absorb ultraviolet and re-radiate infrared.</p>

<p>An argument by the other member goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nuclear winter (solar radiation blocked by soot) wouldn’t be that
  troublesome. High altitude soot is the “perfect” absorber and
  reradiator of infrared energy. Nights would be warmer –as are normal
  cloudy nights- and days a bit cooler. <strong>Some energy would be lost by
  reradiation to space but most conserved by earthward reradiation of
  ultraviolet converted to infrared by soot absorption.</strong> – TomO</p>

"Dolomite and calcite precipitation","<p>In an engineered wetland,  there is groundwater flow from an aquifer with a chemical composition that is rich in magnesium, calcium and sulfate. We are finding that the aquifer is consistently saturated with respect to dolomite and calcite. Similarily, the wetland is also saturated and slightly oversaturated with respect to those minerals, however concentrations of both mg and ca are higher in the wetland than the aquifer. We were expecting concentrations to be similar given saturation with respect to the carbonate minerals. So we are hypothesizing the following: </p>

<p>Alkalinity is much higher in the wetland than in the aquifer, probably due to more extensive CO2 production. Given there is more CO2 in this region, this would enhance the dissolution of dolomite and calcite and therefore cause the increase in both magneaium and calcium. However, we are not sure if those minerals can form in a short period? The system was constructed about one year ago. If the minerals are unlikely to be present and it is by chance that groundwater is oversaturated, then what can be causing the increase in both magnesium and calcium? I know cation exchange should remove those ions from solution and not the other way around. </p>

<p>For example (my brother lives in LA) in August this year there were 25 days in LA that were 'sunny days', lets say sunny for > 70% of the day. In London there were 4, giving values of 83% and 13% approx so we could roughly say that LA has 6X more sunny days per month than London. </p>

<p>My questions are;</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do the number of sun hours in London seem so high when anecdotally the difference is much much larger. </li>
<li>Where can I find data that is more suitable for my project or alter the data on sunshine hour to suit it.</li>

"To what extent is hydroelectric power really renewable?","<p>One of the more widespread ""renewable"" ways of generating power is by harnessing hydropower, i.e. by exploiting the movement of falling or flowing water. Some of the most commonly seen implementations are river dams and tidal power stations. </p>

<p>All hydroelectric power stations obviously remove some kinetic energy from the water, usually by requiring it to turn a turbine. What I'm curious about is whether the removal of this energy is actually sustainable, i.e. whether energy is introduced back into these bodies of water at such a rate that we don't need to worry about depleting our bodies of water of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Some might say that removing kinetic energy from the oceans on that scale is an obvious impossibility, but this strikes me as a foolish assumption in light of the <em>dilution hypothesis</em>, which clearly turned out false. Two-hundred years ago, people assumed that the oceans were so incredibly vast that man could never have an environmental impact on them. Today, here we stand, with oceanic acidification, warming, and overfishing being prime environmental concerns. </p>

<p>The exact same question and argument can be repeated for wind energy. </p>

<p>Do we have any idea exactly what the patterns and rates of energy transfer into our planet's water (and wind) systems are? </p>

<p><strong>What are the potential environmental impacts of the large-scale removal of kinetic energy from our bodies of water?</strong> </p>

<p>(Note: among these environmental impacts, please don't focus on well-known impacts like damage to local ecosystems, loss of land, noise pollution, etc. I am chiefly interested in how this way of generating power affects our natural systems of energy storage and circulation, like oceanic and wind currents.)</p>

<p>The following question is off-topic, but it's a good follow-up: how is energy even introduced into our oceanic and wind current-systems? For example, I assume the moon's push-pull is responsible for the tidal movement of the oceans. What impact does the sun play? How fast is this entire system of energy transfer?</p>

<p>Comment: I strongly endorse the use of wind and hydropower as sources of energy over the further use of fossil fuels. However, I still think it is important to do research into the actual renewability of presumed-renewable energy sources, as we don't want to end up with another fossil fuel-type situation, in which we become aware of dependency on these energy sources and their malignant environmental side-effects long after widespread enthusiastic adoption. </p>

"Why are titanium oxides lumped in with magnetite for the purposes of analyzing water bubble nucleation?","<p>I was reading a bit about the fluid mechanics of volcanoes to further understand some of the dynamics of ""magma wagging"" from my earlier question.</p>

<p>From [2]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heterogeneous nucleation, in which the presence of certain crystals (e.g., Fe-Ti oxides) provides nucleation substrates because they lower surface tension, can greatly
  reduce $\Delta p_{s_{crit}}$ to less than a few megaPascals (Gardner &amp; Denis 2004, Hurwitz &amp; Navon 1994). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I became curious as to what was so special about the Fe-Ti oxides that makes them good nucleation sites, so I looked up [1].  I stumbled upon a different problem, though.  In their procedure, they claimed: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fe-Ti oxides are either blocky or needle-shaped. Blocky ones
  are 0.5–5$\mu$m in size and those large enough were identified
  with an electron microprobe as titano-magnetite, here after
  referred to as magnetite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do mixed Fe-Ti oxides essentially have the same physical properties as magnetite?  If the physical properties are in fact even slightly different, why would they be lumped together for analysis in these nucleation studies?</p>

"Why is aerodynamic resistance defined inversely?","<p>When I think of wind resistance, I always think of the friction co-efficient, in $\mathrm{ms^{-1}}$, because that's always the way that it was presented in highschool and undergraduate physics.</p>

<p>But in land surface modelling, aerodynamic resistance (basically, how much the roughness of the surface slows air movement down), is defined inversely. For example, <a href=""http://www.iac.ethz.ch/edu/courses/master/modules/land-climate_interactions/HS2013/LCI13_lecture3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this presentation</a> states on page 18 that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>$r_a$ = $f($wind speed, atmospheric stability, surface roughness$)$</li>
  <li>$r_a$ decreases with increasing wind speed</li>
  <li>$r_a$ increases with increasing stability</li>
  <li>$r_a$ decreases with increasing surface roughness</li>
  </ul>

Grass          70

Forest         5-10

<p>From the caption of that figure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During explosive eruptions, bubble walls rupture catastrophically at the
  fragmentation surface. The released gas expands rapidly and magma ascent changes from a viscous melt with suspended bubbles to a gas flow with suspended magma fragments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My assumption is that this boundary between the magma column and the steam above it is critical to the crystallization of the minerals to form the volcanic rock. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does the composition of the volcanic rock change drastically according to the distance between the magma column and the mouth of the volcano at the time the rock is formed? </li>
<li>(Or) do the rocks melt and recrystallize frequently as the boundary moves, only attaining their final composition before they are ejected into the air?  </li>
<li>How important is the steam/air interface at the top of the volcano to the rock's formation?  </li>
</ul>

<p>I realize this is going to change based on the composition of the magma itself, but I'm looking for the behavior of an ""average"" rock species, though specific examples are great, too. </p>

"What makes the conditions at the core/mantle boundary ideal for aluminum to combine with other elements besides oxygen?","<p>Recently, steinhardite was <a href=""http://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/steinhardtite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">accepted</a> as a new mineral by the International Mineralogical Association.  It's quite an interesting story in its own right. There's an interesting article in <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329860.300-quasicrystal-quest-the-unreal-rock-that-nature-made.html"" rel=""nofollow"">New Scientist</a> about it, but it's paywalled.</p>

<p>The formula for steinhardite is $\ce{Al63Cu24Fe13}$.  It's an ultra-rare quasicrystal, at least partially because of the mixture of aluminum without oxygen, as I understand it.</p>

<p>One of the critics (as quoted in the article)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... who promptly declared the possibility
  of the sample being natural as ‘‘impossible’’. His
  concern was not the degree of perfection but,
  rather, the baffling presence of metallic Al in
  cupalite, khatyrkite and in the icosahedral
  quasicrystal phase. Metallic Al has a remarkably
  strong affinity for O, such that it could not
  possibly form naturally on the surface of the
  Earth, he argued ... he amended the conclusion to allow for the
  improbable possibility that it could have formed
  under the intense heat and pressure that exist near
  the core mantle boundary or in a high impact
  collision of meteors in space. [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core/mantle boundary is obviously rife with lots of chemical interactions, but what is it exactly about the conditions that prevents aluminum from oxidizing?  Is it just physical pressure or the presence of other gases?  </p>

<p>There's the obvious fact that the aluminum isn't exposed to the atmosphere, but my (limited) understanding is that oxygen is plentiful in combination with other elements like silicon.   </p>

"How accurate is the law of superposition?","<p>Recently I started being more interested in the rational details of the sciences (... being often challenged about them by a creationist friend) and one of the creationist 'theories' I've encountered is how the law of superposition - i.e. the claim that layers of rocks form with the top layer being younger than the bottom - can be falsified. They mentioned some creationist experiments where layers formed 'sideways' and used it as one of the arguments to 'prove' that Earth does not have to be millions of years old.</p>

<p>Now I do not want to engage in a theological discussion, but I was wondering how accurate law of superposition is. Most articles I've read refer to it as an axiom of geology - i.e. something that is assumed, rather than proved. At the same time I am aware of the fact that it's a ""first level big picture axiom"", in that everyone is aware of the fact that under special circumstances the details get a bit foggy, but looking at the whole world it is correct ""often enough"" to warrant making it an axiom to simplify the theory for beginning geologists.</p>

<p>Thus my question is: In the global scope, how significant are the deviations from law of superposition in the structure of Earth's strata? Would you say less than 1% of the world show any significant deviation from the law?</p>

"What are the environmental effects of leaking hydrogen from large-scale energy storage mechanisms?","<p>I recently have calculated the total cost of an energy system that is based on wind power as the primary power source and hydrogen as the energy storage mechanism. The total system costs are approximately similar to a system based only on new nuclear power plants built according to current regulations in the current market conditions. All of this is somewhat roughly estimated, as we don't know how much electrolyzers, hydrogen storage solutions, and hydrogen to electricity conversion in turbines or fuel cells costs in very large scales.</p>

<p>However, hydrogen needs to be stored somewhere. Its energy density by weight is extremely high, but energy density by volume is very low, even when compressed or liquefied. There are several solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Liquid hydrogen. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of liquid hydrogen is low. Also, even with thermally isolated containers, the hydrogen needs to gradually leak away.</li>
<li>Compressed hydrogen stored in pipelines. Unfortunately, hydrogen causes embrittlement of steel, possibly leading to hydrogen leaks.</li>
<li>Storage in old mines, old depleted oil/gas fields, etc. However, hydrogen could theoretically leak.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these solutions have the possibility that hydrogen will leak away.</p>

<p>Therefore, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the environmental effects of hydrogen leaked to the atmosphere?</li>
<li>What is the atmospheric lifetime of hydrogen?</li>
<li>What is the global warming potential of hydrogen on timescales that matter (let's say 20 years or 100 years)?</li>
<li>What is the mechanism of removal from the atmosphere? Oxidation to water, or similar to helium: escaping to space?</li>
<li>Is the usage of hydrogen as an energy storage mechanism even justified based on the environmental effects, or are the effects so bad that it makes sense to continue burning of fossil fuels or reconsider nuclear energy?</li>
</ul>

"Judging wind speed based on flags and inland-water observations","<p>About a year ago, I took this video along the Hudson river in NY, and I'm trying to figure out the Beaufort number based on the water and the flags.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqjvTALRWW8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqjvTALRWW8</a></p>

<p>The problem is that the Beaufort scale is based primarily on open sea waters (not protected/inland waters like the Hudson river).  The only mention in the scale relating to inland waters is force 5 (""crested wavelets (whitecaps) form on inland waters"") - but nothing related to the higher force numbers.</p>

<p>In this video, there are definitely lots of whitecaps, which leads me to believe that the wind was force 5 or higher.  Possibly even a 6.</p>

<p>Flags are another indicator; but here it is kind of vague.  At force 5, flags start rippling and flapping hard, and as the wind gets stronger, they start beating/snapping, until finally they are fully extended with only the very end flapping (force 7).  So looking at the flag in the video makes me think it's a 6.</p>

<p>What steady force/speed is the wind really blowing here?  What about gusts?</p>

"How was Venice flooded?","<p>If I understand this correctly, Venice was <em>not</em> flooded due to sudden rainfall causing rivers to overflow, but due to the <strong>high tides</strong>. These high tides were caused by an alignment of sun, which was expanding the waters of the oceans disproportionately on one hemisphere and moon, which shifted the center of gravity of the moon-earth system in such a way that water rose on the same hemisphere.</p>

<p>In the news articles that I see, they also mention <strong>strong winds</strong>. This would make sense. High baseline + waves = a lot of water in the city. But in these photos everything seems to be calm. No waves, no wind, just an abnormally high level of water:</p>

<p>For me this doesn't make any sense. If the winds subsided and the flooding was caused <strong>purely by tidal effects, which are astronomical events</strong>, shouldn't it have been predictable months, if not years in advance?</p>

"Global Gridded Daily Temperature (at 2m): difference between GEFS Reforcast and NCEP Reanalysis","<p>I am looking for gridded/raster estimates of daily mean temperature (ideally ambient/at 2 meter) for a public health analysis. Specifically, I want to correlate daily mortality counts with daily mean ambient temperature (globally, between the years 1990-2016). I want to use gridded data rather than nearby temperature stations to allow for some extrapolation to areas without stations with long time series (e.g. large swaths of sub-Saharan Africa).</p>

<p>The accuracy of temperature in terms of degrees is somewhat less important relative to the accuracy of day-to-day variability for this project.</p>

<p>It seems like the <a href=""https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/download.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GEFS Reforcast</a> and <a href=""https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.gaussian.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NCEP Reanalysis</a> products both provide daily mean temperature at a global extent, albeit at different spatial resolutions.

<p>Is one product substantially better than the other for global mean ambient temperature estimates? Is there a simple difference between the two products that I've missed?</p>

<p>Parameters I care about (roughly in order):</p>

<ol>
<li>Daily measurement of mean temperature with global coverage</li>
<li>High spatial resolution</li>
<li>Accuracy of day to day variation (e.g. if day 1 was X degrees hotter than day 2, is that reflected?)</li>
<li>Accuracy of daily mean estimate</li>

"Computing Isentropic Potential Vorticity from Hybrid Sigma Pressure levels","<p>My task is to compute isentropic potential vorticity on a grid.
All data (ECMWF ens) are given on a hybrid sigma pressure grid.
Since I really cannot find reference, I assume (!) that relative vorticity (vo, id=138) is evaluated on model levels and therefore is useless for me.</p>

<p>My approach (for each grid point):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compute theta-gradient, using the three model dimensions, converting vertical and horizontal distances to meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Define two vectors using three constraints each:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scalar product with theta gradient vanishes.</li>
<li>First vector has no meridional, second one no zonal component.</li>
<li>Distance to adjacent horizontal grid point defines magnitude of 
meridional/zonal component.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These two vectors now span a plane tangential to the isentropic surface at the current grid point. They point to positions only vertically displaced from the horizontal neighbours of the current grid point.</li>
<li>Values of u and v are interpolated - again, using meters (geopotential height) - to the locations given by the tangent vectors.</li>
<li>The geometrical length of these tangent vectors is determined and used together with the interpolated values of u and v to compute isentropic relative vorticity.</li>
<li>Static stability is computed using values of pressure and theta at current point and vertical neighbour.</li>
<li>Using gravitational acceleration and the conversion factor of 10^-6, I use the equation given in the famous book by Wallace &amp; Hobbs for Potential Vorticity: $g(f + \eta_{\theta})\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial p}$</li>
</ol>

<p>My problem:</p>

<p>The result does not look like what I expect.
Values range from around -30 to +50 pvu throughout the atmosphere, while the 1.5pvu surface clearly does not depict the tropopause. It looks more like an accident. I am using ""omp"" to increase computation speed, but things look the same if I don't use it, too, so it cannot be index confusion.</p>

<h3>My question:</h3>

<p>What could be wrong?
Can you spot systematic errors? Maybe I got blind with time.
Do you know reference for how relative vorticity is evaluated in the ECMWF model? (I tried, really...)</p>

<p>To be more specific:
My method is to be implemented in C++ into an already existing environment to visualize NWP data in 3D in realtime.
The basic datafields - given in hybrid sigma coordinates - are read, processed, written into a derived data field, interpolated to and rendered on pressure levels as triggered by user interaction.
The program should possess the processing methods on its own, which is why I cannot use Python packages, for example.</p>

<p>Here is the source code of my approach.  If something is unclear, please ask!
Maybe somebody will spot an error.</p>

"Are Helium 3 and 4 being produced by earth's core?","<p>J. Marvin Herndon claims that the evidence of the georeactor comes from <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios released to the oceans at the mid oceanic ridges. Georeactor-produced <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios are related to the extent of actinide fuel consumption at time of production and are high near the end of the georeactor lifetime. Georeactor numerical simulation results and the observed high <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios measured in Icelandic and Hawaiian oceanic basalts indicate that the demise of the georeactor is approaching.

If that's the case, isn't the mantle turning into the crust by the mantle hardening into mountains and volcanoes?

If that was the case, the areas of Earth that aren't constantly spitting magma onto the surface would eventually be thinned out to the point that a hole or giant crack would appear leading straight to the mantle and that would be bad.</p>

"Does seismic anisotropy follow stratigraphy?","<p>This question is in the context of velocity model building for reflection seismic imaging (between 0km and 10km in a sedimentary basin).</p>

<p>This is really a rock physics question disguised as an imaging question.</p>

<p><strong>A brief description of what I am trying to do:</strong></p>

<p>In order to perform seismic imaging (aka seismic migration), we assume that the velocity structure of the earth is known. This allows us to place the recorded reflection amplitudes in the correct location in 3D space to give us a real representation of the underlying geology (including depth, dips, and scaled reflection coefficients).</p>

<p>We can obtain this laterally varying velocity model from iterative traveltime tomography of the same data. We typically account for the polar velocity anisotropy (i.e. difference in velocity of the same rock when measured parallel vs perpendicular to bedding planes) in the form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_isotropy#Thomsen_parameters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thomsen parameters</a>, in a symmetry model usually called TTI (tilted transverse isotropy). The final model consists of 5 spatially varying parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theta (angle of structural dip, the axis of symmetry is assumed perpendicular to bedding)</li>
<li>Phi (angle of structural strike, the axis of symmetry is assumed perpendicular to bedding) </li>
<li>V0 (velocity along this axis of symmetry)</li>
<li>Epsilon (Thomsen parameter describing the magnitude of large angle anisotropy)</li>
<li>Delta (Thomsen parameter describing the magnitude of small angle anisotropy)</li>
</ul>

<p>Theta and Phi are easy to obtain directly from the seismic image (this is in part why this process is iterative).</p>

<p>An initial model for V0, epsilon, and delta is created from sparse well data and further detail is obtained between control points by using tomography. In practice, epsilon and delta are assumed to be linearly related and that the linear relation holds throughout the dataset (this is usually a good assumption).</p>

<p>This leaves us solving for really just two things in tomography: V0 and delta. However, there is an intrinsic non-uniqueness, made worse by noise, in which different combinations of V0 and delta explain the data equally well (i.e. <a href=""http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gather"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image gather flatness</a>).</p>

<p><strong>So the motivation for my question is this:</strong> How can I use <em>a priori</em> geologic data to guide the solution of this ill-posed inverse problem?</p>

<p>I am very skeptical about having the geologic structure guide V0 since my dataset is in an active foreland basin with strong active deltaic deposition. This means that my sediments (structurally deformed progradational sand-shale sequences) are very unconsolidated and compaction (therefore, depth) is the main driver of velocity rather than stratigraphy. In other words, I expect velocity contours to cross structural ones in areas of high dip (and I have evidence of these normal compaction trends from well data).</p>

<p><strong>Which now leads to my question:</strong> Can I use the geologic structure to guide my Thomsen delta (i.e. the degree of anisotropy)? Does it make sense to assume that even though compaction is the main driver for velocity in unconsolidated sediments, stratigraphy is the main driver of anisotropy?</p>

<p>Maybe a more useful question: What other measurements or observations would I need to make to validate or reject this assumption?</p>

<p>If this assumption makes sense, I can add the additional constraint (as a regularization term) to the tomographic inverse problem such that the solution for delta must (at least somewhat) follow the structural dip (i.e. theta and phi).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Environmenal flow in the context of global gridded hydrological analyses","<p>Environmental flow (EF) is a widely used concept in river basin management and river ecology. There are more than 200 methods to estimate the flow that should be left to the rivers to ensure a sustainable resource management, and it is almost impossible to standardize a methodology that could be applied for each stream everywhere in the world. </p>

<p>Although some global exercises have been performed (<a href=""http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/resources/models-and-software/environmental-flow-calculators/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IWMI for instance</a>), in fact, the EF is extremely site and season specific: it depends on the natural conditions of the river, its hydrological, geo-morphological, and biological features, and its natural ecosystem. That for, the use of specific methodologies makes sense in the management of a specific river basin or a portion of it, but what about global hydrological analyses? </p>

<p>I am setting up a global gridded hydrological analysis and, while accounting for water uses, I would like to set up a threshold under which the water withdrawal is not allowed. I am thinking of using a percentile of the historical modeled monthly time series of discharge spanning a period of about 30 years. This would allow to set the threshold to a value for each month that is a percentile of the historical undisturbed (natural, with no fragmentation or withdrawal) discharge, for each of the grid-cells.

"How to obtain the correlation between monthly streamflows based on physical concepts?","<p>I've been tasked with generating synthetic streamflow scenarios through disaggregation.</p>

<p>First, I will generate 50 years of streamflow data. For that, I will probably use a simple model as AR(1) or an ARMA(1,1) and am adopting some probabilistic parameters based on streamflow data I have. These data come from the historical record a gauge station.</p>

<p>From my yearly flow, I have to generate monthly streamflows. In the end, instead of 50 streamflow realizations, each one representing an annual flow; I'll have 600 streamflow realizations, each representing a monthly stream flow.</p>

<p>Now, to get from annual to monthly stream flow, I will need a correlation matrix.</p>

<p>I could simply estimate the monthly correlation from January to December by calculating the correlation among monthly streamflows from a set of historical streamflow.</p>

<p>One could say that the physical aspects involving the (auto)correlation are implicit in the data itself. However, the data I have for this gauge station - as for any other - is only one realization of the stochastic process from which the observed streamflows were generated.</p>

<p><strong>How, then, could I enrich this monthly (auto)correlation with physical concepts stemming from the river where the gauge station is located?

"What efforts have been made to separate the microseismic events related to wind-related ocean waves from the components of volcanic origin?","<p>I have read the question <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/218/what-generates-the-microseism"">What generates the microseism?</a> and it's accompanying answer.</p>

<p>In [#1, cited below], they use the azimuth values of seismographic activity on the flanks of the volcano Stromboli to discern where this microseismic ""noise"" is coming from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The behaviour of polarisation at the east flank lets us suppose
  that the microseismic noise comes from this direction.
  This is the direction of the Scirocco wind (south, southeast
  direction) that blows on Stromboli during summer season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, according the other answer on the site, these low frequency oscillations are due to the wind's effect on the waves of the ocean.  In the initial question that sparked the answer, it was cited the frequency of these ocean waves was 0.2 Hz, which is in the 0.1-0.5 Hz region that the Stromboli researchers were looking at.</p>

<p>The whole crux of the Stromboli paper was that the microseismic events (volcanic and non-volcanic) were enough to confound the separation of the tremor signals into independent components  These researchers were using independent component analysis (ICA) and were able to pull a 0.2 Hz and a 0.4 Hz component out of the mixture (likely corresponding to the 0.2 Hz ocean wave energy mentioned in the other question). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NMaAz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>The remaining energy in the microseismic range (which can be seen in the first two components) is preventing further separation of the other components of the microseismic activity .</p>

<p>Stromboli has a constant tremor due to its ongoing activity, but have there been efforts elsewhere to suss out which of the microseismic activities are from sources in the ocean versus those coming from intermittent volcanic tremors?  Could this be achieved by using a combination of sensors, some in the ocean and some on land, or is this type of analysis not really useful?</p>

"What is the mechanism behind changes in oxidation state (of iron, for example) as magma rises?","<p>From <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/2476"">this answer</a>, I learned that rising magma may change oxidation state, which I wasn't aware of. </p>

<p>In [#1], the authors state in the abstract</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The conventional view holds that the oxidation state of a mantle-derived degassed magma reflects its source</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From other research that has been conducted, the authors discussed that the <a href=""http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/326879.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oxygen fugacity</a> (the partial pressure of the ""non-ideal"" oxygen in the presence of the high pressures and temperatures, presumably of the magma itself) was controlled by a pair of redox reactions (their equations 11 and 12):</p>

<p>$$\ce{S_{(melt)}^2- + Fe2^3+O3_{(melt)} &lt;=&gt; SO2_{(gas)} + 6Fe^2+O_{(melt)} + O_{(melt)}^2-}$$
$$\ce{SO4_{(melt)}^2- + 2Fe^2+O_{(melt)} &lt;=&gt; SO2_{(gas)} + Fe2^3+O3_{(melt)} + O_{(melt)}^2-}$$</p>

<p>Their claim is that the change in the $\ce{Fe^3+}$ to $\ce{Fe^2+}$ ratio is due to the top reaction being favored during decompression (due to the equilibrium shift from the changes in pressure).</p>

<p>I get all of that so far, I think.  My question is a more fundamental one, being, if this equilibrium (#11) governing the changes in oxidation states becomes more prevalent as the pressure decreases rapidly, what are the governing equations for when the magma is deeper in the earth?  Do they favor the bottom equation (#12) instead, or are the reactions at that temperature and pressure completely different?</p>

<p>It's possible I'm missing what the ""changing oxidation states"" aspect really means. A clarification of that would certainly be appreciated.</p>

Is it safe to assume that divergent boundaries only occur between land-land and ocean-ocean plate boundaries?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Here is a rendering from the project. Red and green lines depict convergent boundaries. Land-land convergent boundaries produce mountains. Land-sea or sea-sea boundaries produces subduction zones. Blue lines denote a divergent boundary.</p>

"Question about the physics of hurricanes","<p>I've a basic misunderstanding about the formation of tropic cyclones. From the absolute point of view, cyclones form in order to conserve total angular momentum - air masses at different latitudes have different specific angular momentum due to earth rotation (their distance from the earth's axis of rotation is different), so when a low pressure system forms, radial air flow towards the center has to rotate (in the rotating-earth frame of reference) cyclonicaly in order to conserve angular momentum. Putting it in a different point of view, the Coriolis force deflects the radial  winds to create the ""tropic cyclone"" system.</p>

<p>What i don't understand is this: one can say that the circulation system has angular momentum in the direction of the local vertical at the eye of the storm (it's local zenith direction). But such angular momentum vector has component in a direction perpendicular to the earth rotation axis! so it cannot conserve angular momentum. So what am i missing here? is it something in my basic understanding of the Coriolic force? or maybe my knowledge of the physical structure of the storm is lacking something.</p>

<p>I'd also like to know if there are models that predict maximal tropic storm size as function of latitude. I read the thermodynamic model in wikipedia excellent article on tropic storm, but this model gives upper bound about wind speed and specific rate of energy production (rate of energy production per unit area of sea surface), and doesn't give information about the size of the storm. I think that for estimating sizes one needs to use mechanical conceptions.</p>

"How can radiometric dating of meteorites determine the age of the earth?

Wouldn't radioactive decay have already been occurring in all of those  meteorites long before they hit earth? Wouldn't dating only show when the unstable nuclides in that meteorite were created, not when the earth was created? If you went and measured a decaying nuclide in a metiorite which had traveled for 500 million years before striking earth, then the dating of that metiorite would not tell us the age of the earth it would instead give us an age measurement at least 500 million years older then the earth actually is because that nuclide was decaying long before it managed to hit earth's surface.</p>

<p>Also assuming this does somehow get accounted for, how would determining the age of all these various meteorites allow us to estimate the earth's age?

<p>This is not a duplicate of the question asking about why measure meteorites not rocks, I am talking about meteorites and my question is regarding how dating can take into account when the rocks became part of earth as opposed to when the nuclides being dated first came into existence. Its not like the unstable nuclides within a metiorite suddenly decided to start decaying when they hit earth. They started decaying the minute they came into existence, including the time before they hit earth.</p>

"How do thunderstorms generate ionospheric potential?","<p>In all the explanations of how global electric circuit on Earth works, I've always encountered statements like ""thunderstorms generate ionospheric potential"" (which is about 250 kV). 
E.g. here: <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JA014758"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JA014758</a> </p>

<p>But how is that possible? Thunderstorm (or, more specifically, a lightning strike) is inherently a <em>discharge</em> rather than a <em>generator</em>. It's the breakdown of an abstract capacitor rather than the charging of it. For all intents and purposes, thunderstorms should reduce any potential difference that exists around them rather than sustain it. </p>

<p>Can somebody explain, what <em>actually</em> drives the upward current that is observed above thunderstorms? Surely it cannot be lightning itself, so what then? </p>

<p>(I'm perfectly aware that there is also a downward current in fair weather; but the same question remains - where is the generator that causes it?)</p>

"How reanalysis data influence our research/results?","<p>I am a student and I have a very simple and yet important question about reanalysis data. Recently, I attended a workshop where various other students discussing the use of ERA5 reanalysis data on their research and at some point, there was the question : ""<strong>what does the use of reanalysis data means for your research and how this type of data can impact your results?</strong>"" Nobody had a satisfying answer and now, I am trying to find papers discussing this issue. </p>

"If planting trees is ineffective to tackle climate change, why do people plant them?","<p>I've read answers that outline how if we afforested large (continental-scale) masses of land, it would do little in the way of tackling climate change. While it would sequester CO2 for about a century after it was planted (while growing) before reaching equilibrium, the planting of large quantities of trees would also sufficiently decrease the albedo of the land in which it was planted, that it would hold in a lot more heat than the land it replaced (likely desert or otherwise barren land). This means that, all things considered, it would make a negligible, if not negative impact, in tackling global warming. </p>

<p>If this is the case, why do we associate ""planting trees"" as a good thing, on the scale of individuals planting individual trees? Is it because generally, these trees improve ecosystem vitality/diversity, or for some similar reason unrelated to climate? </p>
"
"Why rely on climate models as opposed to paleoclimate data?","<p>Something I hear often from climate scientists, and indeed even politicians, is that we ""don't understand climate change very well"". And, I'm sure this is true since the climate is a complex adaptive system with thousands of dependent variables, one that we don't yet have the computational sophistication to accurately model. But that doesn't mean we don't know, to a high degree of accuracy, what is going to happen if we make certain changes to the atmospheric composition or take certain actions. We have paleoclimate data ranging extensively far back many hundreds of thousands of years, encompassing global temperature, climate cycling, atmospheric composition, and more. </p>

<p>Sure, the global temperature 100,000 years ago wasn't measured using a thermometer, but we've used various independent proxy methods that all agree with each other to a reasonable degree, right? And so do we not then have a reasonably accurate idea of Earth's climate sensitivity by simply looking at precedent? And paleoclimate will be close to <em>exactly</em> right since it takes all the variables into account <em>exactly</em> in the amount they're needed to be accounted for. Why are we still ""uncertain"" about the realities of climate change? Why are we not moving on and taking decisive action based on this--what seems to me--reliable, accurate data?</p>

"Are there any differences between the subalkali and alkali rock occuring tectonic environments?","<p>Here question ends. Beyond details exist</p>

<p>Do they occur on the same tectonic regime?
For a start to distinguish Subalkali rocks froms Alkali rocks, 
my knowledge says that mantle is the source of Alkali rocks. Ocean Island Basalts are Hawaii, Reunion etc are all Alkali rocks. Large ignous provinces are also sourced from mantle by the mantle plumes. Such as Deccan, Siberian traps.</p>

<p>But in Robil Gill's ((Gill, R. (2010). Igneous rocks and processes: a practical guide. John Wiley &amp; Sons.)) book on page 291, (chapter 9-Alkali rocks) says that Most of the large igneous provinces are subalkaline and they are much bigger and more frequent than the Alkaline Large igneous province. From this i derive that LIP's can be subalkaline. </p>

<p>So are there any difference between subalkali and alkali rock occuring tectonic environments ?</p>

"What is the most cost-effective solution to climate change based on scientific evidence?","<p>Please don't answer without citing scientific research which has a general consensus or article from a reputable source based on verifiable research citations.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-one-safe-geoengineering-option-that-could-help-reduce-the-carbon-in-our-atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article about a 2017 PNAS study from Griscom et al (link below) that ""estimated natural carbon solutions (NCS) (essentially ecosystem regeneration) have the potential to provide up to 37 percent of the CO2 mitigation that we'd need through 2030, for a 66 percent chance of holding warming to below 2°C.""</p>

<p>More specifically, what is the most cost-effective solution? Most geoengineering solutions have significant risks or unknowns which greatly reduce their benefit. Reducing fossil fuel use immediately will reduce short-term economic output with replacing with renewables and alternatives. Maybe simply paying drivers incentives to use alternative vehicles is most-cost effective, as transportation is the largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in the US (<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EPA</a>). </p>

<p>So what is the most cost-effective and how much money would it take to get it done? Global energy-related CO2 emissions were 33.1 Gt CO2 in 2018 according the [IEA report][6]. Apparently from the Griscom study, 10 USD MgCO2e−1 is the ""current cost of emission reduction efforts underway and current prices on existing carbon markets"" from 2017. 1Gt = 1Pg = 1000Mt = 1000Tg = 10^9 tonnes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne#Derived_units"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metric</a>, and 1Mg = 1 tonne, so our CO2 emissions cost us 10*10^9 or 10 billion USD per year. For reference, global GDP is at US$84.84 trillion for 2018, meaning reducing our entire emissions to zero would cost all of 0.0001% of global GDP.</p>

<p>As as corollary, if all benefits of NCS to uncalculated ecosystem services were included, would they be the most cost-effective, and what is the average ROI on research investment to calculate them?</p>

<p><strong>To the Mods</strong>: I've changed the title to match the narrow question specified in the body of the question. I've provided an answer that is very specific using calculated figures from cited references. What else would you like to make the question more narrow?</p>

"Earth and moon have different mantle compositions. Is this a fatal flaw in the 'Giant Impact hypothesis'?","<p>Deep impact ejecta on the moon seem to indicate that the moon's mantle is predominantly 'low-calcium pyroxene' (recent letter to Nature), whereas the Earth's mantle (or at least the upper mantle) is dominantly olivine with only ~15% pyroxenes. So how can this discrepancy arise if the Earth and moon have a common origin? The only possibility I can think of is if partial fractionation of magnesium silicates actually took place <em>in space</em>, before falling to either Earth or moon, with the slightly denser olivine falling to the higher gravity of Earth, and less dense pyroxene falling to the lower gravity proto-moon. Is this possible? Is there any isotopic evidence of Earth-moon mantle commonality?</p>

<p>1) Would the top of the troposphere have been much higher?</p>

"Why Do Supercontinents Form?","<p>It would seem, on the face of it, improbable that the continental land-masses would accumulate into a single composite, yet it has happened numerous times, and is expected to again in the future.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  This is <em>not</em>, as I see it, a duplicate of the 'What are the causes of the supercontinent cycle?' question.  This question goes to what process drives the <strong>formation</strong> of any &amp; all supercontinent formations, which I assert should be improbable, made more improbable by their recurrence, not so much the cycle itself.  The other question did not address this more fundamental aspect, or in any case receive a pertinent account of its resolution.

"What is the relationship between net primary productivity and emergy?","<p>Looking at the Earth system as a whole and considering ecological economics, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_production"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">net primary productivity</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">emergy</a> are two concepts that strike me as fundamental and likely related. I'm not sure what the relationship is though.</p>

<p>I'd define emergy as embodied energy, or how much total gross joules are embodied in a given process or material (or organism).</p>

<p>I'd define net primary production as the total mass of organic compounds synthesized from ""inorganic carbon"" (primarily atmospheric carbon dioxide). While this metric is a mass, it also sheds light on how relatively efficiently solar energy is used to generate life (or at least the ingredients of life, ""organic"" carbon compounds). </p>

<p>At first these two metrics seem quite different: one is a measure of energy, one is a mass. However, both metrics clarify the relationship between our relatively open-system energy resource and our closed-system nutrient cycles. For example, I in comparing different agroecosystems growing an apple, emergy can help show the energetic efficiency of each system and net primary production can help show the life-generating efficiency of each system. My word choices there seem a little ambiguous, for example, what's the difference between ""energetic efficiency"" and ""life-generating efficiency""? That's what spurs the main question, which is: <strong>what, if any, is the relationship between net primary productivity and emergy?</strong> </p>

<p>Clarification about the qualitative relationship between the two metrics would be helpful, I understand it may be overly complex to quantify it though the two terms are very much quantitative. Researching this I've found plenty of resources about each metric but none yet comparing the two, so any resources simply comparing the two would be an answer/step in the right direction.</p>

<p>So ""little help over here""?</p>

<p>ADDED Oct 12, an excerpt from an article provided by Omen.  Please ignore the part about evolutionary pressure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The amount of radioactive material in the Core was certainly greater
  in the distant past. That greater amount proportionally created
  greater heat amounts which had to get to the Earth's surface to be
  able to be radiated away. One result of this was certainly that the
  materials of the Core and Mantle were hotter than today, and therefore
  more fluid. That situation was enhanced by the remaining presence of a
  substantial amount of heat remaining from the original formation of
  the Earth. Finally, convection cell flow rates are driven by the
  amount of heat that is present, so that also would make the Core
  convective cells and the Mantle convective cells much more active and
  much more dynamically unstable than today.</p>
  
  <p>The result of all this was more heat driving convective cells in
  materials which were more fluid. This necessarily caused more rapid
  movements of those materials. This would have created substantially
  greater geomagnetic field strengths in the distant past. It would also
  have caused far more rapid lateral flow velocities in the Mantle
  convection cell tops.</p>
  
  <p>Depending on the 'grip' (or static / dynamic coefficient of friction)
  between Mantle and Crust, this could enable very rapid tectonic plate
  movements in the distant past. When that caused substantial
  north-south movement in the continental plates, strong evolutionary
  pressure would suddenly exist.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay, I waited a little to compose my words correctly, and to see if any alternate theories were strongly supported, to explain the 200+ million year rate of movement of the Emperor chain.  </p>

<p>To the best of my ability to understand the answers so far, the ""RATE"" of 
churn"" within the mantle, and resulting heaving and swirling of plate movement are derivatives of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount of heat within the earth,<br>
<ul>
<li>primordial,  </li>
<li>gravity pressure,</li>
<li>radioactive decay,  </li>
<li>tidal friction),</li>
</ul></li>
<li>combined with
<ul>
<li>the gravitational tugs of the Sun and Moon on Earth,</li>
<li>the resulting ""jitter"" within the earth caused by the Milankovitch cycles</li>
<li>and the physical dynamics, properties and characteristics of
<ul>
<li>heat generation rates,</li>
<li>and transfer rates through varied mediums,</li>
<li>sphere dynamics,</li>
<li>the patterns within the movements caused by existing physical geographical patterns</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>plus the random interaction between the Earth and various celestial bodies that have happened into our path over time, creating such geological features as the gulf of Mexico, the pool of nickel under Sudbury, etc.
.  </li>
</ul>

<p>And therefor the shape of mountains and valleys, continent and ice cap are existential in nature.  Random compared to other regards, such as other universal interaction to the Milky Way, or the shape and position and relative density of the various parts of the superclusters Laniakea and Perseus.</p>

<p>This is I believe accepted as the depth to which the situation has been considered?  Or it has been considered further with less information and been decided non-consequential, perhaps (ie declining influence of gravitational force over distance)?</p>

<p>Some of the things within this frame-work of cumulative understandings, that I see as ""unknown"", ""not clearly known"", ""potential factors"", ""assumptions"", ""theories"" that are in contention"", or ""flat out Scooby Doo mysteries"" are many and of significant value in consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nature of the insides of an atom (now believed filled with Quanta energy field, the ratio of this energy to the mass energy of the sub components of the atom are massive), </li>
<li>the nature of the insides of space (now believed ""filled"" with Dark Matter and Dark Energy equalling 95-96 percent of existence, squishing the 4% we see, know, and understand, into a pretty small corner.</li>
<li>the nature of the ""shape"" of gravity, sought by IBEX, being re-sought by the Planck mission</li>
<li>the nature of the ""shape"" of the Universe, (we have only in the past decade ""perceived documented and published"" details of the super-clusters existence.  It is built on current understanding which include above noted lack of understanding.</li>
<li>the nature of the origins of the Universe (the existence of the superclusters pretty much rule out the ""viability of the truth of the Big Bang Theory (R.I.P.)</li>
<li>the cause of the Milankovitch cycles ranges, parameters, timing, (causes I think)??</li>
<li>the rate of disassembly of Pangea and recreation into the predicted PangeaUltima.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so it is recognition of these conditions combined that begged me to ask the question...Is it known what determines the RATE with which plate tectonics occur?</p>

<p>The true underlying cause of the timing.</p>

<p>And as far as I can tell the best answer is circumstantial existence combined with the Sun and the moon.</p>

"How many trees would I have to plant to solve Global Warming?","<p>According to Nasa, <a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/"">causes of the Earth's greenhouse effect</a> include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs.  Carbon dioxide gets the most press, and NASA's page says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived ""forcing"" of climate change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/benefits.htm"">An article</a> by NC State University says that a healthy tree can store 13 pounds of carbon per year.  As I understand it, carbon dioxide is processed by the tree: the carbon is stored, and the oxygen released.</p>

<p>Given that, how many trees would I need to plant to solve the global climate change crisis?  Should I optimize for a specific type of tree, or would pine work as well as oak or black walnut?</p>

"What causes lava eruptions (and shutoffs)?","<p>I understand the process of volcanism and the reason for magma deposition on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>What is not clear to me, or what seems to be less well explained is why eruptions occur and then stop. What is the operative cause or causes of a flow to start or stop?</p>

<p>As far as my understanding goes there would seem to be two possible obvious explanations:</p>

<p>(1) The magma rises in bubbles, like a lava lamp, through the earth, so the flow begins when the bubble reaches the surface and stops when the bubble is exhausted.</p>

<p>(2) The magma rises as a constant stream, but causes earth to build up around the stream, eventually snuffing it out by mass accumulation. In this explanation, the lava constantly searches for thin spots where it erupts until it blocks itself off, then the pressure forces its way through some new location.</p>

<p>Are either or both of these explanations correct or incorrect? Is there a mechanism I have not considered?</p>

"Need help understanding rain rate formulas from drop sizes","<p>I have come across different formulas by which the rain rate [mm/s] or [mm/h] can be computed from the drop size distribution.
I'm somehow unable to convert the different formulas into each other. It is maybe a stupid question with some unit error, but I cannot find it.</p>

<p>A well-known formula seems:
\begin{equation}R_1 = \frac{\pi}{6} \int_0^{\infty} v(D) D^3 N(D) dD
\end{equation}
This should be the instantaneous rain rate in [mm/s]?? Unfortunately most publications just quote the formula without units...</p>

<p>I'm supposing that $D$ is in [mm], $N(D)$ in [mm$^{-1}$ m$^{-3}$], and $v(D)$ in [m s$^{-1}$].</p>

<p>$v(D)$ is usually approximated as $3.778\cdot D^{0.67}$.</p>

<p>Another formula I have come across is 
\begin{equation}
R_2 = 6\pi \cdot 10^{-4} \int_0^{\infty} v(D) D^3 N(D) dD,
\end{equation}
which is said to be [mm/h], then.
Also for $D$ in [mm], $N(D)$ in [mm$^{-1}$ m$^{-3}$], and $v(D)$ in [m s$^{-1}$].</p>

<p>Now apparently $R_1 \cdot 0.0036 = R_2$. But why?</p>

<p>If $R_1$ is in [mm/s], then we should multiply by 3600 to get to [mm/h].
Can someone spot where I am wrong?
Is it right that $R_1$ is in [mm/s]? (given the units of D, N(D) as above)</p>

"Does climate change cause increase in co2?","<p>My main question is how do we know that increase in global temperature does not CAUSE an increase in co2 concentration?</p>

<p>I am trying to develop my mental model of what's going on for the climate change issue.  There is definitely a correlation between global temperature and co2 concentration, this is not disputed.  The general consensus is that co2 increase causes temperature increase, why is the reverse situation not studied (if it is I could not find any studies).</p>

<p>This thought comes from the statement I've seen that water vapor concentration is more correlated to global temperature  than co2, but this is intuitive since warmer air holds more water vapor than colder air.  Does the same intuition hold for co2?</p>

"How accurate are climate models?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""All models are wrong but some are useful""</a>. I am not against the concept of anthropogenic climate change because climate models may not be strong source of information for climate change. Observation data in the last 30 years or more are enough to prove that human related emissions are affecting the radiative and thermal properties of land, ocean and atmosphere. This question is about climate models which are based on approximations in so many ways.  I am deeply concerned that most modelers tune their models for the right or wrong reasons to produce ""quality"" publications on peer-reviewed journals. They seem to say, ""look at my model, it perfectly reproduced what is observed"". But we know that, there are so many approximations for turbulence, micro-physics, land surface fluxes, and so forth. The numerical solution approximation by itself imposes serious limit to the accuracy of climate models. Some manuscripts that I found are ""too accurate to be true"". Then my question is how accurate can a climate model be? Are there methods to check the accuracy of those publications claiming to be true?   </p>

<p>Edit: This question is broad and it requires broad answer based on  uncertainties imposed on climate models by approximations at each level of the model development and indicate the maximum  achievable accuracy level. In my mind something like the following conceptual figure.</p>

<p>However, when one considers the weight of the overlying rock, especially if a sill has formed up to several kilometres below the surface, is it the case that the strata and rocks immediately beneath the growing, injected magma layer were <em>sinking</em>, i.e. a descent of the lower solid layer(s) — with magma being injected from somewhere via fissures, etc., to form the sill above — until static equilibrium was achieved? Or did the pressure from the injected magma layer cause the overlying rocks — and therefore the ground surface — to be forced up?</p>

"In hydrology, what's the difference between specific and total catchment area?","<p>I am getting stuck on the concepts of Total Catchment Area (TCA) and Specific Catchment Area (SCA) as I try to learn more about <a href=""http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:TOPMODEL"" rel=""noreferrer"">TOPMODEL</a> and hydrology modeling. What do these metrics mean in hydrology? The context I encounter these in is in calculating Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) values. </p>

<p>My understanding so far is that: TCA is basically equivalent to a watershed for any given pour point; SCA helps determine saturation and saturation excess flow and it is the ratio of a local catchment area for a pour point divided by the width of the contour where that pour point is. I'm especially uncertain about SCA because it's unclear to me how the width of the contour is involved in a catchment area (based on my conceptual framework of a watershed a/k/a catchment area being defined by a single pour point). So, maybe I also need ""Flow Width"" (a term I think I've seen used to describe that contour width used in SCA) to be explained in order to understand SCA.</p>

<p>To give some context to what I'm referring to, here's a passage which references both TCA and SCA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Upslope area is the <em>total catchment area</em> above a point or length of contour and the <em>specific catchment area</em> is the upslope area per width of contour or cell size, <em>L</em> (Moore <em>et al.</em>, 1991). <em>Specific catchment area</em> is used to calculate saturation and saturation excess overland flow in hydrological models such as TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979) and, along with other topographic indices, to calculate erosion and landsliding in many other models. Upslope area is commonly used for mapping channels on the basis of threshold upslope areas for channel initiation.</p>

At the same time, forest area expanded in some places, either through planting or natural processes, bringing the global net loss of forest to 8.3 million hectares per year.  In the first decade of this century, the rate of deforestation was slightly lower, but still, a disturbingly high 13 million hectares were destroyed annually. As forest expansion remained stable, the global net forest loss between 2000 and 2010 was 5.2 million hectares per year. </p>

"What causes the counter-intuitive presence of CO2 in the atmosphere during spring and summer months?","<p>Recently, I stumbled upon this NASA map of the Earth from the OCO-2, a satellite that measures CO<sub>2</sub> density in the atmosphere. <a href=""http://www.climatecentral.org/news/nasa-tools-co2-19681"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.climatecentral.org/news/nasa-tools-co2-19681</a> Specifically, I'm refering to the tool with the CO<sub>2</sub> heat map with the split-screen slider.</p>

<p>As you can see during the spring, there is less CO<sub>2</sub> over open ocean and higher CO<sub>2</sub> over landmasses. During the summer, (by the naked eye) there seems to be a higher CO<sub>2</sub> density across the path the satellite took. I'm curious the reason for the differences we see.</p>

<p>I would expect that during the summer months, when there is a higher density of CO<sub>2</sub> , that there would be a lower density of CO<sub>2</sub> because of an overall increase in vegetation. During the spring, there would be more CO<sub>2</sub> because of a significant decrease in vegetation and increase in energy consumption in the Northern Hemisphere (but not as much as during heavy winter). </p>

<p>Am I making a wrong assumption? What am I missing?</p>

<p>I think this is a distinct question from <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/2521/why-is-there-a-seasonal-cycle-to-the-amount-of-co2-in-the-atmosphere"">this one</a> because I'm asking only in the scope of one year or across consecutive seasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the past 20 years in his research at Boston University, <strong>El-Baz has utilized satellite images to better understand the origin and evolution of desert landforms. He is credited with providing evidence that the desert is not man-made, but the result of major climatic variations.</strong> His research uncovered numerous sand-buried rivers and streams in the Sahara based on the interpretation of radar images.</p>
  
  <p>These former water courses lead into depressions in the terrain, which he theorized must contain groundwater. His analysis of these data resulted in the location of groundwater in the arid terrains of Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and perhaps Darfur in Sudan (unless it dried up).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A staggering 250,000 cubic meters (8.8 million cubic feet) of ice could break away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses mountain in the Mont Blanc massif, experts at the Valle d'Aosta regional government and the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) <a href=""http://www.comune.courmayeur.ao.it/comune/news_scheda.php?acc=&amp;nId=1263"" rel=""noreferrer"">reported</a> in an analysis published this week.</p>
  
  <p>While it's impossible to predict the exact timing of the <strong>collapse</strong>, observations in August and September showed that the glacier was shifting at a speed of 50 to 60 centimeters (20 to 24 inches) a day, experts said.</p>
  
  <p>""These phenomena once again show that the mountain is going through a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,"" Stefano Miserocchi, mayor of nearby Courmayeur, <a href=""http://www.comune.courmayeur.ao.it/comune/news_scheda.php?acc=&amp;nId=1263"" rel=""noreferrer"">said in a statement</a>.

Do you need industrial use of hundreds of meters cubed? Typically how vulnerable are they to depletion by people. Is there a lot of variability in size, or are they usually fairly large? Does it take months, years, decades?</p>

"How is climate change today different than the climate change that ended the ice age(s)?","<p>Someone I know posted a question about climate change that I do not know how to answer.

<blockquote>
  <p>If climate change is not a natural phenomenon, then how did the last
  ice age end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person is implying that warming/cooling reoccurs periodically on the Earth, and that the current climate change threat is overblown.</p>

<p>I have searched online for answers, but cannot find anything concise on this specific subject. According to this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age#Causes"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikipedia article</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is evidence that greenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice
  ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is
  difficult to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the
  role of weathering). Greenhouse gas levels may also have been affected
  by other factors which have been proposed as causes of ice ages, such
  as the movement of continents and volcanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, how and why did the last ice ages end?

"With so many positive feedbacks accelerating global warming, how did the earth ever re-enter ice ages after it came out of one?","<p>We hear a lot about positive feedbacks when it comes to global warming.

"Are nutrient cycles described in terms of a level of health or of degradation?","<p>Nutrient cycles such as the carbon cycle, water cycle, or nitrogen cycle underlie much of our day-to-day, year-to-year activities and well-being. <strong>Is there a term or system of assessing how ""healthy"" or not nutrient cycles are for humanity or for net primary productivity overall?</strong> It's clear that certain qualities of storages and flows will either make life pretty good for us and other organisms, or make things pretty bad for us. I'm just not sure how to refer to that fact. <strong>Do experts in this field refer to nutrient cycles as being 'degraded' or 'restored', or how is it referred to?</strong></p>

<p>Below paragraphs are just examples to clarify what I'm trying to get a vocabulary for regarding nutrient cycles.</p>

<hr>

<p>The water cycle is an obvious example of this, where we need a <em>goldilocks zone</em> amount of water to thrive; too much water in the form of runoff, flooding, and erosion and we end up with numerous environmental costs or even loss of suitable habitat, too little water in the form of drought or degraded water quality and we end up with numerous environmental costs or even loss of suitable habitat. How do we refer to the water cycle that is suitable or unsuitable for us? What is it called when the nutrient cycle is altered to become better (I'd think ""restored"") or worse (""degraded"")?</p>

<p>Nitrogen or carbon are probably the next best example cycles. On a global scale we are doing pretty major alterations to the natural flows and storages of these elements. On the one hand, pulling so much carbon out of long-term storages has benefited us in vast and various ways, but these benefits may be relatively short-lived if we <em>degraded the nutrient cycle</em> to the point that it worsens our habitat and strains our economies around the world. </p>

<p>Here are the most relevant excerpts in case the link breaks at some point in the future. This is from 2003.</p>

<p>There is one instance of ""transparent cloud"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The one-minute average of the electric field mill network may not exceed -1 or +1 kilovolt per meter within five nautical miles of the launch pad or the lightning flash at any time within 15 minutes prior to launch. This field mill criteria becomes -1.5 or + 1.5 kilovolts per meter if there are no clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path except those which are transparent. Also excepted are clouds with tops below the 41 degrees F. temperature level that have not have been previously associated with a thunderstorm, or associated with convective clouds having tops above the 14 degrees F. temperature level during the last three hours. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as a whole section on non-transparent clouds and parts of clouds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clouds: (types known to contain hazardous electric fields)</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Do not launch if the flight path is through any non-transparent clouds that extend to altitudes at or above the 32 degrees F. level which are associated with disturbed weather producing moderate or greater precipitation, or melting precipitation, within five nautical miles of the flight path.</p></li>
  <li><p>Do not launch through an attached anvil cloud. If lightning occurs in the anvil or the associated main cloud, do not launch within 10 nautical miles for the first 30 minutes after lightning is observed, or within 5 nautical miles from 30 minutes to 3 hours after lightning is observed. </p></li>
  <li><p>Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle:</p>
  
  <p>a) through non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first three hours after the anvil detaches from the parent cloud, or the first four hours after the last lightning occurs in the detached anvil.</p>
  
  <p>b)  10 nautical miles of non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first thirty minutes after the time of the last lightning in the parent or anvil cloud before detachment, or the detached anvil after its detachment.</p>
  
  <p>c) within 5 nautical miles of non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first three hours after the time of the last lightning in the parent or anvil cloud before detachment, or the detached anvil after detachment, unless there is a field mill within 5 nautical miles of the detached anvil reading less than 1,000 volts per meter for the last 15 minutes and a maximum radar returns from any part of the detached anvil within 5 nautical miles of the flight path have been less than 10 dBZ on radar (light rain) for 15 minutes. </p></li>
  <li><p>Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle through a thunderstorm or cumulonimbus debris cloud which is not transparent and less than three hours old. Launch may not occur within five nautical miles of these debris clouds unless: 1) for 15 minutes preceding launch there is at least one working field mill within five nautical miles of the debris cloud; 2) all electric field mill readings are between -1 kilovolt and + 1 kilovolt per meter within five nautical miles of the flight path; 3) no precipitation has been detected in the debris cloud (less than 10 dbz by radar) within 5 nautical miles of the flight path. </p></li>

"Why is a future increase in solar luminosity by 10% supposed to have disastrous consequences for life on earth when the last 30% did not?","<p>One remarkable thing about the climate history of earth is that despite the fact that solar luminosity was fully 30% lower in the beginning, temperatures were actually quite close to today. Since then temperatures have stayed in a relatively narrow range, allowing life to develop. This lets one conclude that there are dampening mechanisms in the earths climate system.  </p>

<p>But predictions for the next few 100 millions of years are unequivocal that the about 10% increase of solar illumination will massively increase temperatures on earth, leading to annihilation of at least all higher life (For details, see for instance here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Solar_evolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Solar_evolution</a>, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131216142310.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">When will Earth lose its oceans?</a>) </p>

<p>Now, it stands to reason that at some point the climate dampening mechanisms will be overwhelmed by additional solar irradiation. But there is no indication that the next 10% will be it, if at all the last 500 million years seem to indicate a trend to cooler temperatures: </p>

<p>So what is it that we're seeing when we start seeing the curvature once we're high enough?

"Why is my pond / lake melting when the temperature is still far below freezing?","<p>I recently moved into a new house with a 2 acre lake behind it. We’ve had 15 consecutive days below freezing, and the last 12 of those have been below 20 degrees (Fahrenheit)! Six days ago I shoveled off a small spot to test out whether it would be good to ice skate on the surface, with the plan that yesterday I would shovel off a much bigger area. Yesterday morning, however, I woke up to a big area straight across starting to melt! The temperature was about 5 degrees F. This morning it’s even larger. The temperature did not exceed 20 degrees yesterday. Though there has been frigid cold it has been sunny. Is it possible that the area I shoveled caused this? The rest of the lake looks exactly the same (About 2” of snow all over it. No signs of melting anywhere else.) I’ve attached before and after pictures.

"What determines the spatial resolution of a study?","<p>This might sound like a silly question to many of you, but I am addressing the comments of a referee regarding a study I'm trying to publish and I remained a little puzzled about this issue.</p>

<p>Let's assume I have set up a simplified model that processes biophysical and socioeconomic data to analyze an issue attaining water management. Biophysical data (mainly topographic, climatic, and hydrological) are available at relatively high resolution (0.25 or 0.5 degree), while socioeconomic data are available at country resolution. The model was set up to run at gridcell resolution (0.25 degree), but, of course, all the cells of the same country share the same values of the socio-economic variables. However the process is run for each individual cell and the results are different from cell to cell, even in the same country.</p>

<p>In my manuscript, I claim that the resolution of my study is a quarter degree. This sentence is contested by a referee that states: ""<em>The resolution of the results of a given study is actually defined by the coarsest dataset that the study uses (not the finest). Part of the data used are available only at country level, so the spatial resolution of their results is at that level, not finer</em>.""</p>

<p>Now, I understand that coarse biophysical data (precipitation, temperature, land use, ....) should be eventually downscaled to be used in a gridded modeling approach, but what about variables like ""<em>corruption</em>"" or ""<em>quality of the institutions</em>""? Does a downscaling of such variables make any sort of sense? 
What finally determines the spatial resolution of a study?</p>

"Can I use radar data to estimate snowfall, or is there a better way?","<p><strong>The problem</strong>:  There are lots of websites that provide snow forecasts for various ski resorts.  The area of interest to me is Japan, specifically the Nagano area, where I use snow-forecast.com and www.windyty.com to get fairly accurate snow forecasts at elevation for the resorts I'm interested in, and in the case of Windy, also for other mountain peaks outside of the ski resorts.</p>

<p>However, unsurprisingly, often in the morning it turns out that the forecasts are not always perfect.  In fact, they can often be way off.  Sometimes a big storm never materializes, and sometimes it affects only certain areas.</p>

<p>The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) has public hourly weather station data, but the weather stations tend to be down in towns, rather than on mountain peaks, and are not necessarily near the ski resorts in question.</p>

<p>My solution at the moment is to frequently check the radar during storms, watching hour by hour to see which areas are being affected by the storm, correlate it with the weather station data, and try to make a prediction about which resorts are getting the most snow.  Needless to say, this is fairly time consuming and often misses some things (if the storm is a surprise, if there is a big storm somewhere that I'm not checking).</p>

<p><strong>My proposed solution:</strong>  Write a script to screen scrape the radar images from the JMA and watch the pixel values of the areas in question, considering the pixel values to be a function of mm precip/hour, and taking the integral of the pixel function over time to get a <em>rough estimate</em> of total mm precip over the past 24 hours.  I can probably then use other data at the weather stations to fit a function to calculate estimated snowfall from mm precip, elevation, and temperature.  It obviously will be pretty inaccurate, but at least it should be able to tell me with a decent degree of certainty whether there is no snow, a little bit, a lot, or tons, which is the only degree of accuracy I need.</p>

<p><strong>Questions about my proposal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it more or less a sound idea?</li>
<li>Does this data (""snow accumulation in the past 12-24 hours at an arbitrary lat/lon position"") already exist somewhere that I don't know about?</li>
<li>Is there more accurate source of radar data somewhere?  I'm currently screen scraping the JMA website to download the images, then sampling the image pixel values to get the mm precip at a given position, but the data has already been discretized, presumably for aesthetic reasons.  I would way rather just pay someone for access to a web service that will take the lat/lon and a timestamp and spit out a more accurate number.</li>
<li>Is there an easier way to do this that I'm missing?</li>

"Would the enthalpy of fusion for melting ice fields be a causative factor for colder winter weather?","<p>Would the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enthalpy of fusion</a> for melting ice fields be a causative factor for colder winter weather?</p>

<p>As an example, NASA estimated the annual loss of the Greenland ice field 2002-2013 as more than 280 gigatons, and apparently increasing.  Would the energy required for state transition on such a scale be a causitve factor in colder weather during a period of warming climate?</p>

<p>UPDATED:  My wording above was too generalized and I got good answers to a question slightly different than the one I intended.  Retry:
According to Wikipedia, one of the vortices of the northern Polar vortex is Baffin Island, very near Greenland.  The recent unusually cold weather in the eastern US has been attributed to the path of the Polar Vortex this year. My question should have been ""could the energy required for state transition of the Greenland ice field contributed to the change in path of the Northern Polar Vortex this year?""</p>

"How much silicon is in the Earth's core, and how did it get there?","<p>With some informal conversation with a peer of mine, he had suggested that there is evidence (which he couldn't find,but had remembered reading) that there was Silicon in the Earth's core. I referred to him to a rather famous paper by Micheal Drake which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Further, there is no compelling experimental evidence that Si is extracted into the core under present core-mantle boundary conditions. For example, at the base of a high pressure/temperature terrestrial magma ocean, the metal/silicate partition coefficent for Si is approximately $10^{-3}$ to  $10^{-2}$""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since this paper was published 12 years ago, I am wondering if there is any compelling evidence that Si is in Earth's core, and at what concentration it might be? How might it have gotten there? </p>

"Standardized scale for coastline length or mapping in general?","<p>Measuring the length of a coastline depends on the scale of the measuring tool. The smaller the scale of your tool, the longer will your measured coastline be. The reason for this is the fractal property of coastlines.

"What are the causes of lower UV radiation at lower elevations?","<p>After recently visiting the Dead Sea in Israel and not getting any skin burns, I was wondering about the reasons for that. Searching the literature, it seems that the UV radiation is indeed lower in the Dead Sea (<em>ca</em>. -400 m) compared to Beer Sheva (a nearby city at <em>ca</em>. +300 m): <a href=""http://solarlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IJC1997.pdf"">1</a> <a href=""http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ANHM/issue/view/2251/showToc"">2</a> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1158663"">3</a>. Both UVA and UVB rays are lower, but UVB rays are attenuated the most.</p>

<p>These sources give mostly measurements, but hardly discuss the reasons for the lower radiation. I always thought that the ozone layer blocks most of the UV radiation, but here it seems that just a few hundred meters of atmosphere can greatly reduce the amount of incident UV.</p>

<p>What are the reasons for that? Is it simply because there are more air molecules that absorb the radiation?</p>

"Would it be wise to monitor real time human activity to anticipate earthquakes?","<p>Documented strange behaviors of animals before an earthquake could invite us to believe that some of them anticipate tectonic activity.

"Strangely bright morning twilight over Switzerland","<p>Yesterday morning (04.11.2014) I woke up at 6:40 as usual and noticed that it was relatively bright out. I had a better look around 7 and concluded that it was definitely quite a bit brighter than it was the day before at that time. There was also a strange, yellow tint to the light.</p>

<p>I looked up <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/switzerland/basel"" rel=""nofollow"">when the sun comes up in Basel</a> (where I live) and found out it's at 7:18.

"Understanding the Mercator Projection","<p>To illustrate my problem, let's say I have lattitude and longitude coordinates, such as 38.871105, -77.056042.

"Trewartha climate classification overlap?","<p>By my reading of the wikipedia page on the Trewartha climate classification, climate classifications are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the climate classification of Iowa City, IA.</p>

<p>The Trewartha precipitation limit is defined as 10(T-10)+3P, where T is the mean annual temperature and P is the percentage of the annual precipitation occurring in the six high-sun months. In the northern hemisphere, this is Apr—Sep.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=97037&amp;cityname=Iowa-City-Iowa-United-States-of-America&amp;units=us"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Using the data publicly available on weatherbase.com</a>, the Trewartha precipitation limit is 608.23 mm. Twice that is 1216.46 mm.</p>

<p>BW (desert) climates are defined by mean annual precipitation below the original threshold (608.23 mm for Iowa City), BS (steppe) climates are defined by mean annual precipitation above the original threshold but less than twice the threshold (1216.46 mm for Iowa City), and if mean annual precipitation exceeds twice the threshold then the climate is not classified as B (dry). Iowa City's mean annual precipitation is 922.2 mm, earning it a BS (steppe) classification.</p>

<p>However, Iowa City also satisfies the definition of a Dca (hot-summer continental) climate under the Trewartha climate classification:</p>

<ul>
<li>4-7 months with mean monthly temperature above 50 degrees (F). Iowa City has 7 (all of Apr—Oct)</li>
<li>Coldest monthly mean temperature below 32 degrees (F). Iowa City's is 22.1 degrees (F) in Jan.</li>
<li>Warmest monthly mean temperature above 72 degrees (F). Iowa City's is 74.8 degrees (F) in Jul.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question is...under the Trewartha climate classification, is Iowa City, IA classified as a BS (steppe) climate, a Dca (hot-summer continental) climate, or both?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It's come to my attention that I incorrectly used Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for the mean annual temperature, and that Iowa City, IA therefore does not actually lie within a BS (steppe) climate zone. I'm going to leave the original question, though: what happens when a climate meets the criteria for more than one zone?</p>

"What is the best way to stay safe while photographing lightning storms?","<p>Occasionally, I go out with my camera and tripod and capture cumulonimbus clouds from distance.

<p>A nice example of lightning comming out of cumulonimbus anvil - I've heard that you can even be hit hundreds of kilometres away (but it's extremely unlikely).</p>

<p>Additionally, I know that during thunderstorms it is very dangerous just to stay in contact with metals or water. This is why I never go out (or open windows) when I take photos of lightning from my flat. But... I have seen several amazing captures of lightning by storm chasers. How is it that they are so close to lightning, but do not get struck? Is there any trick or are they simply risking their lives?  </p>

<p>I've considered how lightning strikes, and drew this image.  In this situation it seems that there are three possible targets. I drew a radius around each object because it my intuition suggests it would work like this.  If so, then the building on top of the hill has the highest probability of being struck.</p>

<p>If the lightning bolt hits the object closest to its path, could we completely protect ourselves from being struck by staying RELATIVELY close to some much taller objects, so that they would cover the sky around us with their large radius?</p>

<p>I would like to stay in safe, but take some beautiful photos of lightning too.  I know everyone says that ""during lightning storms you should never stand under trees"". But if located right, can you actually be protected from danger like this?  Or what practices are truly the best way to stay safe while photographing lightning storms?</p>

"Is non-randomly-sampled historical data representative?","<p>I'm a global warming skeptic, and one of my concerns is the accuracy of historical global temperatures. Since these temperatures weren't sampled at random locations or gridded points, can they be considered an accurate representation of ""global temperature""?</p>

<p>Thoughts/etc:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982162/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982162/</a> talks about this in a temporal sense, since using the average of the minimum and maximum daily temperatures at a given location isn't really a great way of determining average temperature. However, it doesn't discuss geographical random sampling/gridding.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4580/full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4580/full</a> notes this problem exists, and takes uniformly gridded measurements, but it's limited to a specific region and time period (1979-2012).</p></li>
<li><p>I know climate scientists slice the Earth up into grids to avoid clustering bias, but that's not the same thing, and isn't useful if the original readings don't accurately represent the slice/region.</p></li>
<li><p>I also realize that climate scientists have other measures of global warming, but linear regression of actual temperature measurements seems to be the most used to convince the public, so their accuracy seems important.</p></li>
<li><p>As a skeptic, I'd also like to know if, in general, most of the arguments for global warming are statistical in nature (ie, linear regression on measured variables), or the statistical ones are just the most ""photogenic"" for public consumption? In other words, is the whole non-randomly-sampled/gridded temperature argument a red herring?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT (to clarify question):</p>

<p>To determine the Earth's mean surface temperature, we can employ one of these methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Measure the Earth's temperature at every point and average. Of course, this is physically impossible, since a point is a 0-dimensional mathematical abstraction, but we can do something close with satellites.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a large number of random points on the Earth's surface (this random distribution is uniform in longitude, but not in latitude-- in latitude, it would look like a cosine curve), measure the temperature, and average. In addition to giving us a mean, it would give us a standard deviation so we can say ""we are 95% confident that the Earth's true mean temperature is X plus or minus Y"".</p></li>
<li><p>Take a uniformly spaced grid (non trivial, since the distance between longitudes vary by latitude), measure the temperature at those points and average. This is similar to the first approach, but with fewer points. Unless we believe our grid points introduce a bias, this should be as accurate as random sampling.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My problem: temperature measurements in the past were made using NONE of these methods. The points where temperature was measured were not chosen randomly or in a gridded fashion. Therefore, how can they be an accurate measurement of historical temperature, even if we only consider temperature changes?</p>

<p>NOTE: I realize surface temperature isn't the best measure of global warming, since water has a much higher specific heat than land (among other things), but that's my focus for this question.</p>

<p>But it would seem useful for a lot of folks, whether tens of miles downsource of a mountain stream (such as might've been vital as the <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/01/40-years-after-big-thompson-flood/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Big Thompson flood</a> started), dozens of miles down a valley from a dammed waterway (like those further down the Feather/Sacramento Rivers tonight), or hundreds of miles down a flooding major river (such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1993"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the 1993 Mississippi Flood</a>), especially given the varying warning networks in place around the world, to have a rough scale of how quickly an unexpected flood might translate downstream their way.  Is it a matter of hours, days, weeks?  A rough worst-case scenario of how quickly they may have to react is what is desired.</p>

<p>Would seem a reasonable formula for a loose estimate might reasonably include the volume of water flowing, the expected channel size, and the elevation change (or alternatively, just the speed of the water... but if you knew that, you really don't need any special formula!).</p>

<p>Does such a formula like this exist?<br>
Or are there good empirical estimates for those different situations I presented?<br>
Or is each case just so unique that there's no hope of such an estimate?</p>

"Is plate tectonics a hoax theory? How can tightly packed plates move?","<p>Here are two questions I had ever since I first heard about plate-tectonics.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can the plates move? Before you suggest me some page to read about plate movement mechanics, let me clarify that I am not asking about the mechanics behind plate movement here. But I am talking about the physical possibility of plate movement.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we look at the map of plates, all of them are tightly packed, with not an inch of space or gap to move. The complex shape of surrounding plates, blocks all freedom of movement. Then how can the theory say that plates can move?</p>

<p>If you can't follow my explanation, consider a jigsaw puzzle in which the blocks are correctly set up. Can we move a block from the middle now? We can not because the blocks are tightly interlocked, and because of their complex shape. The same is the situation here too, in fact much more complex! Each plates is tightly surrounded by complex shaped other plates, making any movement in any direction impossible!</p>

<p>See the below given a map of tectonic plates for example. It is evident the plates are actually interlocked so tightly that, it is impossible to move in any direction, because of the presence of another plate in opposite direction. There is no freedom of movement available, in any direction! The complex shape of plates make movements impossible!  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvVHW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvVHW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>My second question is this: It is said that, all continents were a single large continent millions of years ago. And then much later, continents 'drifted away', reaching current shape and locations.</li>
</ol>

<p>If tectonic plates does not even have hundreds of miles of gaps between them to move, how can continents drift away so far, even thousands of miles away?  Certainly plates can't move this far, because the whole earth surface is divided into plates, with no space left for plates to move thousands of miles.</p>

<p>So how did the continents drift away this far? Or do we have to assume that continents are simply floating over the tectonic plates?</p>

<p>Is the plate tectonics theory a complete hoax?</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong>: The largest intact portion of the rock is about 2.2 cm in diameter.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: 
It's a somewhat heterogeneous black/grey/white rock with clear/white crystalline structures and blacker mica-like cleavage layers. The rock is <em>very</em> brittle (you can see ""crumbs"" in the photos generated from simply setting the rock down and rotating it to take photos). However, given the brittleness, I'd say it's actually more dense/heavy than I would expect based on its size.</p>

"How to characterize flow of nonreactive tracer in a porous media?","<h3>About Tracer Experiment</h3>

<p>This experiment is conducted by injecting a fluid with nonreactive species of certain concentration inside a column or core composed of sand. The injection of fluid can either be in the form of a pulse or it can be continuous injection. This type of experiment can be useful to characterize the static and dynamic properties of a subsurface and can help us gain a better understanding of the geology and flow dynamics of the fluid. </p>

<h3>Known Information</h3>

<p>In this type of experiment we typically know the velocity of the tracer through the column, say $v$, the length of the column $L$, the injected concentration of the tracer $C_0$, a time series of the fluid concentration at the column outlet $C$ $\text{vs.}$ $t$, which acts as an output data from this experiment. </p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Which equations are typically used to characterize the flow of
nonreactive tracer in a porous media at laboratory scale?  </li>
<li>How can we use the known information to estimate the fluid dispersion coefficient (a measure of fluid velocity variance)?</li>

"Which component in a 3-component Sp receiver function is the actual Sp RF?","<p>In a 3-component Sp RF I have the green's function in P,SV, and SH. The actual component to the RF that shows the Sp conversion (the one always published in the literature), which would represent as a negative phase around the LAB and a big positive one over the Moho, would have to be the P component...right? I have three components to these RFs, but they were never labeled, two of them have the zero lag arrival at the same exact time while the third has its zero lag arrival occur about 3 seconds before the other two. Remember this is an Sp RF! </p>

<p>As an S wave in an non-isotropic (i.e. Earth) media would have some level of energy in two components, SV and SH (albeit the SH is always a lower SNR given the Earth is not actually isotropic), it completely makes sense that the two components in the receiver function that happen to have the zero lag direct arrival of the wave at the EXACT same time would have to be the SV and SH components. </p>

<p>Given that one of these two has a much lower SNR I could also argue which one is SV and which one is SH. Furthermore, since the only remaining component has its direct arrival occur BEFORE the other two I should naturally conclude this to be the P component! ....but this is where it gets complicated....this supposed P component does not have a clear positive spike where the Moho should be and a clear negative spike where the LAB should be.....the supposed SV component does....</p>

"Why more matters appear in hot equator, when they should flow to the cold poles?","<p>I am reading a paper* about the application of the maximum entropy production (MEP) in Earth science (I'm new to MEP btw). The authors start with the system of gas molecules first. When the system is isolated, it has the maximum entropy and the molecules are distributed randomly. When it get contacted with the hot reservoir, nearby molecules will have higher energy, therefore moving faster and will tend to move to the other side, while colder molecules are not really active, so they will stay in their positions. As a consequence. the molecules will shift to the cold side.</p>

The accuracy of the wind and the temperature profile are considered to be the most important indicators of the model's skill.  An Eulerian grid model is then be used to represent air pollutant dispersion.</p>

<p>There have historically been discussions of problems with the model in places where there is complex terrain, and whether a finer-scale horizontal grid spacing would solve the issues (e.g. unable to capture local effects in the wind field or PBL). However, now there are models that are configured with the lowest recommended grid-spacing (1/3 km) and many more complex local weather patterns are being accurately modeled. I've been told that the models don't do well with grid-spacings any finer than 1/3 km.

"The Dust Bowl: how's the recovery of all that topsoil going?","<p>I must admit this is very confusing: one gets different types of information from different sources that often contradict one another.</p>

<p>It is said that the main event occurred due to some misguided farming practices; that those practices allowed strong winds to pick up all the topsoil in the area, carry it east, and deposit it into the Atlantic, more or less in toto. This may not be altogether accurate, but that's the impression one gets from reading essays, articles, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl"">Wikipedia entry pertaining to the Dust Bowl</a>.</p>

<p>That said, various sources maintain that it takes 500 years or more to form 1 inch of topsoil.</p>

<p>Others suggest coyly that the process can be expedited artificially by burying lots of organic garbage and introducing earthworms to it: a few years of this, and voila - we've got topsoil! (Few of them say how many years, exactly, and where's one supposed to get all those earthworms?)</p>

<p>Still other sources say that because of soil erosion and other intriguing factors we may be running out of arable land. And not just in Kansas either, but all over the globe.</p>

<p>With all of the above in mind, my question is: have the areas affected by the Dust Bowl recovered partially, completely, or not at all? How much of that land can be classified as arable once again?</p>

"ERA Interim, how to handle total precipitation","<p>I am trying to compute accumulated annual precipitation for year 2000-2001 based on the ERA Interim, but I am stuck with some unresolved questions:</p>

<p>If I download the synoptic monthly means of ""total precipitation"" from ECMWF for year 2000-2001 with ""Select time"" set to ""00:00:00"" and ""12:00:00"" respectively, and chose ""Select step"" as ""3"", I get a *.nc -file with 48 time steps. The file also contains a ""scale_factor"" and ""add_offset"". I assume that I must use those values in (add_offset + (downloaded data * scale_factor)) to get actual precipitation in meters? And I assume that if I sum the 48 time steps of data (corrected with add_offset and scale_factor) and divide by 2 (2 years of data) then I get the average accumulated precipitation per year. Is this correct?</p>

<p>What then puzzles me is that the ""scale_factor"" is very low (3.9E-8), meaning that the values I get will be almost equal to the ""add_offset"" which is 0.0013. Are there any obvious mistakes I make? Or do any of you know of a guide that is more elaborate than the documentation found at ECMWF? </p>

"How to quickly or easily prove the world is spherical?","<p>A relative of mine has recently introduced me to the modern flat earth theory, which she believes in. Setting aside for the moment that it is ridiculous, and that sending up some balloons with cameras on would provide evidence to the contrary, how could one evidence that it is in fact spherical from ground based observation? </p>

<p>I immediately thought about citing the observations of Aristotle and measurements of Eratosthenes, something that one can do themselves, but of course they have an answer for that regarding curving light to explain variation of the sun's elevation with latitude. Also refraction backed up by observations of ships on the horizon appearing to be above the horizon (due to refraction) and so light-based observations of a curved body of water are out. To make it even harder, the belief has been adjusted to allow for a flat earth that curves slightly but is not spherical, so objects gradually disappearing over the horizon aren't proof and neither is observing the curvature from a plane! For every argument there is a counter argument, and I, as a layman, don't know how to prove e.g. that the light isn't curving as described.</p>

<p>Without getting into countering non-scientific flaws such as the massive amount of government-level collusion that would be needed to maintain this conspiracy, how might one go about demonstrating it or designing a practical experiment for which the conclusion cannot be refuted. Is this even possible when someone can claim e.g. light curving through the atmosphere in a particular way, without having to back it up? I'm not familiar enough with scientific theory to know how one establishes certainty, or if it is based on a balance of probability (i.e. more proof of one theory than of the contrary).</p>

<p>Note: This is a thought exercise only, I do not expect to actually convince my relative while she is going through a personal crisis for which this is one of many symptoms, that is a separate issue. She holds a degree in aeronautical engineering so it isn't caused by a lack of intelligence. </p>

"Why does gold and other metals conglomerate","<p>When gold, or some other metals, such as copper, are found, they are often found in large nuggets.

"How different is the proportion of heavy water ($\ce{^2H2O}$) in the different oceans?","<p>The average proportion of naturally occurring semi-heavy water or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water"">deuterated water</a>, $\ce{^2HHO}$ or $\ce{HDO}$, is about 1 molecule in 3200. The proportion comes from the fact that one hydrogen in 6400 is in the form of deuterium. The heavy water, $\ce{D2O}$, proportion is about 1 molecule in 41 million ($\ce{6400^2}$) as part of a dynamic equilibrium between normal water, semi-heavy and heavy water (water containing 50% H and 50% D, is in fact a balance between 25% of $\ce{H2O}$ and $\ce{D2O}$ and the rest is $\ce{HDO}$). 
I understand that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water"">Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW)</a> has a set proportion equal to the average proportion, but heavy water abundance changes slightly from one kind of water to another.</p>

"Local Weather Forecast (Self-Learning Algorithm)","<p><strong><em>First of all, the question!</em></strong> :</p>

<p><em>Is it possible to predict local weather tendencies for the upcoming hours (let's say 2-3 hours) using only local data?
If yes, which data is needed to make such predictions and which predictions are possible?</em></p>

<p>I'm not talking about very precise predictions, just basic stuff like: ""The temperature will rise/drop"" or ""If humidity goes up and air pressure drops, it will probably rain"" etc.. you get the idea.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using data for temperature, air pressure, humidity, time of day and wind speed/direction.. maybe something else?</p>

<p><strong><em>Some Background</em></strong> :</p>

<p>for a little DIY Home-Project I decided it would be an interesting idea to set up a little ""weather station"" in front of my home and collect all sorts of weather related data in short intervalls (e.g. temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed/direction, time of day etc.)</p>

<p>The idea is to collect data over the period of a few months (or more) and to develop an algorithm that is able to predict the upcoming weather with a certain probability.
The result should be a little program that was trained on past data and is then able to predict weather tendencies (Temperature, rain, etc..) using the data of the last couple of hours. Let's say the temperature and the air pressure drop and the humidty rises over a certain period of time, then it should tell me that it will likely rain. </p>

<p>I will not bother you with the details on how to write such a self-learning algorithm, but since I'm not very well educated regarding meteorology I'm not even sure if such predictions are possible or to what extent.</p>

<p>I think you've understood the idea. Please give me your Ideas about it. What's possible what's not. Maybe experiences, which data I need, what predictions i could possibly make and which not and so on.</p>

"How did these grassy hillsides in Colombia become terraced?","<p>In Colombia, many grassy hillsides are terraced, like in the photo below. This terracing also occurs on hillsides that never had these palm trees on them. I assume that it also occurs outside of Colombia. How does this terracing happen?</p>

<p>Just from my first-hand observations, I think the answer is: The terracing was formed by grazing livestock. Grazing livestock is common in these areas, and the barbed wire fence hints that it is occurring here. On flat ground, the livestock wander in random directions. On steep ground, the livestock prefer to follow the hill's contour lines, as that is the easiest path to walk, as opposed to more directly uphill or downhill. When a livestock initiates a contour path on a not-yet-terraced hillside, that path is repeatedly trod by subsequent livestock, as it is a little flatter and easier to walk than other contour paths, eventually leading to significant terracing. The terracing is uneven (not level) because the livestock have to go up or down a bit to graze elsewhere on the hill.</p>

<p>Can anybody confirm my answer, or provide another answer that is objectively correct, preferably with citations? I asked the same question in the form of an <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/90003/how-did-these-grassy-hillsides-become-unevenly-terraced"">SE puzzle</a>, which is currently on hold because ""This question may invite speculative answers, as the question is not fully defined.

"How does extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contribute to radiative forcing?","<p>The CO2 absorption spectrum taken at 200 mmHg partial pressure, beam path length = 10 cm, resolution = 4 cm^-1 shows that light can only travel a couple hundred meters before being completely absorbed by atmospheric CO2 at its absorption peaks.

But the major absorption bands seem to be wider beyond what a few nanometers of broadening could affect. Would these effects have a non-negligible contribution to carbon dioxide radiative forcing?</p>

<p>As seen in the outgoing spectral radiance taken at the top of the atmosphere, the CO2 absorption peak is only half as high as the blackbody spectrum at the same wavelength. This is contradictory to the argument that the atmosphere is completely opaque in CO2 absorption bands. Does that mean that the thermal emission of CO2 accounts for most of the outgoing radiance at 15 µm? Is there a quick way to see that, and what implications does it have on the radiative forcing of CO2?</p>

"Why is reverse osmosis desalination the dominant method used and not heat-based methods?

I had a few questions:</p>

<p>1 - They mention that the brine that is released as a byproduct of the process is potentially harmful to marine life, so why not just dump it in the desert? Why do we need to release back in the ocean? I'm sure the effects of this won't be that big given that desalination is a tiny percentage of the world's water production. And if anything, given that global sea levels are rising, this might help things, right?</p>

<p>2 - The video states that the vast majority of desalination plants these days use reverse osmosis desalination and not heat-based methods. Why is that so? How is a process that requires energy better than using solar energy to evaporate the water? </p>

<p>Heat-based methods require energy from the sun, yes. But the way I imagine things, we can passively let in water from the ocean, put it under some glass panel that magnifies sun energy, and then let the water evaporate out through some piping to condense somewhere else. How is powering a pump through a membrane (that requires cleaning after) better?</p>

They can only exist in, for want of a better word, a digital fashion. They always form straight edges and if another atom is added, it's like another Lego brick has been added to the cube, it can only be fitted in exactly according to its grid like structure. The atom can only be in column one row six or column three row four and so on. Like pixels on the screen.</p>

<p>My understanding is that, in a crystal lattice, atoms cannot take positions in an analogue way, they cannot be positioned in a lattice a few micro metres one way or the other. </p>

<p>What I conclude from this reasoning is that there is only a finite number of shapes that any crystalline material can take because of the digital nature of the positioning of the atoms, as opposed to the analogue way you can sculpt plasticine.</p>

<p>Is this so?</p>

<p>If we could shrink down to the atomic level and look at a crystalline solid with the entire structure look like a Lego sculpture or a pixelated image? Or do the atomic patterns allow for some degree of analogue placement?</p>

<p>I have read there is such a thing as screw dislocations.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BXQ0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BXQ0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Does this say that although crystal atoms do generally have a pattern, that pattern is not rigid and inflexible?</p>

<p>When you pour liquid glass into a spherical mould and let it cool or sculpt something out of clay and fire it, do the crystal lattices that form bend to accommodate these curved edges? Or is the solid still cubic in pattern and it just seems to be analogue because it's too small to be seen? Do screw defects only occur when someone or something is applied pressure to the crystal or do they naturally form with curved lattices?</p>

<p>And yes I'm aware crystal grains have non-latticed atoms between them and sometimes there is a missing atom in the lattice. But that's not what I'm talking about here.</p>

<p>To put it as simply as I can, to crystals onlay ever exist as lego scuptures or can the grow like trees with curved bows?</p>

<p>Edit: when I say crystals I mean crystals like what we call in every day life like pyrite and quartz, materials like stone and ceramics.</p>

"Newton's & Kepler's age of the earth calculations - References?","<p>""Everybody knows"" that Newton and Kepler calculated the age of the earth. My problem is that, whilst ""everybody knows"" this, no-one gives a reference that I can read for myself. </p>

<p>If, for example, I want to read what Thomas Burnett believed, I download a copy of Telluris Theoria Sacra and I can read for myself that he accepted the reality of Noah's flood. The same is true of St Augustine's beliefs as there are several online translations of City of God Against the Pagans.</p>

<p>But Newton and Kepler? </p>

<p>Zilch. Sweet F.A. Absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>Even when a website  references a text, either I can't find the text, or there is no age-of-the-earth calculation in the text that I can find.</p>

<p>So, did either Newton or Kepler calculate the age of the earth, or is this just an urban myth? If it's true, does anyone have references that I can look at for myself. These will have to be secondary references (English translations) as I expect the actual primary reference to be in Latin, and sadly, I only read English.</p>

"Do dams reduce the flow of river downstream?","<p>There is a conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia, because the latter wants to build a dam on the Nile river.

<p>What do they mean by ""reduce its share of the river""? As far as I understand, the dam will create a reservoir, which will initially divert some water to be filled, but once that is done, the flow of the river should be the same. Is Egypt worried about this initial reduction, or do dams somehow reduce the flow of a river?</p>

<p>If so, what is the mechanism? I would guess that this is due to increased evaporation from the river, since the reservoir has a bigger surface than the usual river, but then again, it also collects more rain.</p>

As far as i understand, all carbon that is not found in the atmosphere or the oceans in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> or CO is stored either in the biomass (plants, animals, including humans, bacteria, mushrooms, etc.), or in fossils and fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gases), or in non-organic form as graphite and diamonds.  Is this correct?

1) The northward propagating waves emanating at the 850 hPa level from the MJO(BSISO) appear to be damped at the Himalayan foothills(30 N latitude). Following orographic interactions I presume the 850 hpA 's geopotential height appears to be raised. Is that an accurate statement i.e. in the mountains the 850 hPa monsoonal trough's geopotential height is higher(much higher) than at sea levels?</p>

<p>2) Then the planetary wave at the 500 hPa level then appears to be dipping down in the tropics and interacting with monsoonal troughs. How does a upper level trough ""propagate"" down ? Is this due to quasi geostropic theory?</p>

"What is the methodology to analyze future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?","<p>What is the accepted methodology to predict future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?</p>

<p>I have recently read a report about <strong>climatic extremes considering climate change</strong> (MICE, 2002). The report says that researchers fitted extreme value distributions (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generalized extreme value</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Pareto_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generalized Pareto</a>) to the intensity of predicted, future climatic actions, e.g. rain, snow, wind. Applying these models, events with a large <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_period"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">return period</a> are used to assess the impact of climate change. Additionally, there is a recent Nature article by O’Gorman which also deals with future extreme events, particularly snow.</p>

<p>Considering that the predictions (projections per scenarios) can be made only in probabilistic terms. I would like to know how these predictions are made, what methodology are they using? I mean the actual climatic data, not the extreme value (statistical) analysis of them. For extreme value analysis, annual or more frequent maxima can/could be used. It is quite dubious that climate models would predict monthly or annual maxima of rain/snow for a certain region, up to the end of this century (or are climate models so sophisticated?).
Someone told me that on this site (<a href=""http://esgf-data.dkrz.de/esgf-web-fe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earth System Grid Federation</a>) there is an example of daily predicted snow data (this can be downloaded).</p>

<p>So, my main question is <strong>how this data, these predictions, are produced. What are the underlying assumptions of the models?</strong> Can these 100-year long simulations be used to predict extreme events within a 100 to 1000 year return period (these are common in engineering practice).</p>

<p>As far as I know, the climate models contain 'accurate' models (where the phenomenon is described by differential equations) and 'approximate' models (where empirical models are used). I guess the actual amount of precipitation for a given region belongs to the latter; in this case how uncertain are these models? (Surely the 'accurate' models have large uncertainty as well, but perhaps less).</p>

<hr>

<p>I have an engineering background and I am interested in the effect of extreme climatic events on the reliability of structures; especially considering climate change. In order to study this, it would be great to know how reliable are the climate predictions regarding extreme events. If the probability distribution (or more complex probabilistic model of the actions) is given, the reliability of a structure (system) can be directly calculated. However, I am quite suspicious about the extremes predicted by the climate models.</p>

<p>It is quite hard to navigate through the thousand pages reports and find the probably one page long section which would answer my question. I would highly appreciate if someone could explain the main aspects of methodology, basic assumptions or point me to specific references, any help regarding the original question is welcomed.</p>

<p>I have a very rudimentary understanding of how weather works, but the engineer in me says in theory this should be possible.  But in reality a lot of small details glare out at me as possible show stoppers.  Aerodynamics does not scale, because of the constant size of air molecules at all scales.

<p>$$ u_{bt} = \frac{1}{d}\int_{-d}^{0}u(z)~dz$$</p>

<p>However, supposing the current to be geostrophic, the following expression can be found for the barotropic component:</p>

"Megathrust earthquakes on subduction zones","<p>I am a beginner in geology and earthquake studies, and learning about subduction zones recently.</p>

<p>Question is: do large earthquakes (sometimes referred to as megathrust quakes) occur on any point in the Subduction zone? For example, the Indo-Australian plate subducts underneath the Burma microplate, and the Sunda plate. So does the megathrust quake occur anywhere along this zone or is it limited to certain areas within the subduction zone?</p>

<p>Another related one is what is the different b/w earth quake and rupture process that happens after an earth quake. Example: in some articles about the 2004 Northern-Sumatra quake, I read that ""the rupture continued northward for nearly 1000 km"".</p>

"Relationship between natural disaster and global warming, in the media","<p>Sorry in advance if this is too broad a question. Feel free to let me know if it is off-topic.</p>

<p>I don't know more than the next person around about climate change, but I am really not a climato-skeptic myself. Yet, I feel uneasy about the way the media reports about the relationship between natural disaster and climate change, and I am looking for an unbiased assessment of these reports.</p>

<p>At least in what some would describe as “mainstream” media, my impression is that the following pattern emerges:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a natural disaster or nasty weather seems ""intuitively"" relatable to global warming (e.g., hurricanes, floods, etc., which a lay person like myself could believe would become more common with global warming), journalists go out of their way to find an expert who will tell them ""yes, this is going to be more likely to happen as the planet warms up"" and then headline things like ""Flooding in Paris Maybe Due To Climate Change"", to only cite the latest ( <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20180127140626-flooding-in-paris-maybe-due-to-climate-change/?ftag=CNM15cf32c"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20180127140626-flooding-in-paris-maybe-due-to-climate-change/?ftag=CNM15cf32c</a>).</li>
<li>On the other hand, when a natural disaster or nasty weather seems to ""intuitively"" contradict global warming (e.g., snowstorms, cold-wave, etc., which a lay person like myself has a harder time understanding how the phenomenon would become more common with global warming), journalists go out of their way to find an expert who will tell them ""this really is consistent with global warming and does not debunk the predictions of climate models at all"" and then headline things like ""Why the winter cold snap doesn’t disprove climate change” to only cite the latest (this is the title under which an article once appeared on CBS, before the title seem to have changed to <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adam-sobel-president-trump-global-warming-tweet-climate-change/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adam-sobel-president-trump-global-warming-tweet-climate-change/</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not interested in these two examples <em>per se</em>. In particular, I am not claiming these specific reports are biased (or unbiased for that matter, I am simply not qualified to make that call).</p>

<p>Rather, my question is: </p>

<ul>
<li>On average, is the media doing a fair and balanced job as an educator of under-informed people (like myself) on that topic?</li>
<li>Are they providing an even and science-based account of the relationship between natural disaster and global warming, honestly explaining how global warming is a complex phenomenon which may have surprisingly different --- and sometimes maybe “counter-intuitive” for lay people --- impacts here and there (including cooling and increased likelihood of sever weather in some areas)? </li>
<li>Or are they inflating reports “in favor of” action against climate change (e.g., reports that natural disasters will be more frequent with climate change, and that some “counter-intuitive” event do not disprove climate change), while maybe minimizing other reports of situations in which climate change could impact some areas in ways that some would view as “positive”?</li>
<li>Following useful comments: if ""averaging"" makes the question too hard to answer, which media does a good job, and which doesn't? </li>
<li>Any empirical work done on that question? Did anyone try to text-mine information websites and assess biases (compared to the best scientific evidence) in the media’s presentation of the relationship between natural disaster and global warming?</li>

<p>-""Worms"" (curved lines) tunnelled through a block of material that used to be rectangular. (C,D,F,J,H)</p>

<p>-faintly-circled letters represent ""cracks"" (discontinuities such as faults, I guess) (A,B,E,G,I)</p>

<p>-D is ""broken"" by B. (hard to tell in picture)</p>

<p>-Although there are ten letters, only 8 of them can be placed for certain. But we have to place the letters in order, say the two letters we cannot place for certain, and show all the possible locations where the other letters may be placed.</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>

<p>I looked at the cracks first. </p>

<p>E crack goes through A crack.</p>

<p>B crack goes through A crack.</p>

<p>B crack goes through I crack.</p>

<p>B crack goes through G crack.</p>

<p>I crack goes through G crack.</p>

<p>G crack goes through A crack.</p>

<p>Using principle of cross-cutting relationships, order from oldest to newest here is A, G, I, ((E,B) or (B,E))</p>

<p>Then I looked at the worms to the earthquakes.</p>

<p>A --> F goes through A, but J is broken by A.</p>

<p>B --> breaks C, H, F, J, and D</p>

<p>E --> C goes through E, but J, D, F, and H are older.</p>

<p>G --> C goes through G, but D is broken by G</p>

<p>I --> F goes through I, but H is broken by I.</p>

<p>Since B breaks all of the ""worms"" but E only breaks through four of the five ""worms,"" we can place the cracks as, from oldest to youngest</p>

<p>A, G, I, E, B</p>

<p>Then I started to place the ""worms"" between the cracks using principle of cross-cutting relationships. I got in the end (oldest to youngest):</p>

<p>J, A, G, I, F, E, C, B - D and H cannot be placed for certain.</p>

"Why is the Earth's shadow blue?","<p>After every sunset, once the sun is gone, I always enjoy seen the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus"" rel=""noreferrer"">belt of venus</a> rising in the other side, followed by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_shadow"" rel=""noreferrer"">Earth's shadow</a>.</p>

<p>This is a picture I took (you will find better ones online). The Pinkish-purple band on top is the Belt of Venus, and the blue band on the bottom is the Earth's shadow.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ul674.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ul674.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>While contemplating these beauties, I've had hard time understanding why we see the colors we do. To my eyes, the belt of Venus looks purple, which didn't makes sense to me, as the very short wavelength of purple light should have been scattered long before arriving back there. Then all made sense when I realized that if you mix blue and red light you get purple. So the color comes from the blue mixed with the red light backscattered by the high atmosphere that is still illuminated by the Sun.</p>

<p>However, I can't still figure out <strong>why the Earth's shadow looks blue</strong>, and I haven't been able to find an answer (here some links about the Earth's shadow but without an explanation of the color: <a href=""http://www.meniero.it/articoli/meteo/en/Earth%20Shadow.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/earths-shadow-07292014/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_shadow"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a>).</p>

<p>We know the sky is blue and the sunset red to due the <a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">preferential scattering of blue light</a> by the air. But: <strong>How can the air in the Earth's shadow scatter blue light if it doesn't get any direct illumination, and any indirect illumination getting back there should be VERY depleted in blue (i.e. mostly red light)?</strong></p>

<p>I thought the fact that the belt of Venus scatters red instead of blue as the rest of the atmosphere, is precisely because back there there is no more blue light left, so the weaker scattering of red light becomes noticeable (please let me know if I'm wrong there).</p>

<p><strong>Or is the air actually emitting blue light in some sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"" rel=""noreferrer"">fluorescence</a>/glowing?</strong> </p>

  <p>The level and effects of CO2 emissions are currently believed to be broadly the same regardless of altitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then there are numerous references to radiative forcing, which is supposedly almost doubling the effects of the emissions (at this point only co2, or also NOx and others?). These are never explained (it says ""see below"" once, but there follows no explanation below.</p>

<p>The article on radiative forcing says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically, radiative forcing is quantified at the tropopause in units of watts per square meter of the Earth's surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However this does not seem to explain why quantifying it ""at the tropopause"" makes sense, or what that means, since the measure given is measured on the surface. Does this imply that emissions below / above the tropopause are not considered contributing to radiative forcing? (I presume they are.)</p>

<p>Also, how come that emissions at greater heights force more? After all, at lower heights the same amount can cover a greater surface area at the same thickness / density. Maybe, the change in wavelength of incoming radiation is greater since the traveled distance is greater, and thus more is absorbed?</p>

<p>Lastly, does CO2 not ascend after being emitted at surface level, such that it will enter the stratosphere just as well as if it is emitted there? Or are there further factors partially mitigating this?</p>

<p>You can see I have too many questions, and find the Wikipedia articles very unrevealing / lacking.</p>

"How much water does a wave transport into a sea cave?","<p>How much water is transported (volume) as a wave travels into a sea cave?</p>

<p>How do I calculate this? This is a real-world problem and if there is any other information needed for this problem I will happily collect it.</p>

<p>This isn't a homework problem. This is a real cave and I assumed water is transported because it does pile up in the back of the cave until the wave is reflected and exits the cave in the opposite direction. Just as on beaches where waves push water up on to the beach and gravity pulls the water back to ocean creating the nearshore current. I understand that deep water waves have an almost circular orbit but due to Stokes drift a particle will be slightly displaced in the direction the swell is moving. In this cave we can assume the wave is well with in the shallow water wave criteria and almost at the critical depth in which the wave deformation is extreme and wave energy is about to be converted into turbulent kinetic energy as the wave breaks. The orbit therefore would be linear, as the wave moves in and out. The net change would be 0 m$^3$, but how much water flows in and then flows back out of the cave?</p>

"How exactly is the ""global average temperature"" calculated and how reasonable is this method?","<p>During the recent (2015) Paris climate negotiations there was a lot of talk in the media about ""limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius"".
I keep wondering about what this value of 2 degrees really means, and what can we read from this value.  It is said to refer to some sort of global average temperature. How is this average calculated, how meaningful can it be?</p>

<p>Temperature is what physicists call an intensive quantity, as opposed to extensive quantities which are additive.  Thus there is no physically natural way to define an <em>""average temperature""</em>.  Any averaging process will necessarily be arbitrary and ad hoc.  It can be done through space and through time, with various sampling frequencies in both, and with various averaging methods (arithmetic, geometric, various weighted versions, etc.).  It is indeed possible to construct pathological functions $f(x)$ the estimated average of which will be wildly different based on the averaging method, or even based on something as innocent looking as the sampling frequency.</p>

<p>Of course these difficulties don't mean that any average of an intensive quantity is meaningless.  It is completely reasonable to try to mathematically formalize the intuitive concept of warming.  But they do mean that it has to be done carefully.  It is also quite striking for those of us who are not climate scientist that the amount of warming we are talking about is on a scale (0-2 C) that is much smaller than the temperature variation we might experience during a time scale as short as a day or distance scales as short as a few hundred of kilometers.</p>

It seems to suggest that there is a significant difference between the two areas of Earth; one area being where Pangaea was located, and the other area being the rest of Earth.</p>

"Are the magnetic elements of meteorites that have struck Earth aligned with the magnetic field?","<p>I was just pondering this question; do meteorites containing significant magnetic metal elements displace paleomagnetism the same way that magnetic striping on the ocean floor occurs? When the meteorites pass through the atmosphere do they actually get hot enough to go beyond the curie point of any metal-bearing minerals that are within and then subsequently align with the magnetic field as they cool back down? </p>

<p>If so; I assume that would that be indicative of the Earth having an inner liquid core producing a magnetic field or could something else be the contributing factor to the alignment?</p>

"Wobbly Tire Theory -- Is there an existing theory that fits the following description?","<p>I am not an earth scientist but for many years I have wondered about the following. I am curious if this has already been explored by scientists? If so, what is the theory formally called? and what is the consensus of the scientific community about such a theory?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong> When you have new tires put on your car the mechanic will put the tire on a machine to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_balance"" rel=""noreferrer"">check the balance</a> and then add small lead or zinc weights on the rim to correct any wobble. Even though the weights are tiny by comparison they play a critical role in effective lifespan of the tires. </p>

<p>For the past couple hundred years humans have been moving ""tiny"" amounts of weight around the surface of the earth. We add weights when we build <a href=""http://www.newgeography.com/content/002808-world-urban-areas-population-and-density-a-2012-update"" rel=""noreferrer"">large cities</a>, or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_dams_in_the_world"" rel=""noreferrer"">dam rivers</a>. We take away weights when we <a href=""http://webecoist.momtastic.com/2009/09/10/massive-man-made-and-natural-holes/"" rel=""noreferrer"">excavate</a> and <a href=""http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/changes/anthropogenic/subside/"" rel=""noreferrer"">overdrafting</a>. </p>

<p>There also of course are <strong>natural events</strong> that move ""tiny"" surface weights around, such as <a href=""https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/quickfacts.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">glacier movement</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31848255"" rel=""noreferrer"">island formation</a>, <a href=""http://geology.about.com/library/bl/blbigcalderas.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">caldera eruptions</a>, and <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11489673/Largest-ever-meteorite-crater-found-in-Australian-outback.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">meteor strikes</a>. This last of course also imparts a vector of kinetic energy change due to impact force.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>THEORY:</strong> I call this personal idea the ""Wobbly Tire Theory"" on the presumption that Earth has for millennia been dealing with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_wobble"" rel=""noreferrer"">axis wobble</a> but has usually had time to adjust/stabilize between significant changes. However, in the past 200 years or so we have been making a lot of man-made changes in these weights in a timespan that is a geologic blink-of-an-eye. </p>

<p>I speculate that these rapid changes may be affecting the earths rotation in subtle ways. For example, I wonder could such changes affect the core's rotation vector in any way?</p>

<p><strong>So back to my original Question</strong>: Does this theory (including <strong>OR</strong> excluding the last about man-made effects) already exist among geophysicists and others? What name(s) does it go by? And what details, if any, are there on the scientific consensus of this concept?</p>

"St. Elmo's Fire not dangerous?","<p>I know that St. Elmo's Fire is a form of plasma that occurs during thunderstorms that is similar to lightning because it is formed by a difference in charges.</p>

<p>But why isn't it dangerous if St. Elmo's Fire is around you?</p>

<p>For one, the fact that there is a charge difference usually means an electric shock, whether that is a tiny bit of static electricity from touching metal or a lightning strike. Yet St. Elmo's Fire is caused by a charge difference but doesn't give you an electric shock.</p>

<p>Also if there is a charge difference around you, lightning is more likely to strike you, even if you are as low as you can be. This can lead to heart problems such as tachycardia, fibrillation, or asystole. It can also cause uncontrollable muscle movements which itself can be dangerous because if your muscles are out of control you can end up anywhere. Muscles being out of control can also mean things like vomiting, lots of mechanical digestion, high blood pressure and more from involuntary muscles being out of control. In any case it is dangerous to have voluntary or involuntary muscles out of control. It can also cause nervous system problems, in particular excitation toxicity from positive charges continously reaching neurons until they don't send a signal. </p>

<p>So with all the health problems that can result and the difference in charges itself without an electric shock, why is St. Elmo's Fire not dangerous?</p>

<h3>The assumptions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Such an airship exists and there is a person aboard, with an oxygen mask.</li>
<li>The person is thermally insulated to keep the heat inside.</li>
<li>The jet streams are at an altitude around 9–12 km (30,000–39,000 ft) .</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can a kite like the one in the picture be built to hold a person?</li>
<li>Does the human body require pressurization as well as oxygen and insulation? <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42436/what-is-the-maximum-altitude-where-humans-can-survive"">ANSWER</a> </li>
<li>Is it possible using the jet stream systems to go around the world?</li>
<li>Can the kite fly at speeds around 80-150 km/h related to the ground?</li>
<li>Can it sustain a free fall from its cruising altitude around 9–12 km so that the pilot can land maybe using a parachute?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible Solutions:</h3>

<p><strong>Launch</strong> Considering the altitude is up around 9–12 km then air would be thinner the size of it will have to be much larger to compensate. Use a cable and boat to lift the <em>UltraKite</em> into the Jet Stream. At preferred altitude cable then can be mechanically released from connected drag section of the kite. A drone or balloons could replace boat and then dropped. Maybe the person could ride in the drag section.</p>

<p><strong>Long Term Altitude with Ultralights Gliders on Record.</strong></p>

<p>The current 15460-meter glider height record was made with pressurized suits. But it is only 500 meters higher than Harris' previous record from 1986, which was done with just an oxygen mask. – Martin Argerami in a comment in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/24544/turbulent-jet-streams-on-ultralights?noredirect=1#comment62883_24544"">Turbulent Jet Streams on Ultralights</a></p>

<p><strong>As commented by @Jan Hudec</strong>: This is supposed to be a kite, but instead of being fixed to the ground as normal kite, it would have just a cabin with a braking parachute flying below the jet stream and the kite flying in the jet stream, so the whole thing would move at some speed between the slow speed of the wind at low altitude and the high speed of the jet stream.</p>

On one hand, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Low obliquity brings cool summers to both hemispheres, which favors ice buildup in the north and intensified circumpolar current in the south.  The intensification of the circumpolar current reduces upwelling of $\ce{CO2}$-rich water.  The reduction in atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ cools the planet..."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""high obliquity results in warmer summers in both hemispheres.  This begins to melt the continental ice sheets in the north, whereas in the south it intensifies circumpolar currents and winds, pumping $\ce{CO2}$-rich water to the surface and warming.""</p>

<p>How can ""intensified"" ACC both increase and decrease upwelling?

"Modeling swirling storms","<p>I'm looking to demonstrate the rotational behaviour of swirling storms with a numerical simulation. So far it includes pressure-gradient, Coriolis acceleration, frictional forces and the acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p>In a non-inertial frame of reference (surface of the Earth), $(O', \vec{x'}, \vec{y'}, \vec{z'})$, $\vec{x'}$ points south, $\vec{y'}$ points eastward and $\vec{z'}$ upward. I've found that the acceleration of air masses is expressed as:</p>

<p>$\ddot{x'}=-\cfrac{1}{\rho}\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial x'} - \nu \dot{x'} + 2\omega\sin(\lambda)\dot{y'}$</p>

<p>$\ddot{y'}=- \cfrac{1}{\rho}\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial y'} - \nu \dot{y'} -2\omega(\sin(\lambda)\dot{x'} + \cos(\lambda)\dot{z'})$</p>

<p>$\ddot{z'}=- g - \cfrac{1}{\rho}\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z'} - \nu \dot{z'} + 2\omega\cos(\lambda)\dot{y'}$</p>

<p>where the last terms are the deflections due to the Coriolis effect, the middle ones friction forces and the first ones pressure-gradient forces. $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($g=9.8 \ m.s^{-2}$).</p>

<p>I would work in 2 dimensions since my initial conditions (pressure maps) are given for a specific altitude. But then I would ignore some terms of the Coriolis and gravity, and many other effects I bet. I can go for a 3d description of the phenomenon, but it might be too difficult to deal with a collection of pressure maps at different altitudes.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the set of equations physically correct to model accurately the spiral-ish rotation of hurricanes? If not, what are the other forces that would be worth adding?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm doing a numerical simulation, and I want to test it with pressure maps. The first thing I've done was removing the terms that act in the $\vec{z'}$ direction since my initial conditions (pressure maps) are given for a specific altitude. Is this approximation still correct to achieve my goal?</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to question 2, if the model should rather be described in a 3 dimensional coordinate system, it might be too difficult to deal with a collection of pressure maps at different altitudes, is it?</p></li>

"What is the temperature of the flowing water in icy river?","<h3>Boundaries of the question:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The question is about rivers where water flows in cold area of the earth. Whether it's because of the winter or it's simply cold all year long. Usually, the top layer of the river freeze and water underneath continue to flow freely.</li>
<li>The question is about the temperature of the liquid water only. So, the temperature of the solid water is irrelevant to the question.</li>
<li>This question is only about fresh water rivers only. So salty rivers are not part of the question.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The question itself:</h3>

<p>What is the temperature of the flowing water in icy river?<br>
More precisely, does the temperature of the water drop below 0 °C?<br>
If it does, is this common?
If it doesn't, does it get close to it at all?</p>

<h3>Attempted research to find the answer :</h3>

<p>I had in mind that the current allowed the water to stay liquid, but that might be wrong because there is no proof to it.
However, <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/4361/7668"">this answer</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For flowing water to freeze, the temperature would have to be
  exceptionally cold.</p>

<p>Which seems to agree that current <a href=""http://sciencequestionswithsurprisinganswers.org/2013/12/09/can-water-stay-liquid-below-zero-degrees-celsius/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can lower the freezing point</a>. </p>

<p>I found a great document about the temperature of the water within lake, but didn't find any reliable answer for rivers.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
I have come to believe that temperatures don't typically fall below 0 °C, based upon aggregating the following information...   </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/4359/7668"">Rivers freeze completely once the heat lost exceeds the rate of water
replacement</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.greatlandofalaska.com/reference/faq.html#freezesolid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Most lakes and rivers don't freeze solid because water,
ice, and snow are good insulators and poor conductors of heat. The
portions of a lake or river that is exposed to the cold winter air
freezes, and this ice insulates the water below from
further rapid freezing.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Earth is warming the water from below. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Using this, we can probably conclude that water won't cool down enough during it's journey down the river. Thus, the water would need to be already colder at the start of the journey. We know that the start is a lake with calm water. So, it's unlikely to happen because the lake would freeze completely and stop flowing out into the river. </p>

"Convert air vapor pressure to relative humidity","<p>Is it possible to convert Air vapor pressure ($N/m^2$) to relative humidity (%) given a known air temperature? </p>

I live near a river and it seems that it takes over a week of dry weather before there's any noticeable drop in its level. How does it not simply run out of water? 
Is it simply that it takes very a long time for the water at its source and the sources of all its tributaries to reach the point I'm observing from?</p>

<p>It seems there's a constant supply of water when I would have expected the network of rivers to start draining, and the drying up starting from the source the moment the rain stopped.</p>

"Why in different places seems directions are changed?","<p>I'm living at place <strong>A</strong> I traveled to <strong>B</strong> and I seen like sun isn't set as in place <strong>A</strong>. Like directions are changed. Where <strong>east</strong> is in place <strong>B</strong> is <strong>north</strong> of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>south</strong> of <strong>A</strong> is   <strong>west</strong> of <strong>B</strong>. Because of sun wasn't set in <strong>B</strong> as usually as set in place <strong>A</strong>. Sun rises in north at place <strong>B</strong> and sets in south. I really confused with this phenomenon of nature. Is it mean we consider direction which region we living in? Is it all because of <i>longitude</i> and <i>latitude</i>? Why it'd be like this? May it because if sun travel by specific longitude and latitude and so we would confused in situation like this even sun is stable planet and just earth rotate?</p>

"How long does a magnetic pole reversal take to complete?","<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Geomagnetic pole reversal</a> is a ""regular"" phenomenon on Earth</strong>. Although the interval pattern has been irregular at times (sometimes with millions of years of difference between change intervals), Earth has settled in the last 20 million years into a pattern of a pole reversal about every 200,000 - 300,000 years (source: <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA</a>). Based on this pattern and the fact that the most recent pole-switch occurred ~<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">780,000 years ago</a>, <strong>the Earth is ""overdue"" for a pole switch</strong>.</p>

<p>My question: <strong>How quickly does a pole switch occur?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it instantaneous? Does it take years? Millennia?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the current movement of the pole part of a drawn-out switch, or is it just ""normal"" pole movement? Again, from <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The magnetic north pole has been creeping northward – by more than 600 miles (1,100 km) – since the early 19th century, when explorers first located it precisely. It is moving faster now, actually, as scientists estimate the pole is migrating northward about 40 miles per year, as opposed to about 10 miles per year in the early 20th century.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>From some previous research, it seems like it doesn't always make a ""clean"" switch either, with multiple poles appearing globally -- would this multi-pole extravaganza increase the switching time, or is it also normal?</p></li>

"What field studies have developed or supported the Penman-Monteith equations for estimating evapotranspiration?","<p>I'm trying to understand transpiration estimation methods. The FAO recommends a standard Penman-Monteith methodology for modeling evapotranspiration based on meteorological and vegetation parameters (ie. wind speed, leaf area index). Many eco-hydrology models make use of the Penman-Monteith equations, some with minor modifications.</p>

<p>I understand the Penman-Monteith equations, and modification thereof, are simplifications of complex processes. It would be impractical to measure actual transpiration in all conditions where that information is useful, so we model it instead. That said, field observations in the development or support of models is valuable for verifying knowledge gained through models.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>what field studies have developed or supported Penman-Monteith equations (or modified versions of it)?</strong> In a sense there is <em>indirect</em> verification of the equations through field measurement verification of results from models that implement the Penman-Monteith equations. Are there any direct field measurements of (evapo-)transpiration that support (or even helped develop) the Penman-Monteith equations, to demonstrate the equations' validity in real world conditions?</p>

"Phase conversion of snow and ice due to irradiation versus melting","<p>A few years ago <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/51/what-are-the-impacts-of-sublimation-on-an-annual-mountain-snowpack"">another question touched on the relative rates of sublimation versus melting</a> in terms of snow and snow pack disappearance.</p>

<p>What was unusual about the answer is the huge range of variability in the results from different studies. One study claiming only 2% of ablation was due to sublimation and another claiming almost all of it was. I vaguely remember an extensive New Zealand study (not shown in the answer) that had a result showing about half of ablation is due to irradiation (sublimation).</p>

<p>Has this subject been revisited by more thorough-going studies that answer the question definitively?</p>

<p>In my own view, it would seem that ""backyard"" experiments could be done on snow drifts to answer this question. In my mind there should be no one single numeric answer but rather a table which relates several factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>the underlying ground material and strata (sandy soil, rock, asphalt, etc)</li>
<li>the air temperature</li>
<li>the latitude and time (= inclination to the sun)</li>
<li>surface area exposed to sun</li>
<li>surface area exposed to ground</li>
<li>volume of frozen accumulation</li>
<li>type of frozen accumulation (dry snow, wet snow, ice)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these factors it should be possible using the principles of thermodynamics and physical experiments to create tables (or equations) that define ablation in terms of these seven variables.</p>

"A balloon falling from space?","<p>How long would it take for a store bought rubber balloon filled in space with air to fall from space just outside the atmosphere and touch ground? Would it Pop?   </p>

<p>Added after comments: Ideally you would like to have a balloon filled with 14 PSI before it was dropped so that way it maintains its shape all the way down to the ground. But being a normal party balloon has its problems. It would only take one PSI of ambient air to fill a party balloon in space and any more than that it would pop.
I didn't take in consideration on how temperature would affect the rubber. On the sunny side it would be well above the melting point of the rubber. On the freezing shadow side of the Earth side the rubber would freeze becoming brittle and break.</p>

<p>Temperature outside would the pressure of falling through the atmosphere pop the balloon?</p>

"How to use Maximum Sustainable Yield concept with given a given population, growth rate and carrying capacity?","<p>For my class, I was given a hypothetical situation that uses the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield to see how much fish I should harvest.

<p>Then with these given values, I was supposed to use this information to calculate for next year's population which I easily did with the logistic growth formula. I got a population of 368 (which is obviously rounded to a whole number). From what I know, with this initial population of 368 that I calculated, it would a bit over the one-half capacity but not over the carrying capacity of the environment that was given to me.</p>

<p>At this point, I don't know how to apply the Maximum Sustainable Yield concept here. I am not sure on how much I should harvest this year if the current fish population is 368. I don't want to harvest all 368 fish because that would mean that I wiped out the entire population for this year, correct?

<p>Ideally this data would cover <strong>a recent year with no gaps greater than a few days</strong>, and would come as a spreadsheet with time-stamps and <strong>precipitation measurements on the hour</strong> side-by-side. I'm not picky and will format as needed, but I haven't found anything close to this yet. Also, public-domain/open-data is much preferred (we all like free things right?) but is not a limiting factor in my search.</p>

"How long would it take for Mars to cool after asteroid impact?","<p>As someone interested in terraforming, the main obstacle to colonizing Mars is the lack of a magnetosphere and Atmosphere. To create a magnetosphere of sufficient magnitude the Martian core must be reignited.

Doing so would reignite the core resulting in increased volcanic activity, the formation of a thick and stable atmosphere, etc.</p>

<p>It seems to be the perfect solution despite the fact that doing so would be a long term investment.

What are the factor that play a role in this configuration? </p>

<p>My guess is radiation from the building and the wind (the frost free part being more protected from the wind by the building) but then I wonder : Will there still be these two zones after a night without any wind? (Question 2)</p>

<p>The left house is heated, the middle one isn't but it's inhabited, the shed is closed but not insulated and without heating source inside.
There isn't any other surrounding structures that could create shade. </p>

<p>The open side of the garden is facing south. </p>

<p>I observed the frost after sunrise, but before the sun rays were reaching the garden.  </p>

"Why does dew accumlate on only one side of my car?","<p>Many days I walk out to my car to go to work and notice my windows are fogged up, I believe due to dew (haha homophones). When I am at my mother's house(O'Fallon, MO), all Windows get fogged up. When I am at my father's house (Saint Charles, MO), only one side of the car is fogged up.</p>

<p>This is kind of a two-part question. 1) How does dew accumulate? 2) Why would it only accumulate on one side of my car?</p>

<p>I suspect it has to do with the fact the side that does not fog up faces a tree. This is very curious to me. Since I am not sure what else is needed to answer my question, I will update as comments come in.</p>

"How to compare earthquake magnitudes","<p>On the <a href=""https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=Richter%20scale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USGS website</a>, it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number
  increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured
  amplitude;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However my book says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale is not linear. This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But based upon the USGS information, an increase in 2 magnitude would be 10 x 10 = 100 stronger.</p>

<p>Now which one is correct?</p>

"Color of ocean waters and Ekman pumping - what is the connection?","<p>Is there a connection between the colors of oceanic waters near the coast and Ekman pumping? Along the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal where I live, occasionally during the monsoon, the colors of the waters become aquamarine, only to become sky blue in color a few hours later as the sea breeze sets in. 
Can this be explained by coastal upwelling?  If this is due to Ekman pumping where does EP take place? Over equatorial waters and is then pushed north due to a coastal current? 
The phenomenon has been observed during both the Indian monsoons- the south west monsoon as well as the north east monsoon i.e. that the seasonal shift in wind direction does not impact the appearance of the aquamarine color. </p>

<p>The width of the patch is between 200-300 meters from the coast and it is oriented parallel to the coast. Closer to the coast the color is dark greenish brown and as you go further into the open sea it is aquamarine green. There are occasional dark blue ""patches""(dark blue bands) which I am presuming is phytoplankton. </p>

<p>Few more personal observations. It appears that the aquamarine color usually manifests itself during the mornings (when there is no breeze whatsoever). The sea presents extremely gentle waves when the aquamarine color is visible. Does that mean that the origin of the aquamarine color is ""non - local"" ? </p>

"What, if any, paleoclimate data can be derived from igneous rocks?","<p>Paleoclimate data often derives from sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic rocks can also contribute to paleoclimate information in a wide variety of ways.</p>

<p>What about igneous rocks? I guess that this can question be divided into two, about intrusive and extrusive rocks.</p>

<p>Extrusive rocks will have direct contact with the climate. They may exchange geochemical signals with the atmosphere or water they've erupted to. The cooling rate may be dependent on ambient temperature. Lava flows may fossilise the soil.</p>

<p>Intrusive rocks may be harder to interpret in that manner, if at all. The time resolution will obviously not be as good as dating individual beds from the lake floor, but I still think something can be gained from it. Maybe some igneous rocks can form only after a special sedimentary rock (derived from a specific climate) has been buried and remelted? What about isotopes? Sedimentay systems often fractionate various isotopic systems. Can this variability be later traced in igneous rocks?</p>

After initial engineering tests, the “StratoCruiser” would spray a fine mist of materials such as <strong>sulfur dioxide, alumina, or calcium carbonate</strong> into the stratosphere. The sensors would then measure the reflectivity of the particles, the degree to which they disperse or coalesce, and the way they interact with other compounds in the atmosphere.</p>

Would the alumina and calcium carbonate also seed water droplet formation as their reflective mechanism, or would only the particles themselves be reflective?</p>

"Was the filling of the Three Gorges Dam's impact on the Earth's rotation rate detectable?","<p>I'm a big fan of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsauce"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vsauce</a> and the video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJhgZBn-LHg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How Earth Moves</a> is just one example of science related to the Earth available there (there's plenty more).</p>

<p>But the statement in <a href=""https://youtu.be/YMTLkDrcr28?t=99"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video starting at <code>01:39</code></a> strikes me as a little surprising. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know how a figure skater, spinning in place, can slow down their (rotational) speed by extending their arms out; by moving some of their body mass away from the middle of their body? Well the same thing can happen to Earth. </p>
  
  <p>The Three Gorges Dam did exactly what a figure skater does when they move their arms away from their center. It transferred <strong>thirty nine trillion kilograms of water one hundred and seventy five meters above sea level</strong>. </p>
  
  <p>NASA calculated that that massive amount of water moved, caused Earth’s rotation to slow down, so that <strong>every day</strong> of your life since that dam was finished, <strong>has been longer by 0.06 microseconds</strong>. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I calculated correctly, that would be a ""slip"" of about 1 centimeter per year at the equator.</p>

<p>There are many causes of change to the Earth's distribution of mass, it's moment of inertia, and therefore the length of a day. Tidal forces from the Moon can contribute substantially to changes in Earth's rotation as well, and there could be short term geological effects as well.</p>

<p>Is this <em>roughly 0.06 microsecond/day shift</em> well below the ""noise"" level, where in this case I'm using ""noise"" to refer to effects that are smaller than the error that can be modeled? So for example exchanges between sea ice and sea water can be measured and modeled to some level of accuracy, and the Moon's tidal effects <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/251700/83380"">can be measured and modeled</a> to great precision, so even if the Three Gorges Dam effect turns out to be small compared to those, it could still be detected as long as its effect is larger than the error that those effects can be accurately calculated. </p>

<p>What is a breadboard (retrieval) algorithm?  Google Search yields precious few results, mostly from ESA.  Another usage I found</p>

  <p>Originally, three <strong>breadboard algorithms</strong> were developed at the

  was  transferred  to  ESA  /  Bomem  for  the  creation  of  the  ESA  algorithms.  In  the  meantime,  the  original  look-up  table approach was replaced for the breadboard algorithms by the use of artificial neural networks, which significantly eases the interpolation  of  the  simulation  results  onto  the  actual  viewing geometry.</p>

<p>Wikipedia tells me that, in electronics, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">breadboard</a> is <em>a construction base for prototyping electronics</em>.  The details of the article do not appear relevant for the algorithm usage, but it makes me guess that the meaning of breadboard is related to prototyping.  However, from context, it is clear that the job ad or the ENVISAT paper has nothing to do with electronics.</p>

"How is geological time divided into units?","<p>Earth's history is divided into eons, which are divided into eras, which are divided into periods etc. Consecutive time units differ in their geology and/or fossil species. But what events are the basis for dividing time into discrete bands?</p>

<p>Roughly speaking (forgive the approximation), the Hadean is the time before life, the Archean is the subsequent time before eukaryotes, the Proterozoic is the subsequent time before complex multicellular animals, and the Phanerozoic is the time since then. Yes, I know that the actual definitions are in terms of either what can be seen in the rocks or a certain number of Mya; and yes, I know the Ediacaran biota technically lived in the late Proterozoic; but, if I've understood correctly, the reason we separate these four parts of Earth's history is because of such distinctions. We can similarly divide the Phanerozoic into three eras based on the P-T and K-Pg mass extinctions. (However, the other three of the Big Five extinction events define the start of new periods rather than eras.)</p>

<p>Is there a more thorough list than this of the qualitative events and processes in Earth's history that motivate the specific ways we've defined eons, eras and periods? I realise there may be some arbitrariness in it, e.g. the fact that some mass extinctions ""only"" start a new period instead of a new era. However, I'll be satisfied with a summary of the key moments on which these divisions are based.</p>

"How much worse is the typical subway air, compared to street-level air pollution, in a typical city?","<p>An excerpt from a section about the capital of Taiwan, in an article I wrote about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Taiwan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air pollution in Taiwan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Further more, in greater Taipei, the outdoor PM2.5 concentration in
  the air at ground-level up until the height of three-stories is around
  ten to twenty times higher than the concentration in the air at the
  height of four-story buildings and above. Levels of other hazardous
  suspended particles such as silicon and iron were equally found to be
  significantly lower when increasing altitude. Professor Chang-Fu Wu
  (吳章甫) of the same university attributed this to dust and traffic
  pollution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my question is, can this increasing pollution, when decreasing in altitude, be extrapolated to a negative (as compared to street-level) altitude as well, in a typical city? Intuitively, I would assume that parkings (don't forget about traffic tunnels) can be pretty bad, when thinking of sub-terrain places in a typical city, with regards to pollution? But what I am really interested in here, is finding out more about the increase in pollution in subways (underground transportation), as compared to the street-level.</p>

<p>Is this problem perhaps being mitigated partly by sucking in air from a high altitude? <strong>(this shouldn't be seen as the question, it's just a remark)</strong></p>

<p>P.S. <strong>(this is also not part of the question, so please don't close this question because I wrote a remark)</strong>: I think finding higher ground is actually one of the best ways to escape from pollution in cities. But of course many cities will not give this advice to its citizens ... it might be unpopular and sound bad.</p>

"Why is the elevation of the Iberian Peninsula so high?","<p>The Iberian peninsula lies more than 600 m above sea level, on average, far above similar geological regions in western Europe. Even tectonically undeformed areas in the inner basins present a topography and a sedimentary infill sometimes higher than 1000 m. Why?</p>

<p>The elevation of continents is generally thought to be the result of the isostatic equilibrium (Archimedes balance) of the crust floating on a fluid mantle (Pratt and Airy models, late XIX century). The thicker the crust (which is less dense than the mantle), the higher topography. The denser the crust, the lower the topography. </p>

<p>However, the crust of the Iberian Peninsula is about 30-33 km thick on average, similar to most of the western european platform, and nothing suggests that the Iberian crust has a lower density than other regions. Why then is the topography of Iberia higher than 600 m, in contrast with the near sea-level western Europe?</p>

<p>So, the underlying question is: why Iberia is 600m higher than the W European Platform, having its Moho (base of the crust) shallower?</p>

"How far upstream would severe sea level rise (1m) noticably affect a large river?","<p>The projection for sea level rise due to global warming seem to hover about 1m by 2100, let's use this figure. How far upstream would this noticably affect a large river, e.g. the Rhine?</p>

<p>I think it is obvious that the Delta would be changed severely, while it is nigh impossible to say accuratly how exactly (I assume). Upstream, I think the following effects com into play: Less hydraulic head means less flow velocity, more sedimentation and a higher water level in the river bed (the river needs more cross section to achieve the same volume flow with less head). Are these assumptions correct so far?</p>

<p>Now the main question is how far upstream we would notice these changes in river behavior: Only at 1m above new sea level, or 10m, or 100m? Is this stronger determined by linear distance along the river, or by height above (new) sea level? </p>

<p>I prefer the Rhine as an example because it's the closest large river. If someone has a good answer for another large river I'm happy too.</p>

<p>Now if I assumed that Earth's albedo was the same as it is today, what would have been the effective radiating temperature of the Earth at that time.</p>

<p>My solution:
T_e = S/4*(1 - A)</p>

<p>I know that Earth's current albedo is A = 0.3.</p>

<p>Hence,</p>

<p>T_e = S/4*(1 - 0.3)</p>

<p>T_e = ( (0.7)*(1370) ) / (4 (5.67*10^-8))  * (1-0.3) = 233K</p>

<p>233K &lt;- would have been Earth's effective radiating temperature</p>

<p>Now if one assumes the magnitude of the greenhouse effect was the same then (now it is 33k) Earth's temperature would be:</p>

<p>233K + 33K = 266K</p>

<p>Assuming the math is right between those two would there have been liquid water on Earth? If there would be, how does one resolve this paradox? that is, given that albedo was the same, what element of the climate system could explain this?</p>

"How does temperature impact the elevation distribution of orographic precipitation?","<p>Consider the case of two weather systems of different temperatures hitting the Andes Mountains from the west: After traveling a long distance over the Pacific ocean I would expect the air in both systems to be water saturated (i.e. Relative Humidity of 100%). However, the warmer system will be carrying more water and it will drop more water over the mountains (correct me if I got something wrong up to this point).</p>

<p>Now: <strong>Will the precipitation happen over the same elevation range?</strong> Or it will start to happen at lower/higher elevations?. <strong>Will the point of maximum precipitation stay the same?</strong> Or it will migrate upwards/downwards?</p>

<p>In case particular details are needed to answer this question, I'll describe now my main area of interest, that correspond to the Patagonian icefields, in the southern tip of South America between latitudes 46 to 51° South, roughly 500 km in the north-south direction. The area corresponds to the red box in the following world map:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAR2m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAR2m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The size of the area would put it in the the upper boundary of the mesoscale meteorology. However, topography gradients can vary quite a bit within the domain.</p>

<p>The following image show how the area looks from above, with a sat image on the left (where the ice extent is clear) and the topography on the right:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nd6EM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nd6EM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have averaged the above elevation model in the north-south direction to obtain the average topography profile that Westerlies will face when hitting the mountains from the West (predominant winds come from between W and NW direction). This is how it looks:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eOCsf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eOCsf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The red lines (40 km apart) indicate roughly the currently ice covered longitudinal band. To the west of it, liquid precipitation dominates and there is no permanent ice cover. To the east, there is very little precipitation (dry pampas) and therefore no ice cover either.</p>

"Science behind the groundhog day myth","<p>The myth goes that if a groundhog sees his shadow on Feb 2, six more weeks of winter are yet to come, but if he doesn't, spring is just around the corner.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is any science behind this myth, or perhaps an origin based on observations of actual weather patterns relating to the seasons.</p>

<p>Never mind the groundhog, I am thinking about sky conditions and the seasons.</p>

<p>Specifically, where I am in southern Ontario Canada, winter is usually at its coldest around the start of February. At this time of year we are often under an arctic high pressure ""dome""; skies are often clear. As the cold gives way to milder weather, we often end up under the jetstream, or at least it sweeps back and forth over us, delivering a lot of stormy, wintry weather, after which the jetstream at the boundary of the polar air mass eventually retreats north and spring arrives.</p>

<p>Is this an oversimplification? If not, could this sort of pattern be the origin of the myth: generally clear skies mean winter remains settled in, more unsettled weather means winter is about to give way to spring?</p>

"How to divide timeseries into normal periods in meteorology and climatology?","<p>When analyzing hydrological and climatological timeseries/observations it is a common practice to compare statistics made on normal periods. As WMO calls them: ""WMO Climatological Normals"".</p>

<p>These periods consist normally of 30 years of data. If you want to compare two normal periods with each other, let's say for example the periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010.</p>

<p>Now if we take averages for all the seasons in the period 1951-1980, the last month is December in this period. If we regard December, January, and February as a complete season/winter, it means that we have an incomplete winter at the end of the period 1951-1980. Now taking December to represent a whole winter, would be inaccurate. The monthly variations of a climatic parameter can vary greatly, and multiplying the December values by 3 wouldn't yield a result based on actual observations. Also making December the whole winter of 1980, would underestimate the real winter average. This would in turn affect the overall 30-year mean, by lowering it and giving a wrong picture of the actual seasonal mean in that normal period.</p>

<p>Same goes for the beginning of the period 1981-2010, here we have January and February as an incomplete winter.</p>

<p>Now in order to get complete seasons in the intersections between the normal periods, wouldn't it be best to split the periods as follows: 1951-1980.11.30 and 1980.12.01-1990.</p>

<p>Also it would be best to cut out December completely at the end of the period: 1980.12.01-1990.</p>

<p>So that it becomes: 1980.12.01-1990.11.30.</p>

<p>The same goes for the last normal period: 1951-1980.11.30.</p>

<p>Where we would cut out January and February of 1951 so that we get: 1951.03.01-1980.11.30.</p>

<p>In this way we make sure we have complete seasons in both normal periods.
So if we also do comparisons of monthly averages: JAN-FEB-MAR..., we would still split up the periods in the same manner, in order to use the exact same periods for exact comparison with the seasonal averages.</p>

<p>However when we have split up the periods as follows: 1951.03.01-1980.11.30 and 1980.12.01-1990.11.30. Is it still normal in academic papers to say that we are comparing the normal periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010, when there is actually a small overlap in the last?</p>

<p>If this is not the normal procedure, what is the way to get around this? What do researchers normally do in this case?</p>

<p>In addition cutting of seasons/months in this manner yields an unequal number of months/seasons. The analysis might have data from a higher number of the month February compared to January. So the statistics from February are more reliable. Also a disadvantage of cutting out actual observation data, yields a loss of valuable observation data, which lowers the reliability of the statistics.</p>

Can we get a time difference between these two cities. I raised this question because the shape of the Earth is oblate spheroid,i.e., bulges out at the equator and constricts at the poles. In 24 hours the Earth rotates once. But the circle at the equator traversed by the sun is not equal to the high latitudes because of the shape of the Earth. This difference in circle traversed by the sun makes a difference in time between the two latitudes. Am I wrong to put it that way? </p>

<p>To elaborate a little bit, one day is 24 hours and is the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun. We call it a solar day. One complete rotation around the equator gives big circle (longer circumference) and around the higher latitudes makes small circle (smaller circumference). So the time it takes to complete one complete circle around the equator is not equal to the time it takes in higher latitudes. Or are they equal?</p>

As a graduate student, I would report the average if I had at least 4 days in the month, which seemed reasonable to me at the time for some reason.  However, the number of available data points for a monthly average fluctuates so much, that the minimum number of members in the monthly average that I chose affected my temporal trendlines.  </p>

<p>What's the minimum number of days needed for satellite-derived maps of monthly averages?  I can't call 3 days of data a ""monthly average"" in good faith, but is 4 days enough?  For the purposes of this question, assume there is only one possible data retrieval per day per geo-location.</p>

"Does natural plant decomposition release more greenhouse gases than burning","<p>I understand that all plant matter releases CO<sub>2</sub> as it decomposes and also when it burns in, for example, a forest fire.

"Guidelines for locations of NTU markings on a turbidity tube","<p>One way to <em>estimate</em> the turbidity of water while in the field is to use a  turbidity tube. So far I've found two sources where I can get an idea of the locations of NTU markings along the tube.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(UW Extension, 2003). Several tables of slightly different conversions are currently in use. This table was chosen from among the alternatives because of the reliability of the source and because the values were more conservative than in other tables. </p>

<p>I've made a rough plot of both below, and they are significantly different. That's not too surprising, as there is difference in construction as well as difference in opinions and between sources.</p>

<p>Are there any further guidelines out there that I've missed? Any further advice before I make one and give it a try? Of course I'll include a centimeter scale so that it can be converted later, but sooner or later I'll need to settle down and choose a conversion.</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> I am most interested in the <em>higher turbidity</em> end of the scale, say above 50 NTU. This is not traditionally the turbidity tube's ""best end"", but it's where the two sources I've found diverge the most.</p>

"How to compare the oil production in barrel vs production in tons","<p>I hope this is the right SE site...I was unsure if to post here or on Physics, but I see there are quite many questions about oil here. So, my question is the following: I would like to compare the huge oil production of Texas, vs the minuscule (in comparison) oil production of a small region in Europe. I know it's silly, but some people are making this comparison and I want to show it's meaningless with actual numbers. Texas oil production is easy to find:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/oil-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/texas-monthly-oil-gas-production/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/oil-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/texas-monthly-oil-gas-production/</a></p>

<p>1 131 557 443 barrels for 2016: I'm a little bit surprised they can pin it down to the single barrel (I guess much more than a barrel is lost in spillage, contamination, etc.), but oh, well. </p>

<p>The European region I'm considering has a production of about 3.75 million tons of oil. So, how do I compare barrels (a unit of volume) to tons (a unit of mass)? For a rough number, I thought oil must be lighter than water, since it floats on it, so if I consider water density, I'll get an upper bound. Now, since an oil barrel seems to correspond to 159 liters <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)#Oil_barrel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Wikipedia</a>, I would get an upper bound of 
$$(1\ 131\ 557\ 443 * 159)/1000\ m^3 * 1 \ ton /m^3 = 179\ 917\ 633 \ tons $$</p>

<p>About 180 million tons of oil (thus the comparison is ridiculous, as I suspected). But oil density is less than water, and it's actually very dependent on the type of oil being extracted, so to get a lower bound I will consider a density of $790 \ kg/m^3$ which I think is fairly low for Texas oil (correct me if I'm wrong). So I get about 142 million tons of oil, and this is still nearly two orders of magnitude larger than 3.75 million tons of oil. Is this correct? Would it be possible to get sharper estimates, or is this the best one could hope to get, given all the uncertainties in this calculation?</p>

"Pigments from earth","<p>We're about to do lime wash on one of our heritage buildings. We decided to use ochre as pigment because it comes from earth. My boss says with any pigment that comes from earth, we don't need to worry about discoloration in lime mortar, which is high in pH value. But some of our guys are using laterite powder for brick repairs and I wonder if it is a good choice. Would it discolor in lime mortar? How would it react? Please, someone answer me!</p>

<p>Maybe I need to mention more info in my question. I'm from myanmar and we've got a lot of sunshine and a lot of rain too during moonsoon season. We're not doing new buildings, just repairing a historic building built around 1900. This building is basically abandoned for decades, and it's quite big. A lot of bricks need to be replaced, but in some areas we intend to use lime mortar with brick dust to imitate a brick rather than raking out and replacing with a new one. But we're not achieving the same color as the original brick but when we add laterite powder to lime mortar, color is satisfactory. Our only concern is that we don't want the repaired areas faded away after three or four years. </p>

"Is winter hotter at the Equator?","<p>I live in the Northern Emisphere.

"How does the existence of a Greenhouse Gas Effect (GHE) in the atmosphere affect the tropospheric lapse rate?","<p>I am restricting my consideration, for the moment, to just the troposphere. With regard to our understanding of the GHE do we predict that an increased GHE due to increasing CO2/Water/Methane will change the lapse rate postively or negatively? The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR), according to my old text books, is easily calculated from the formulae -g/c, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and c is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere. This is supposed to be a general formulae that can be applied to any planet with a solid surface and a gaseous atmosphere. So for earth is the formulae now -g/c + (GHE) or is it -g/c - (GHE)? The bracketed GHE term being specific to the atmosphere of a specific composition, e.g. including 400ppm CO2. 
The second part of the question then , after we have the correct sign, is how is the term (GHE) expected to vary as the CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) concentrations vary? </p>

<pre><code>$angle = round(atan2($u, $v) * 180 / pi());
if ($angle &lt; 0) {
    $angle = 360 + $angle;

u=-1 v=1 315° NW
u=1 v=-1 135° SE

u=-1 v=1 135° SE
u=1 v=-1 315° NW
u=-1 v=-1 45° NE

<p>Upon extracting that file using the <a href=""http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/filter_gfs_0p25.pl?file=gfs.t12z.pgrb2.0p25.f006&amp;lev_10_m_above_ground=on&amp;lev_boundary_layer_cloud_layer=on&amp;lev_convective_cloud_bottom_level=on&amp;lev_convective_cloud_layer=on&amp;lev_convective_cloud_top_level=on&amp;lev_entire_atmosphere=on&amp;lev_entire_atmosphere_%5C%28considered_as_a_single_layer%5C%29=on&amp;lev_high_cloud_bottom_level=on&amp;lev_high_cloud_layer=on&amp;lev_high_cloud_top_level=on&amp;lev_surface=on&amp;all_var=on&amp;leftlon=-160&amp;rightlon=150&amp;toplat=20&amp;bottomlat=30&amp;dir=%2Fgfs.2017041012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grib filter tool generated URL</a> selecting for the proper layers and variables, this data appears to be just initial values (1 for cloud cover) and 9999 for many of the other values.  I read a lot of <a href=""https://www.americanwx.com/bb/topic/38773-gfs-cloud-cover-what-does-it-mean/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gfs grib &amp; cloud details here</a> that suggest the .fxxx files like ""gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006"" are </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cloud % field is probably output from some of the model physics (microphysics I guess) routines, which may not be setup to write out the fields after the very first model time step (the f00 files denote fields after the first model time step, not the actual analysis/initial condition).  We do in fact initialize the cloud condensate field, however</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is where are the TCDC cloud data numbers in the GFS grib models?  They don't seem to be in the analysis files (<a href=""http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.anl.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.anl</a>) or the FH000 file.</p>

<p>Note:  I'm using grib_api tools to read these fields (grib_ls and grib_get).  I've used them successfully for currents and winds, but I can't seem to find the right GFS data for TCDC cloud cover.</p>

<p>the gfs.t12z.pgrb2.0p25.anl file didn't contain cloud data, so I tried one of the .fxxx files (gfs.t12z.pgrb2.1p00.f384).  There appeared to be fields set, but they were at initial values according to grib_ls tool.  Here's a snippet:</p>

<p>Edit 2:  It appears that computing the cloud cover has to be done from the GFS layer data however it appears how it is done is unclear based on an old message from 2007:  <a href=""http://www.weather-watch.com/smf/index.php/topic,20158.msg216087.html#msg216087"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.weather-watch.com/smf/index.php/topic,20158.msg216087.html#msg216087</a></p>

"When do winds gets stronger?","<p>Do winds on Earth always gets stronger when the temperature is higher or are winds only increasing when the temperature gets higher.</p>

<p>So the difference is that when temperatures áre higher (with a constant level) that there is less difference in temperatures but in case of gétting a higher temperature the differences of temperatures are higher and that causes stronger winds?</p>

<p>So is a high temperature the most important factor or the increase of the temperature?</p>

"Identifying different parts of a cave","<p>Hopefully this is on topic here - I'm wondering if there are names for the different ""biomes"" that are present within a cave. </p>

<p>Some of these ""biomes"" include:</p>

<li>Dark, little to no natural light (""standard"" cave)</li>
<li>Containing an underground stream or lake, potentially supporting aquatic life</li>
</ul>

<p>I know little about caves, but they (can) have diverse areas that give rise to all sorts of interesting creatures. Are there any specific names given to the different parts of a cave?</p>

"How much warming there was over time for a specific month?","<p>I'm calculating warming trends in specific places and periods of time, that are related to the time a migratory bird spends in a stopover. But using different methods I got different results and I'm trying to figure out which is the most accurate. I know it will depend on location, so my sites are Southeast Canada and the Arctic. How much warming is possible in 40 years for example in a period covering only one month in spring, like May? What would be a good value to compare my results? spring temperature warming trend?</p>

<p>There's a lot of fluctuation in temperatures, so when averaging them I get no changes, including in the Arctic, which cannot be true. I looked at trends of the maximum temperatures and they are increasing, also investigated the anomalies, but I would like to have an advice.</p>

"How to relate RCM/GCM RCP climate projections to observational data for use in a hydrologic model","<p>As a (smaller) part of my research, I want to look at climate projection data and how that might influence the hydrology within a study catchment in Rajasthan, India. For ""the present day"" climate, I run a simple soil moisture model that gives an estimate of the groundwater recharge.</p>

<p>I aquired MPI-ESM data for the pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 downscaled as part of the CORDEX project for the years 2006-2100. The annual means (or sums, in case of precipitation) are shown below for r1i1p1.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NM1HE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NM1HE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
However, the mean annual observational values for the last few decades are:</p>

<pre><code>variable,               value
u2_m_per_s              2.28
rh_mean                 46.88
actual_sunshine_hrs_day 7.17
tmean_degree            25.05
precipitation_mm        568
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the variables, such as windspeed, are not yet adjusted to the same reference height, however the most striking deviation is the predicted precipitation, which even for the ""present"" is far off.</p>

<p>What simple possibilities are there to transform the RCP data to ""fit"" the observational data in the beginning of the projections? As mentioned, this is a side part and there are no resources for an elaborate approach.
Would it be possible to normalize the RCP timeseries with its own ""beginning"", say the mean of the variables of the first twenty years, and then multiply it with the observational values above? That way I would get move the beginning of the time series closer to the observations while still maintaining the (relative) trend in the data.</p>

<p>Normalized to the mean 2006-2020 values:</p>

<p>How would one then continue? I'm aware that the signal is only within the trend, so would I look at two years, e.g. 2050 and 2080, that both are represented as the mean values of the year +- 15 years, similar to the data provided by WorldClim? Also, would I calculate the means time-step wise? </p>

"What does geochemical data tell us about Earth's earliest palaeoclimatic conditions?","<p>Given that the age of the oldest zircon samples are about 4.4 billion years old, and meteorites and other extraterrestrial samples can also give us some indication about the Earth's composition into the Hadean era (source: <a href=""http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/earth/cs_zircon_chronolgy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zircon Chronology: Dating the Oldest Material on Earth</a>.</p>

<p>Many resources refer to the earliest atmosphere as being (for example):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a result of the high temperatures at the center of the Earth, and due to volcanic activity, the crust emitted halogen gasses, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and other gasses. In the following 100 million years, these gasses accumulated to form the primordial atmosphere.  This atmosphere was quite similar to the atmosphere of Titan, one of the larger moons of Saturn.  The primordial atmosphere is believed to have reached a pressure of 250 atmospheres and would have been extremely toxic to life as we now know it</p>

"Can impact events cause widespread volcanic activity on the other side of the planet?","<p>The currently accepted theory for P-T mass extinction is environmental change triggered by the Siberian Traps volcanic activity.</p>

<p>A paper<sup><a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GC002149"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(1)</a></sup> suggests that the Siberian Traps were caused by a hotspot created after an impact event on what was back then the antipode of Siberia: the Wilkes Land crater.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, the impact may have triggered the “Great Dying” at the end of the Permian and contributed to the development of the hot spot that produced the Siberian Traps and now may underlie Iceland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, another more recent review paper<sup><a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.10.009"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(2)</a></sup> mostly discredits this theory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally the recent report of a 500-km-diameter impact structure of possible Permian–Triassic age in the Antarctic<sup><a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GC002149"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(1)</a></sup>, is based entirely on satellite gravity measurements, provides no geological context, and completely ignores the absence of any predictable regional and global geological effects from such a large impact event, e.g., the absence of any thick ejecta layer at nearby Antarctic Permian–Triassic boundary sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving aside the discussion of whether such a thing caused the formation of the Siberian Traps and thus the P-T mass extinction, <strong>in theory, can an impact on one side of the Earth cause volcanism on its antipode?</strong></p>

<p>Also very important, <strong>why would this happen</strong>? <strong>What's the supposed mechanism that converts short term seismic activity to volcanic activity derived from long term hot spots</strong>?</p>

<p>Note that I'm not asking about <em>in situ</em> volcanic activity (such as the case of Sudbury). The impact also has to be reasonable in magnitude: I don't consider the moon-forming event that destroyed the young Earth as a reasonable impact in magnitude.</p>

<p>Focusing on a watershed that cross from CST into EST - if it was raining at 10am EST, and also raining at 9am CST (raining at the timezone division, with weather stations on either side of the timezone division), it's raining at the same time, we are just marking the 'time' differently in each location.  However, if I transformed my date/time into GMT, with a new column tracking the offset (maybe to convert it back later), it would be the same GMT time in both locations that the rain was occurring?  In effect, it is just shifting all the weather into the same time zone, and then merging based on IDW.</p>

"How about local impacts of deforestation on droughts and floods?","<p>In fields like economics, people tend to think that catastrophic events like droughts, floods, desertification, landslides, soil erosion etc. are events which are linked to global climate change and global $\ce{CO2}$ emissions or they think these events could be exogeneous events (they argue that floods come from the massive rainfalls which are due to whole climate change problem or they think that droughts are mainly caused by the average increase of global temperature).</p>

<p>In some sense, I agree with these arguments but my intuition is that events like droughts, floods and desertification are events which are also due to local activities, such as deforestation or loss of wetlands.</p>

<p>I explain this intuition in more detail. When we cut down trees, this reduces the land's ability to absorb water from rainfall and this directly increases the frequency and severity of floods. I know that deforestation in Indonesia contributes to the whole climate change problem but <strong><em>are there not any local impacts of this deforestation in Indonesia directly concerning droughts and floods on this region?</em></strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n8/full/nclimate2277.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Morgano et al. (2014)</a> shows that there exists a massive deforestation in Indonesia.

"Dating fluvial terraces with $^{10}\rm{Be}$","<p>I've completed part A of the question below.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Dating fluvial terraces with $^{10}\rm{Be}$</h3>

<p>One way to determine the age of an alluvial deposit is to collect a series of samples from a range of depths, from the surface down to a few meters, and analyze the cosmogenic nuclide concentration. The expectation is to find an exponential-like decline in concentration with depth, with an asymptotic value that reflects the inherited concentration. Suppose you sample an alluvial deposit on a mesa surface near Boulder and find the values that are shown in Table 1.</p>

<pre><code>10Be C      26AL C     Depth (m)
4.29E+06    2.62E+07     0.0
2.44E+06    1.64E+07    -0.5
1.88E+06    1.24E+07    -0.9
1.49E+06    9.80E+06    -1.3
1.27E+06    8.32E+06    -1.7
1.12E+06    6.89E+06    -2.5
9.99E+05    6.46E+06    -3.1

C units (atoms/gram*year)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>A</strong> Use a spreadsheet (or if you prefer, a script in Python, Matlab, etc.) to make a plot that shows the $^{10}\rm{Be}$ and $^{26}\rm{Al}$ concentrations as a function of depth. Make depth your y-axis, and have the values increase downwards.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong> Make an initial guess about (1) how old the terrace is, and (2) how much of the Beryllium concentration is inherited from when the sediment was first deposited (the exact numbers you use in your guess don’t matter, since you will change them). Then use your spreadsheet to calculate the expected $^{10}\rm{Be}$ concentration that each sample should have if it had the inheritance and age that you have specified.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong> Quantify the error in your guess by calculating, for each sample, the root-mean square error: (i) take the difference between the sample age and your guess, (ii) square it (to make the number positive no matter which way you’re off), (iii) take the square root, (iv) take the average.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong> Now, iteratively adjust (1) your guess at the age and (2) your guess at the inheritance, until you find a pair of values that come as close as you feel you can reasonably get.</p>

<p><strong>E</strong> In your paper, present and describe a graph of the sample data that also shows your best-guess curve. Discuss this “best fit” estimate of the age of the terrace. What is the root-mean square error? Can you think of a procedure that would be more systematic than trial-and-error guessing?</p>

"Cloud in a bottle experiment. Why does the ""cloud"" get thicker with repeated squeezing?","<p>I have done the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8AvfXar9zs"" rel=""nofollow"">cloud in a bottle experiment (Youtube video)</a> with a thermometer probe in the bottle to show the temperature increase and decrease.  I am interested in the nature of the changes as the cloud nuclei get covered with water and then as the water evaporates (almost instantly) with the increased pressure as you squeeze the bottle.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the subject,  evaporation of a cloud droplet absorbs energy and the formation of a droplet releases energy. I find it interesting (and counter intuitive) that when you release pressure,  cloud droplets form (meaning that the droplets themselves are releasing  energy).  Why are they releasing  energy in a system that is already going to a lower energy state?  Seen as a part of the system,  as a speck of smoke at the start of the pressure drop,  they have no energy to begin with!    </p>

<p>I would also like to see a theory about this. Where the things that happen are related to how catalysts work.  Smoke is a catalyst in this case.  And where the condensation nuclei are acting almost like ""buffers"" in acid base theory.  A buffer in acid base acts as a proton donor or proton acceptor   to reduce pH fluctuations. Maybe the condensation nuclei can be seen as doing the same thing to reduce temp, and pressure changes in the cloud? </p>

<p>So, anyways, a cloud droplet forms around a condensation nucleus.  Energy is released, while water vapor is absorbed from the gas around the nucleus.   As the droplet falls into lower humidity air,  it releases droplet water as water vapor with absorption of energy. On the one hand,  more water vapor is more volume, but on the other hand,  the lower temperature as the droplet absorbs energy as the water vapor is released  causes lower pressure.  I do not know where the balance lies.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>About practical application of gravity normal:</p>

<p>I have some tall object that stand on Earth (like Leaning Tower of Pisa) and I can obtain GPS coordinates of it top and bottom points by using photos taken from air and applying photogrammetry methods. Then from GPS coordinates of top and bottom of object I can get vector in ECEF coordinates and find angle betwen this vector and gravity vector. </p>

<p>Also my question:</p>

<p>If difference in angle between ellipsoid normal and geoid normal(""deflection of the vertical"") is about 100 seconds of arc (0,0277778 degree) is it safe to use ellipsoid normal for this practical application?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>First:</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand if normal to ellipsoid is sufficient for practical application.
In real life object is mounted by using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spirit level</a> and on this picture we can see that theoretically I need normal to geoid, but if deflection of vertical small enough I can use normal to ellipsoid as approximation.</p>

<p>Second:</p>

<p>I'm trying to estimate the error of angle measure, I have some error in calculating of GPS positions of my object top and bottom points say epsilon_1, also I have some error in calculating gravity vector because of I'm using normal to elispoid say epsilon_2 and I'm trying to understand how epsilon_1 and epsilon_2 affects resulting angle between object vector and gravity vector. So I need to derive the formula that will give me measurement error of angle using measurement error of GPS points and gravity vector(epsilon_1 and epsilon_2).</p>

"Does the Nasa video show proof of the biotic pump theory?","<p>(Edited). Biotic pump theory (2006): <em>Forests cause enhanced transpiration and precipitation and create areas of low pressure that suck in more moisture in a positive feedback loop</em>.</p>

<p>A few years ago an international team found the mechanism for enhanced precipitation.  They found that fungi release potassium salts late at night, as they release spores, and that plants release turpenes and isoprenes in the morning and these sublime onto the salt in the sunlight  to form extremely good condensation nuclei. Source: <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6098/1075.full"" rel=""nofollow"">Biogenic Potassium Salt Particles as Seeds for Secondary Organic Aerosol in the Amazon</a></p>

<p>I made <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwGzAwOyla4"" rel=""nofollow"">a video about this</a>.<br />The second part, from about 7 minutes into the video, clearly shows cumulonimbus clouds forming at approximately 3 to 4 pm over forested areas of Cuba, Florida and Mexico. This is consistent with the biotic pump theory.</p>

<p>The biotic pump theory is that enhanced transpiration and precipitation  over forested areas causes low pressure areas and attracts wind (laden with moisture) from elsewhere.</p>

<p>To create a low pressure area, the clouds have to remove some gas from the area,  and they do so by transporting air up into the next layer of the atmosphere. The ""tail"" of the hurricane (the stream of wind delivered to the upper atmosphere by the hurricane actually demonstrates that this is happening.</p>

<p>When its tail  passes over those areas,  its moisture condenses on the condensation nuclei that have passed up through the cloud with the dry air into that higher layer of the atmosphere.   The main problem that the biotic pump theory has is that it was proposed by nuclear physicists. They suggest that several of the ""assumptions"" on which meteorology are based violate the laws of thermodynamics. Coming from mere nuclear physicists,  this should give people pause for thought. But the biggest problem has been a communication problem.  The meteorological community have found the mathematics they use almost incomprehensible.</p>

"How bad is geo-engineering?","<p>It is just curiosity that forced me to ask this question. At some point in time, if we can't control global $\sf{CO_2}$ emissions, temperature will increase until a tipping point and it will be a complete catastrophe. However, if we could prepare ourselves through geo-engineering (e.g. carbon removal, blocking solar radiation), then we may return the temperature back to normal. I am not saying that we have to experiment with mother Earth, but if we may do weather-engineering experiments in controlled labs just like the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), we may some day be able to save the planet from catastrophe. </p>

<p>So, my question is, how bad does geo-engineering go as far as controlled experiments done in totally isolated labs? </p>

<p>In NWP models, it is mostly possible to control the evolution of $\sf{CO_2}$, solar radiation, moisture, temperature etc. Given the current computation power is better than in the past and will most likely be better in the future, once we have calibrated and validated those climate/weather models, can we use them to fight extremes of weather like floods, drought, hurricanes and all other wind storms?</p>

<p>The accuracy of current weather predictions is better for forecasts 5-10 days ahead. So, this may give enough time to do controlled simulations before and after our intervention. Based on that we may act on to, for example, increase precipitation (e.g. through controlled spraying of condensation nuclei) where there is drought, hit and disperse hurricanes or change their directions before they hit and damage cities etc. How wrong can one be to think like that? </p>

"Should total ground heat flux be 0?","<p>In the context of the land surface, the ground absorbs heat from radiation (also some times from precipitation and advection), and releases heat through evapotranspiration, advection and radiation, and run-off. If it were a closed system, you would expect the net heat loss/gain to be zero (at least on a reasonably long time scale, that irons out daily and seasonal cycles, and noise). However, there is also heat from the mantle to consider, and also heat conduction to the oceans.</p>

<p>Are there other avenues for heat loss or gain from the soil? Are any of these significant in a climatological context? Or should the total heat flux into (or out of) the ground from the atmosphere be equal to zero (or close enough for practical purposes, over time scales longer than a year)?</p>

"Are cloudy nights warmer than nights without clouds?","<p>I have noticed this winter that nights without clouds (especially when the 12h before the night where not cloudy) were way colder than the cloudy ones. </p>

<p>It makes sense to me because the clouds can reflect the heat (infrared?) earth have accumulated during the day rather than loosing it into the atmosphere (like a kind of blanket). But I could be ""swayed"" by a confirmation bias here, so here is my question:</p>

<p>Is there a correlation between temperature and cloud, <strong>during the night</strong>?</p>

"Dry atmospheric temperature profile (dry adiabatic vs. isothermal)","<p>I'm trying to understand why there are differing predictions of the atmospheric temperature profile. It is well established that the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}z} = -\frac{g}{c_p} \approx -9.8\ \mathrm{K/km}
$$</p>

<p>This is derived by assuming adiabatic process and hydrostatic pressure gradient:</p>

<p>$$
\mathrm{d}s = c_p\mathrm{d}\ln{T} - R\mathrm{d}\ln{p}\quad(= \frac{\delta q}{T} = 0)\\
\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}z} = -\rho' g
$$</p>

<p>where $\rho'$ is density of ambient air, and pressure of an air parcel is the same as ambient pressure ($p = p'$). It is essenitally the cooling an air parcel will experience due to change in ambient pressure when risen adiabatically in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>However, when using the principle of maximum entropy (i.e. looking for the equilibrium profile) we get <em>isothermal profile</em>, as predicted classically by Gibbs and Boltzmann.</p>

<p>Apparently, the actual atmospheric profile (where there is no moisture condensing) is consistent with the dry adiabatic lapse rate much more than with the isothermal profile. The actual profile is of course subject to continuous thermal cooling of the atmospheric layers, thermal warming by radiation from the Earth's surface, heating from the surface by conduction (by turbulence and molecular diffusion), and during the day to solar heating. These factors can obviously affect any equilibrium.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What causes the discrepancy? Is there a consensus?</p></li>
<li><p>If there was initially a DALR profile, would it eventually turn into an isothermal profile if there was no influence (no radiation, no surface, no dynamic phenomena).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My impression is that when radiative processes (thermal cooling and thermal heating from surface) are included in the maximum entropy calculation, one might get some sort of lapse rate, i.e. something between a pure thermal radiative profile and the isothermal profile.</p>

<p>I found some papers discussing the issue, esp.:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Verkley WTM., Gerkema T, 2003. <a href=""http://www.nioz.nl/files/upload/users/258010/2004-JAS.pdf"">On Maximum Entropy Profiles</a>. <em>Journal of atmospheric sciences</em>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>where they treat potential temperature as something which is conserved when applying the maximum entropy principle in order to reach a profile with a lapse rate. But it is not clear to me why such an assumption should be made, or if there is any general consensus that this is the right approach.</p>

"Long-term Wind Speed Forecasting: reality or wishful thinking?","<p>I have been studying/working with Wind Energy for a while and, one of my main responsabilities right now is to search for adequate <strong>long-term wind speed forecasting models</strong>.</p>

<p>However, 2 things strike me about this quest.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wind speed forecasting is a task of great complexity for wind speed itself is highly stochastic. It depends on climate patterns, regional weather behavior, topography and atmospheric stability, or the lack of thereof, just to mention a few. </p></li>
<li><p>The very own idea of ""long-term"" varies from researcher to researcher. So far I've found authors who claim that 1 to 7 days can be considered long-term <em>(Current status and future advances for wind speed and power forecasting,Jung &amp; Broadwater, 2014)</em>; but also those who say one full year is the minimum threshold for long-term forecasting <em>(The quality of weather information for forecasting of intermittent renewable generation, Sokolowska &amp; Hossa, 2014)</em>. It's clear that forecasting horizon is highly linked to the aim of your research; therefore, when topics change, so will their forecasting horizons.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Isn't there a consensus about what long term means when it deals with wind speed forecasting?</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Can it be assumed year(s)-long wind speed forecasting withsignificant accuracy  is still some far-fetched, wishful thinking?</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> What are some efficient models out there yielding meaningful results?</p>

"Can climate models reliably predict meteorological extremes?","<p>This question is related to and extension of my previous question which was about the methodology used to predict future climatic extremes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/2789/what-is-the-methodology-to-analyze-future-climatic-extremes-using-the-results-of"">What is the methodology to analyze future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?</a></p>

<p>Although the answer to that question is quite detailed and informative, it is still not clear to me <strong>whether the models used in global climate (GC) simulations can predict rare (~1000-year return period events)</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I understand that if we have multi-thousand simulations, we can
calculate the 0.1% quantile, but I do not know whether the applied
models can predict rare events reliably. Under reliably, I mean that
in some alignment with the observed extremes or with the extremes
statistically inferred from the observations.</li>
<li><strong>All the papers I saw so far, which dealing with extremes due to
climate change, are considering 20-year return period events as
maximum</strong> and comparing the simulations to observed quantiles. This is
one source of my suspicion regarding the reliability of GCMs.</li>
<li>Are GCMs calibrated to observed mean or multiple quantiles? Daily,
monthly, annual, etc. averages are used? Averages of larger areas or
grid points (corresponding to the applied resolutions) are adopted in
the calibration, validation processes? What are the typically used
target parameters used in the calibrations?</li>
<li>Here is an example to make it more clear: one wants to determine the
probability distribution function of extreme wind speed in a given
location from daily measurements/simulation results. The question: If we take one
simulation for the 1950-2000 period and assume for a moment that
model uncertainty is negligible compared to climate variability, can
we treat the simulation data as a sample with more or less equivalent
confidence than that of the actual observations, corresponding to the
same period, to infer large return period extremes?</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to check this is would be to compare the large return period extremes inferred from observed data and from multiple simulations, I have not seen any papers with above 20-year return level comparison yet.
I see that we cannot expect very accurate models regarding e.g. 1000-year extremes, because we cannot reliably calibrate and validate GCMs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The available measurements are from a 100-200 year observation period (at best);</li>
<li>We do not have too much data from different climatic conditions (there might be some phenomena which are not (or not adequately) taken into account in current models, we are somehow biased by the observed, prior 100 year conditions.</li>

"Nuclear testing and the Anthropocene, a chemostratigraphic link?","<p>The Anthropocene is described by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene"">Wikipedia</a> as</p>

  <p>an informal geologic chronological term for the proposed epoch that began when human activities had a significant global impact on the Earth's ecosystems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to its informal nature and not wide acceptance, there is often debate among adherents about when the Anthropocene is supposed to have started. <em>Note: this is not a question about this debate.</em></p>

<p>A working group recently suggested in the article <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214009136"">When did the Anthropocene begin? A mid-twentieth century boundary level is stratigraphically optimal</a> (Zalasiewicz et al. 2015) has taken a different approach, looking at the effects of human activity on the chemostratigraphic record, suggesting that the Anthropocene epoch ought to have its beginning at the start of the nuclear age.  </p>

<p>From the article's abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We propose an appropriate boundary level here to be the time of the world's first nuclear bomb explosion, on July 16th 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico; additional bombs were detonated at the average rate of one every 9.6 days until 1988 with attendant worldwide fallout easily identifiable in the chemostratigraphic record. Hence, Anthropocene deposits would be those that may include the globally distributed primary artificial radionuclide signal, while also being recognized using a wide range of other stratigraphic criteria. </p>

<p>This question is <em>not</em> about the legitimacy of such an epoch, but looks at the main point of the working group's findings that radionuclides from nuclear testing may have a measurable imprint on the chemostratigraphic record.</p>

"Why does the Inter tropical Convergence Zone shift?","<p>I am currently learning at school about the climatic conditions (mainly winds, difference in pressure, Coriolis effect, etc.) that cause and affect the monsoons received by India.</p>

"Why deep ocean didn't freeze during snowball Earth?","<p>I know that at least twice in its history Earth was totally frozen. I also know that the last time it happened there were already life on Earth, and it survived. In deep water, under the ice, which was transparent enough for light to penetrate it and support life. </p>

<p>My question is, why didn't all the water freeze? AFAIK Earth was frozen for 10 million years, so I think it was enough time. Something must have kept deep water from freezing, what was it? Geothermal warmth? Underwater volcanoes? Both seem to be too weak sources of energy for keeping deep ocean liquid.</p>

<p>The same about Antarctica. I know there was a lake found deep under thick ice, why didn't it freeze?</p>
"
"How do we use oxygen isotopes as temperature proxy?","<p>As far as I know scientists use oxygen isotope 16 to 18 ratio in air trapped in glaciers (or in old foraminiftera shells) as proxy for temperature in the past. I know that $\ce{^18O}$ is heavier, and it precipitates faster, and $\ce{^16O}$ is lighter, and it evaporates faster.</p>

<p>I understand that when it's warmer, there is more evaporation and more heavy isotope left in water. Vapor moves toward poles, where it falls as rain or snow and goes back to water (this doesn't count) or stays in glacier for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>So when it's warm, we should have more $\ce{^18O}$ in ocean sediments, and less in arctic glaciers, right? So more $\ce{^16O}$ (less $\ce{^18O}$) in glaciers -> warm period.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when it's cold, precipitation occurs earlier while air moves to the poles, and heavy isotope falls down earlier, on bigger latitudes. In the air that goes to the poles there is only little heavy isotope left. So more $\ce{^16O}$ (and less $\ce{^18O}$) in glaciers -> cold period. This is contrary to the above. So how to figure out temperature from ice and sediments cores?</p>

"Does temperature affect partial pressure of gas dissolved in water?","<p>I am trying to understand the behavior of oxygen dissolved in seawater. I have always been under the impression that if a gas is in equilibrium between its gaseous and aqueous forms, that it will always have the same partial pressure in the air as in the water. For example, both air and air saturated seawater have a pO2 of 21.227 kPa (101.325 kPa x 20.95%). I recently, however, came across <a href=""http://www.presens.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Tools_Utilities/Oxygen_Unit_Calculation_dv1_1.xls"">this</a> tool from a company that creates dissolved O2 measuring devices which indicates that temperature has an effect on this relationship. It indicates that if atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kPa (pO2 in the atmosphere = 21.222 kPa) then the pO2 in seawater could be anything from 21.094 kPa at 0*C to 20.331 at 30*C.</p>

<p>If this is true, what causes this relationship? How can I calculate expected seawater pO2 given atmospheric pressure and temperature?</p>

"If the distance between Earth and the moon were changed, would the effects be immediate?","<p>I need your help on a possible (but perhaps low probability) scenario for how the distance between Earth and the moon could change: say a large object from the Kuiper Belt manages to make its way into the inner system. It passes by our moon such that its gravity changes the moon's orbit around Earth into a more pronounced ellipse. So there will be times when the moon is much closer to Earth and other times when it's further away than its current distance from Earth. </p>

<p>Say that this change in the moon's orbit isn't enough to cause an apocalyptic scenario for life on Earth but that the tides are of course much, much more pronounced. I surmise that the greatest impact would be felt in costal towns and cities around the world. My question is: how long would it take for the change in the moon's orbit to be felt on Earth? Are we talking almost immediately/ within the hour for some unlucky areas that are now much closer to the moon on its new orbit, and at most within 12 hours for the ""luckier"" areas? Or would the time frame be much longer?</p>

"Will global climate change alter the interannual and/or intraseasonal variance of temperature and/or precipitation?","<p>A quick skim of the regional chapters in AR5 shows predicted changes to average temperature and precipitation.  If I understand (in rough terms) the modelling methodologies used, a variety of models (an ensemble) are run many times each, each with different initial conditions.  The output is $\mathbf{Y}_{xyztmi}$ where $xyzt$ are coordinates and time, $m$ is a model, $i$ is one run of a specific model, and $Y$ is some modeled climate variable.  The ensemble mean prediction at time $t$ for gridcell $xyz$ is just the average over $m$ and $i$.  </p>

"Shallow water height as vertical coordinate","<p>In atmospheric physics we use often a variety of vertical coordinates, $z$ the height above some reference surface, or $r$ as distance from the planetary center.</p>

<p>However sometimes it simplifies the equations we want to solve by using other coordinates, Pressure $P$, LogPressure, Potential temperature $\theta$,...</p>

<p>One vertical coordinate I want to specifically ask about is the shallow water height. It is defined by looking at the hydrostatic stability approximation
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = \rho_0 g$$
then integrating over a variable height $h(x,y)$ so that we arrive at constant pressure $P(h)$ we get easily
$$P(z)=\rho_0 g (h-z)+P(h) $$</p>

<p>So $h(x,y)$ is now the variable height between two Iso-Pressure surfaces in some planetary fluid.<br>
Now we can express the navier-stokes-equation, mass equation, thermodynamic equation in terms of $h$. I guess this will be very familiar to those who could answer me.</p>

<p>My question is now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming no vertical mixing (=geostrophic movement on isobaric surfaces), can I now build a vertical model of the planet consisting of a multitude of shallow fluid-layers? Namely I'd take $h1(x,y)$ as between $p1$ and $p2$, $h2(x,y)$ between $p2$ and $p3$,... and thus build up and atmosphere of a gas giant between $\sim 10^{-1} bar$ and several $10^2$ bars.</li>
<li>And more important: when could this approach be totally wrong?</li>
</ul>

<p>Naively I'd expect this to be OK in my case, as I'm still effectively integrating over the whole planet, but I hoped for some experts opinion on this. </p>

"How are Mauna Loa $\ce{CO2}$ monthly trends computed?","<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I am trying to figure out how $\ce{CO2}$ concentration trends are computed in the data provided by the Earth Systems Research Laboratory Mauna Loa Observatory. The data contains monthly measurements, seasonally corrected trend, and interpolated data with filled gaps. The trend and interpolated data should be computable from the raw averages. I was trying to reproduce the results of computing the trend and interpolation, but my values keep being slightly off.</p>

<p>I have tried two formulas to compute the
trend that I call <em>formula1</em> and <em>formula2</em> below and neither reproduces the data exactly, though formula2 seems to fit pretty well.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YVNu9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>The data <a href=""http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/"">(esrl.noaa.gov)</a> is made available as a text file structured as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#  (-99.99 missing data;  -1 no data for #daily means in month)
#
#            decimal     average   interpolated    trend    #days
#             date                             (season corr)
1958   3    1958.208      315.71      315.71      314.62     -1

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
</code></pre>

<p>Here <em>average</em> is the average from monthly measurements of $\ce{CO2}$ concentration in ppm units, <em>#days</em> is the number of valid days' measurements per month if available.</p>

<p>The other two columns, <em>interpolated</em> and <em>trend</em> are a bit more involved. The file describes the method to compute the values as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""interpolated"" column includes average values from the preceding column
  and interpolated values where data are missing.  Interpolated values are
  computed in two steps.  <strong>First</strong>, we compute for each month the average seasonal
  cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal
  cycle is allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the ""trend""
  value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in
  the ""trend"" column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months.
  The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle
  value and the trend value for the missing month.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The formulas</h2>

<p>In order to avoid dealing with boundary effects I compare the results past the first 3.5 years of record, so that centered 7-year windows can be correctly defined. That is starting from September 1961.</p>

<p>Let $x_t, t=1..N$ be the monthly average values. </p>

<p>I need to first compute ""<em>the average seasonal
cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value</em>"". And then substract it from the data to obtain the trend.</p>

<p>As I understand the average seasonal cycle is the difference between the seasonal filter and some seasonal average.</p>

<p>To compute the 7-year seasonal filter for each $t \geq 3*12 + 6$ I compute $s_t = \frac{1}{7}\Sigma_{j=-3}^{j=3}x_{t+12j}$.</p>

<p>No for a seasonal average I tried two options.</p>

<ol>
<li>The 7-year seasonal filter average
$f_t=\frac{1}{12}\Sigma_{j=0}^{j=11}s_{t+j}$</li>
<li>The 7-year average $a_t=\frac{1}{84}\Sigma_{j=-42}^{j=41}x_{t+j}$</li>
</ol>

<p>Thereby <em>formula1</em> is $x_t-(s_t-f_t)$ and <em>formula2</em> is $x_t-(s_t-a_t)$.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It seems to me that I misunderstand what is meant by ""<em>the average seasonal
cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value</em>"". Neither $(s_t-f_t)$, nor $(s_t-a_t)$ defined above fit. What is the correct formula?</p>

<p>I have put the data into a read-only (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D1ndBLGDfF5t65754HiXE_bVtgNwR1GDvwOFOCJ7J2A/edit?usp=sharing"">Google sheet</a>) for a quick check.</p>

"Why Vp/Vs and not Vs/Vp?","<p>The relation between shear wave velocity (V<sub>s</sub>) and pressure wave velocity (V<sub>p</sub>) is often expressed as V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub>. Wouldn't the opposite be more logic? V<sub>s</sub>/V<sub>p</sub> would never lead to division with zero and the relation would always be a neat number between 0 and 1. </p>

<p>What are the reasons behind this convention?</p>

"How are critical loads of nitrogen deposition on eco-regions determined?","<p>Natural habitats have a ""critical load"" threshold in regards to deposition of nitrogen compounds (both wet and dry deposition).  The critical load is calculated in kg N / hectare and is specific to local ecoregion type.  I've heard that critical loads are based on lichens or other simple vegetation, but I'm not sure.  How are critical loads calculated?  What are the factors that are considered?</p>

<p>An example of critical loads are shown below for the western USA. In general the ecoregions are pretty coarse and in my mind over-generalized.  I'm curious about how these ecoregion distinctions are made.  How many types of ecoregions are there and what are they based on?Is it based on the vegetation that currently exists in that area (which can sometimes be distinctly different than indigenous vegetation)?  Or is it based on some historical vegetation type?  Furthermore, what is the expected result if deposition surpasses the critical load and what is the time horizon involved? <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6obK.png"" alt=""Critical Load by Eco-Region"">!</p>

"How and why do these tree-like river structures form?","<p>I noticed these detailed tree-like river structures in Google Earth</p>

<p>How and why do these form?  Rivers don't typically split.  What would cause the water to keep branching off again and again, forming these tree-like fractal patterns?  I count as many as 7-8 branch splits even in the smaller trees.</p>

<p>I expect the answers will provide qualitative explanations, but if anyone can connect it to quantitative physical models that would be even better (e.g. diffusion limited aggregation, viscous fingering, dielectric breakdown all have analogous mechanisms behind them; could this one be related?)</p>

"The climatological variance of albedo, soil moisture in weather models","<p>Looking at WRF currently but I am sure this applies to most weather models there is a file (specifically <code>LANDUSE.TBL</code>) that specifies USGS derived albedo, soil moisture and other parameters on a biannual basis - one for summer and one for winter. </p>

<p>Why would not these parameters vary on a more seasonal basis and/or on a annual basis? Why are these these variables assumed to be constant? Would not changing vegetation or land cover modifications affect these values on a regional basis as well as their impact on regional climate? </p>

<p>Also would it make sense to model these values on a regional basis after deriving them from remote sensing as indicated in the below mentioned article <a href=""http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jasone/publications/evansetal2012a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jasone/publications/evansetal2012a.pdf</a></p>

"Converting glacier volume to mass: what ice density to use?","<p>The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 0 °C (under atmospheric pressure).</p>

<p>I know of two factors that may influence this (are there more?)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pressure</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/FAQ.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glaciology faq (<em>Common Questions and Myths about Glaciers</em>)</a> at the Alaska Science Center of the  U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) mentions for glacier depth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good guess is that the ice thickness is about one-half of the surface width of the glacier. Although few glaciers have been measured, the measured thicknesses range from a few tens of meters for small glaciers to about 1,500 meters for the largest glaciers in Alaska.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the density of ice change significantly with depth?</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wikipedia article on ice</a> mentions the density of ice increasing slightly with decreasing temperature, and the different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phases</a> of ice under pressure, but nothing on density.</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of air</p>

<p>Googling for <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=pressure+ice+density"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pressure ice density</a> the (my) first search finds <a href=""http://www.igsoc.org:8080/journal/3/27/igs_journal_vol03_issue027_pg568-573.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Density of glacier ice</a> at the International Glaciological Society. This focuses on air in glaciers making the density <em>lower</em>, and concludes that at larger depths we reach that 0.92 limit:</p>

"TRMM rainfall measurement for synoptic systems","<p>I have gone through the website of TRMM that explains how the TRMM satellite gather precipitation data- <a href=""http://pmm.nasa.gov/node/158"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pmm.nasa.gov/node/158</a>.  During the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), we have synoptic systems that deliver rainfall during the months of June through September. These systems are spread over days and often provide continuous rainfall i.e. they are continuous atmospheric processes. How does the TRMM satellite, which I do not believe is a geostationary satellite, 'continuously' measure the rainfall over a wide region of space? </p>

<p>Now one way they could overcome that is they mention they have a dozen such satellites that measure the precipitation but do those dozen satellites coordinate their work as in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-train_(satellite_constellation)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A-train satellite constellation</a>? If they do not coordinate their work they probably return to the same location every few hours to make a measurement. </p>

<p>If that is true what sort of assumptions are made  about what happens between these observations from a algorithms perspective to derive precipitation values? </p>

"Are there any geological periods found on top of each other that have dinosaurs of that period with in them?","<p>In diagrams, It is common to depict geological periods to be directly on top of each other with fossils of that period within them. When looking for evidence of this, I have only found examples of trilobites and shells. However it is common to see this sort of ordering depicted with dinosaurs in them <a href=""http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/complex_life/fossil_record.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/complex_life/fossil_record.html</a></p>

<p>In high school my teacher said that at the grand canyon we find no fossils at the bottom, further up we find shells, above that we find jellyfish, then fish, then reptiles, then mammals. After doing research I found out that this was not the case. Now I suspect that diagrams that depict this ordering of the fossil record with dinosaurs maybe deception or at least a representation of the fossil record that can be easily misinterpreted by laymen.</p>

<p>So are there any examples of this ordering with dinosaurs? eg Jurassic layer with Jurassic fossils, then on top of that layer there is a Cretaceous layer with Cretaceous fossils? </p>

<p>Note: I know the wording of the question is quite terrible. Feel free to edit it.</p>
